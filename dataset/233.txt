a political party in the parliaments of England  Scotland  Great Britain  Ireland and the United Kingdom  Between the     s and     s  the Tories contested power with their rivals  the Whigs  In       the first Tories emerged in England as Jacobites  when they opposed the Whig supported Exclusion Bill which set out to disinherit the heir presumptive James  Duke of York  who eventually became James II of England and VII of Scotland  During the Second Jacobite Revolution  involving James III  The Pretender   the Tories secretly worked with the Swedes and French in planning a revolution and coup funded by the French and carried out by the Swedes  modeled on William of Orange s invasion  with        Cavalry troops delivered by ship  according to Voltaire in his History of Charles XII  However  Casper Von Bothmer intercepted a letter    from Baron Von Gortz  which revealed the plan  which had the support of the Tories and  though they denied it  six of the leading Whigs   This party ceased to exist as an organised political entity in the early     s  although it was used as a term of self description by some political writers  in some cases as an insult  A few decades later  a new Tory party would rise to establish a hold on government between      and       with William Pitt the Younger followed by Robert Jenkinson   nd Earl of Liverpool     While Anglican  there was a factional support for Roman Catholicism  The Earl of Liverpool was succeeded by fellow Tory Arthur Wellesley   st Duke of Wellington  whose term included the Catholic emancipation  This occurred mostly due to the election of Daniel O Connell as a Catholic MP from Ireland  When the Whigs subsequently regained control  the Representation of the People Act      removed the rotten boroughs  many of which were controlled by Tories  In       the Tory ranks were reduced to     MPs  Under the leadership of Robert Peel  the Tamworth Manifesto was issued and began to transform the Tories into the Conservative Party  However  Peel lost many of his supporters by repealing the Corn Laws  causing the party to break apart     One faction  led by Edward Smith Stanley    th Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli  survived to become the modern Conservative Party  whose members are commonly still referred to as Tories as they still often follow and promote the ideology of Toryism      Contents    Name   History

English politics during the Exclusion Bill crisis of            Whig  from whiggamore  a  cattle driver   was initially a Scottish insult for the Covenanter faction in Scotland who opposed the Engagers  a faction who supported Charles I during the Second English Civil War and supported the Whiggamore Raid that took place in September           While the Whigs were those who supported the exclusion of James  the Duke of York from the succession to thrones of Scotland and England and Ireland  the Petitioners   the Tories were those who opposed the Exclusion Bill  the Abhorrers   In       David Hume wrote   The court party reproached their antagonists with their affinity to the fanatical conventiclers in Scotland  who were known by the name of Whigs  The country party found a resemblance between the courtiers and the popish banditti in Ireland  to whom the appellation of Tory was affixed  And after this manner  these foolish terms of reproach came into public and general use  and even at present seem not nearer their end than when they were first invented     History edit  English Civil War edit  The first Tory party could trace its principles and politics to the English Civil War which divided England between the Royalist or Cavalier supporters of King Charles I and the supporters of the Long Parliament upon which the King had declared war  This action resulted from this parliament not allowing him to levy taxes without yielding to its terms  In the beginning of the Long Parliament         the King s supporters were few  and the Parliament pursued a course of reform of previous abuses  The increasing radicalism of the Parliamentary majority  however  estranged many reformers even in the Parliament itself and drove them to make common cause with the King  The King s party thus comprised a mixture of supporters of royal autocracy and of those Parliamentarians who felt that the Long Parliament had gone too far in attempting to gain executive power for itself and  more especially  in undermining the episcopalian government of the Church of England  which was felt to be a primary support of royal government  By the end of the     s  the radical Parliamentary programme had become clear  reduction of the King to a powerless figurehead and replacement of Anglican episcopacy with a form of Presbyterianism  This prospective form of settlement was prevented by a coup d  tat which shifted power from Parliament itself to the Parliamentary New Model Army  controlled by Oliver Cromwell  The Army had King Charles I executed and for the next eleven years the British kingdoms operated under military dictatorship  The Restoration of King Charles II produced a reaction in which the King regained a large part of the power held by his father  However  Charles  ministers and supporters in England accepted a substantial role for Parliament in the government of the kingdoms  No subsequent British monarch would attempt to rule without Parliament  and after the Glorious Revolution of       political disputes would be resolved through elections and parliamentary manoeuvring  rather than by an appeal to force  Charles II also restored episcopacy in the Church of England  His first Cavalier Parliament began as a strongly royalist body  and passed a series of acts re establishing the Church by law and strongly punishing dissent by both Roman Catholics and non Anglican Protestants  These acts did not reflect the King s personal views and demonstrated the existence of a Royalist ideology beyond mere subservience to the Court  A series of disasters in the late     s and     s discredited Charles II s governments  and powerful political interests  including some who had been identified with the Parliamentary side in the Civil War  began to agitate for a greater role of Parliament in government  coupled with more tolerance for Protestant dissenters  These interests would soon coalesce as the Whigs  As direct attacks on the King were politically impossible and could lead to execution for treason  opponents of the power of the Court framed their challenges as expos s of subversive and sinister Catholic plots  Although the matter of these plots was fictitious  they reflected two uncomfortable political realities  first  that Charles II had  somewhat insincerely  undertaken measures to convert the kingdom to Catholicism  in a      treaty with Louis XIV of France   second  that his younger brother and heir presumptive  James  Duke of York  had in fact converted to Catholicism  an act that many Protestant Englishmen in the     s saw as only one step below high treason  The Whigs tried to link the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  the Duke of Ormonde  with the foremost Irish Tory  Redmond O Hanlon  in a supposed plot to murder Titus Oates  The Whig Bishop of Meath  Henry Jones  offered O Hanlon a pardon and a bribe if he would testify to Parliament that Ormonde was plotting a French invasion  In December       the government seized these letters and the plan collapsed  In January      the Whigs first began calling the supposed Irish plotters Tories  and on    February      is recorded the first complaint from an English Royalist about the epithet Tory by the anti Exclusion newspaper Heraclitus Ridens    T hey call me scurvy names  Jesuit   Papish  Tory  and flap me over the mouth with their being the only True Protestants      Within a few months anti Exclusionists were calling themselves Tories and a northern Dissenter called Oliver Heywood recorded in October   Ms  H  of Chesterfield told me a gentleman was at their house and had a red Ribband in his hat  she askt him what it meant  he said it signifyed that he was a Tory  whats that sd she  he ans  an Irish Rebel    oh dreadful that any in England dare espouse that interest  I hear further since that this is the distinction they make instead of Cavalier and Roundhead  now they are called Torys and Wiggs        Glorious Revolution edit  In a more general sense  the Tories represented the more conservative royalist supporters of Charles II  who endorsed a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the power of Parliament  and who saw in the Whig opponents of the Court a quasi Republican tendency  similar to that seen in the Long Parliament  to strip the monarchy of its essential prerogative powers and leave the Crown as a puppet entirely dependent upon Parliament  That the Exclusion Bill was the central question upon which parties diverged  did not hinge upon an assessment of the personal character of the Duke of York  though his conversion to Catholicism was the key factor that made the Bill possible   but rather upon the power of Parliament to elect a monarch of its own choosing  contrary to the established laws of succession  That the Parliament  with the consent of the King  had such power was not at issue  rather  it was the wisdom of a policy of creating a King whose sole title to the Crown was the will of Parliament and who was essentially a Parliamentary appointee  On this original question  the Tories were in the short run entirely successful as the Parliaments that brought in the Exclusion Bill were dissolved  Charles II was enabled to manage the administration autocratically and upon his death the Duke of York succeeded without difficulty  The rebellion of Monmouth  the candidate of the radical Whigs to succeed Charles II  was easily crushed and Monmouth himself executed  However  in the long run Tory principles were to be severely compromised  Besides the support of a strong monarchy  the Tories also stood for the Church of England  as established in Acts of Parliament following the restoration of Charles II  both as a body governed by bishops  using the Book of Common Prayer whilst subscribing to a specific doctrine and also as an exclusive body established by law  from which both Roman Catholics and Nonconformists were excluded  During his reign  James II fought for a broadly tolerant religious settlement under which his co religionists could prosper a position anathema to conservative Anglicans  James  attempts to use the government controlled church to promote policies that undermined the church s own unique status in the state led some Tories to support the Glorious Revolution of       The result was a King established solely by parliamentary title and subject to legal controls established by Parliament  the principles that the Tories had originally abhorred  The Tories  sole consolation was that the monarchs chosen were close to the main line of succession as William III was James II s nephew and William s wife Mary was James s elder daughter  The Act of Toleration      also gave rights to Protestant dissenters that were hitherto unknown  while the elimination of a large number of bishops who refused to swear allegiance to the new monarchs allowed the government to pack the episcopate with bishops with decidedly Whiggish leanings  In both these respects the Tory platform had failed  but the institutions of monarchy and of a state Church survived   Balanced ministries and opposition edit  Despite the failure of their founding principles  the Tories remained a powerful political party during the reigns of the next two monarchs  particularly that of Queen Anne  During this time  the Tories fiercely competed with the Whigs for power  and there were frequent Parliamentary elections in which the two parties measured their strength  William III saw that the Tories were generally more friendly to royal authority than the Whigs  and he employed both groups in his government  His early ministry was largely Tory  but the government gradually came to be dominated by the so called Junto Whigs  This tight knit political grouping was opposed by the Country Whigs led by Robert Harley  who gradually merged with the Tory opposition in the later     s  Although William s successor Anne had considerable Tory sympathies and excluded the Junto Whigs from power  after a brief and unsuccessful experiment with an exclusively Tory government she generally continued William s policy of balancing the parties  supported by her moderate Tory ministers  the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin  The stresses of the War of the Spanish Succession which begun in      led most of the Tories to withdraw into opposition by       so that Marlborough and Godolphin were heading an administration dominated by the Junto Whigs  Anne herself grew increasingly uncomfortable with this dependence on the Whigs  especially as her personal relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough deteriorated  This situation also became increasingly uncomfortable to many of the non Junto Whigs  led by the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Shrewsbury  who began to intrigue with Robert Harley s Tories  In early       the prosecution by the Whig government of the ultra Tory preacher Henry Sacheverell for sermons delivered the previous year  led to the Sacheverell riots and brought the ministry into popular discredit  In the spring of       Anne dismissed Godolphin and the Junto ministers  replacing them with Tories  The new Tory ministry was dominated by Harley  Chancellor of the Exchequer  later Lord Treasurer  and Viscount Bolingbroke  Secretary of State  They were backed by a strong majority in the Parliament elected in       rallying under the banner of  Church in Danger   This Tory government negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht in       which pulled Great Britain out of the War of the Spanish Succession  to the dismay of Britain s allies  including Anne s eventual successor  George  Elector of Hanover   the peace was enacted despite a Whig majority in the House of Lords  which Anne defeated by creating new Tory peers  Following a long disagreement between the ministers  Anne dismissed Harley in       The arch Tory Bolingbroke became in effect Anne s chief minister and Tory power seemed to be at its zenith  However  Anne was extremely ill and died within a few days  Bolingbroke had not been able to formulate any coherent plans for dealing with the succession  for if he thought of proclaiming the son of James II  the Pretender  king  he made no moves to do so  The Elector George succeeded to the throne entirely peacefully  supported by the Hanoverian Tory grouping   Proscription and the Whig supremacy edit  In accordance with Succession to the Crown Act       the Queen s government was replaced by a Council of Regency until the new King should arrive from Hanover  Bolingbroke offered his services to the King but was coldly rejected  George I brought in a government composed entirely of Whigs  and the new Parliament  elected from January to May       had a large Whig majority  In December      Lord Carnarvon wrote that  hardly one Tory is left in any place  though never so mean a one       The historian Eveline Cruickshanks stated that   w hat took place in      was not a change to an all Whig ministry  it was a whole social revolution       For the first time  Tory gentlemen could no longer employ their sons  as they traditionally had done  in public offices such as the Army  Navy  civil service and the Church  Tory officers in the Army had their commissions taken away  Tory lawyers could not now become judges or K C s  The predominantly Tory lower Anglican clergy could no longer become bishops and Tory merchants were refused government contracts or directorships in any major company      This proscription lasted for forty five years      George Lyttelton wrote in his Letter to the Tories          We are kept out of all public employments of power and profit  and live like aliens and pilgrims in the land of our nativity        no quality  no fortune  no eloquence  no learning  no wisdom  no probity is of any use to any man of our unfortunate denomination  ecclesiastic or layman  lawyer or soldier  peer or commoner  for obtaining the most deserved advancement in his profession  or any favour of the Crown  whilst  to our additional and insupportable vexation  the bare merit of hating us  and everything we love and hold sacred  daily advances dunces in the law and church  cowards in our fleets and armies  republicans in the King s house  and idiots everywhere      The Whig government  backed by royal favour and controlling the levers of power  was able to maintain a series of majorities through the infrequent elections of the next several decades  only   in the    years of the first two Georges  as opposed to    in the    years from the Revolution to the death of Queen Anne   For much of the period  the Tories commanded a broad base of support in rural England  but the relatively undemocratic nature of the franchise and the maldistribution of the borough seats ensured that this popular appeal was never translated into a Tory majority in Parliament  The Tories would have won every general election between      and      had the number of seats obtained corresponded to the number of votes cast      The Tories were  therefore  an effectively null factor in practical politics  a permanent minority in Parliament and entirely excluded from government  The latter exclusion  and the rigid party politics played by the Whigs  played a significant role in the cohesion of the Tories  the Whigs offered few opportunities for Tories who switched sides  and as a party the Tories found no possibilities for compromise with the Whigs    James Stuart  the Pretender during the Jacobite rising of       by gaining some Tory support it was thus used to discredit them by the Whigs The proscription of the Tories alienated them from the Hanoverian regime and converted many of them to Jacobitism      Bolingbroke later wrote   If milder measures had been pursued  certain it is that the Tories had never universally embraced Jacobitism  The violence of the Whigs forced them into the arms of the Pretender       In October       the French ambassador Charles Fran ois d Iberville noted that the number of Jacobites in the Tory party was increasing and in early      he wrote that the Tories seemed to be  heading for civil war which they regard as their only resort       The former Tory chief minister  Lord Oxford  was impeached and sent to the Tower  with Bolingbroke and the Tory peer the Duke of Ormonde fleeing to France to join the Pretender  A series of riots against the coronation of George I and the new Hanoverian Whig regime  in which the mob voiced their support for Jacobitism and local Tory parliamentary candidates  led to the Whig government strengthening their power by passing the Riot Act  suspending habeas corpus and increasing the army  including by importing       Dutch troops       Louis XIV had promised them arms but no troops  as France was exhausted by war  despite Bolingbroke s claim that just one tenth of the number of troops William of Orange brought with him in      would have sufficed      However  this promise of arms disappeared when Louis died in September       The conspirators intended to abandon the rising they had planned for the West Country  but the Scots forced their hand by unilaterally raising the Pretender s standard  One of Ormonde s agents betrayed the plans for an English rising and subsequently the government arrested many Tory MPs  ex MPs and peers      The subsequent Jacobite rebellion of         resulted in failure  However  Charles XII of Sweden was willing to aid the English Tories by sending troops to put the Pretender on the throne  in conjunction with an English rising  Lord Oxford  who had already in      offered the Pretender his services  directed the Swedish Plot from the Tower  In January       the government discovered this plot and won a vote of credit for defence measures against the projected invasion in the Commons against Tory opposition  Charles  death in      ended hopes from that quarter and Ormonde s planned Spanish invasion was destroyed by a storm at sea      During the Whig Split of       the Tories refused to back either side and adopted the same stance to Lord Sunderland s overtures in       Nonetheless their combined efforts helped the opposition win some victories  such as the defeat of the Peerage Bill in       In       Sunderland advised the King to admit leading Tories into government  thereby dividing them and ending their hopes for revenge by looking for support from abroad  He also advised the King in Cabinet that elections to Parliament should be free from government bribery  an idea Sir Robert Walpole opposed due to the possibility of the election of a Tory Parliament  The King was also opposed   King George stared the Earl of Sunderland in the face at the name of a Tory Parliament  for it seems nothing is so hideous and frightful to him as a Tory       The public outcry over the South Sea Bubble led the Tories to believe that it would not be worthwhile raising funds for the general election  as they considered a Jacobite rising would be successful considering the state of public opinion      Sunderland joined the Tories in the Atterbury Plot  in which the Pretender was to be put on the throne  A rising was planned for each county  assisted by Irish and Spanish troops  However  Sunderland s death in April      led to the government discovering the plot and it subsequently collapsed      When the Commons voted on the bill of pains and penalties against Atterbury  nearly ninety per cent of Tory MPs voted against it      Although the Whig Prime Minister Robert Walpole decided not to prosecute those Tories that he knew were involved in the plot  the Tories were demoralised and largely absented themselves from Parliament for a time      Upon the accession of George II in      and the ensuing general election  the Tories were reduced to     MPs  their lowest total up to this point      The Tories were divided over whether to cooperate with the opposition Whigs against Walpole  with those in favour consisting of the Hanoverian faction led by Sir William Wyndham and with those opposed making up the Jacobite faction headed by William Shippen      Most Tories opposed voting with the opposition Whigs  only reversing this stance when the Pretender sent a letter to the Tories in       ordering them to  unite in the measures against the Government and even with those who oppose it for different views than theirs           For the next decade  the Tories cooperated with the opposition Whigs against Walpole      Public admission of Jacobitism was treason  so the Tories challenged the Hanoverian Whig regime without specifically addressing it by developing a rhetoric borrowed from the Whigs of the Exclusion Crisis  they denounced government corruption and the high taxation needed to spend on foreign entanglements  opposed the growth of the Army and denounced  tyranny  and  arbitrary power           In a speech on the Army estimates  Walpole claimed that  No man of common prudence will profess himself openly a Jacobite  by so doing he not only may injure his private fortune  but he must render himself less able to do any effectual service to the cause he has embraced   Your right Jacobite  Sir  disguises his true sentiments  he roars out for revolution principles  he pretends to be a great friend to liberty       He further claimed that a large Army was needed to defeat any possible Jacobite invasion  In       Frederick  Prince of Wales applied to Parliament for an increased allowance  This split the Tories  with    abstaining  leading to the motion being defeated by    votes  Bolingbroke  who wanted to dissociate the Tories from Jacobitism  denounced this as  the absurd behaviour of the Tories  which no experience can cure       In      Frederick s attempts to reconcile with the Tories broke down on Wyndham s insistence that he join the Tories in favouring a reduced Army      With the outbreak of war against Spain in       there was renewed plotting amongst Tories for a Jacobite rising      Wyndham s death in      led to the breakdown of the coalition between the Tories and opposition Whigs  An opposition Whig motion for Walpole s dismissal was defeated by     to      with many Tories abstaining      At the general election of       there were     Tories elected      The Tories resumed their cooperation with the opposition Whigs after receiving another letter from the Pretender in September       ordering them to  pursue vigorous and unanimous measures in the next session of Parliament        They will probably have many occasions of greatly distressing the present Government and ministry and perhaps find some who will concur with them in that  though not out of goodwill to my cause        In such cases I hope my friends will make no scruples in joining heartily with them for whatever their particular motives may be anything that tends to the disadvantage of the present Government and to the bringing it into confusion cannot be but of advantage to my cause           As a result      Tories joined the opposition Whigs in successfully voting against Walpole s nominated chairman of the elections committee in December           The Tories continued to vote against Walpole with the opposition Whigs in subsequent divisions until Walpole was forced to resign in February           The Pretender wrote to the Tories afterwards  declaring   I cannot delay any longer expressing to you my satisfaction at the late behaviour of my friends in Parliament  and I take it as a great mark of their singular regard for what I wrote to you some months ago       In       war broke out between Britain and France  as part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession  Later that year Francis Sempill  the Pretender s representative at the French court  carried a message from English Tories to the French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  Jean Jacques Amelot de Chaillou  requesting French help for a Stuart restoration  including        French soldiers   It was signed by the Duke of Beaufort  one of the four richest people in Britain   Lord Barrymore  Lord Orrery  Sir Watkin Williams Wynn  Sir John Hynde Cotton and Sir Robert Abdy      Amelot replied that the French government would need considerable proof of English support for Jacobitism before it could act      James Butler  Louis XV s Master of Horse  toured England ostensibly for purchasing bloodstock but in reality to gauge the health of Jacobitism in England  visiting leading Tories      Before he left for England  the French king briefed him personally to assure Tory leaders that all of their demands would be met      In November      Amelot told Sempill officially that Louis XV was resolved to restore the House of Stuart and that he was planning a French invasion headed by the Pretender s son  Charles Edward Stuart      The  Declaration of King James   written by Tory leaders  was signed by the Pretender on    December  This was to be published in the event of a successful French landing      However  the Whig government was informed by a spy of the intended French invasion and King George told Parliament on    February      that a French invasion was planned  assisted by  disaffected persons from this country   The House of Commons passed a loyal address by     to          The Tories  insistence for the House to divide on this occasion seemed to the government a design by the Tories  to show the French what numbers in the House they might depend on       The Tories also opposed increasing the armed forces  it being noted  that none of the leaders amongst the Tories  either on this occasion or that of the King s first message  showed the least sign of zeal or affection to the Government       On    February  a storm scattered the French invasion fleet and suspected Jacobites were arrested  leading to the French government cancelling their planned invasion      Charles Stuart  who was still in France and determined to start a Jacobite rising  looked to Scotland  However  the English Tories would only support a rising in Scotland if accompanied by a French invasion near London to aid the English Tories in their own rising      The English Tories repeatedly told the Jacobite court that only regular soldiers invading at the same time as their rising could achieve a Stuart restoration      In December       the Broadbottom Administration was formed  which included a handful of Tories in minor offices  Some other Tories were offered places  but that serving for Jacobite counties  could not hazard a new election and therefore decline d  the acceptance of them       One of the Tories who accepted office  Sir John Cotton  did not swear the oath of loyalty to King George and informed the French King that he still favoured a Jacobite French invasion  he added that the Tories in office would try to ensure that more British soldiers were sent to Flanders from England in order to help a French invasion      After Lord Gower took office in this government  the Tories no longer looked to him as their leader as Lyttleton wrote that  when it was discovered that Gower was really a friend to the Hanover succession  the Tories discarded him for being their leader  and adopted a determined Jacobite the Duke of Beaufort in his stead       In June       the Tory leaders in the Commons  Wynn and Cotton  together with Beaufort   informed the Jacobite court that  if the Prince  Charles  lands in present circumstances with ten battalions or even smaller body of troops there will be no opposition       Tory leaders sent Robert MacCarty to France with a request for        troops and        arms to be landed in England  where they would join them upon arrival      Charles travelled to Scotland in July without consulting the Tories or the French and without a sizeable body of troops      After his landing  Sempill wrote   The City of London  Sir John Hynde Cotton  Lord Barrymore  the Duke of Beaufort  and all the English cry loudly and vehemently for a body of troops to be landed near London  as the most effectual means to support the Prince   They could not rise for the Prince without  a body of troops to support them   but they  would join the Prince if His Highness could force his way to them       Throughout the Jacobite rising of       Charles could not establish contact with the English Tories      Captain Nagle  who had visited a peer in London  reported in December that they were all being monitored by the government  but that they would declare for Charles if he made his way to London or if the French invaded      However  Charles retreated from England and the French never landed  so the English Tories did not feel safe in coming out for the Pretender  After the collapse of the rising  Charles  captured secretary  John Murray of Broughton  informed the government of the Tories  conspiracy with the Pretender  The government decided not to prosecute them      The trial of the Scottish rebel lords in London was boycotted by most Tory peers      After the Duke of Cumberland s brutal suppression of the Scots  English Tories adopted the plaid as their symbol      Eveline Cruickshanks in her study of the           Tory party for The History of Parliament  claimed that  the available evidence leaves no doubt that up to      the Tories were a predominantly Jacobite party  engaged in attempts to restore the Stuarts by a rising with foreign assistance       Sir Lewis Namier noticed that for the reigns of George I and George II  Tory family papers are non existent      As papers from before      and after      survive  Cruickshanks contends that these families were hiding their Jacobite leanings by destroying incriminating papers  A nineteenth century historian who had examined many collections such as these  claimed that it was  the custom in Jacobite days to destroy all letters with any hint of political or religious feeling in them       However  some historians  such as Linda Colley  have questioned the Tories  commitment to Jacobitism      In       Frank O Gorman noted that given the nature of the evidence  it is unlikely that the question will ever be answered  but added that  judged by the acid test of how they behaved in the     and     most Tories showed themselves to be Hanoverian and not Jacobite       In       Prince Frederick invited the Tories  to unite and coalesce with him  and declared his intention that when he became King  he would  abolish   all distinction of the party  and put an end to the proscription of the Tories  A meeting of leading Tories  including Beaufort  Wynn and Cotton  accepted the Prince s offer and replied assuring him of their support for his  wise and salutary purposes   However  they refused to pledge themselves to a coalition with Whigs      The      general election resulted in only     Tory MPs being elected  their lowest figure up until this point      After Jacobite riots in Oxford in       the government wanted to give the King the power to nominate the Chancellor of the University of Oxford  which was considered a hotbed of Jacobitism and Toryism  Thomas Carte wrote to the Pretender that  the attempt against the university of Oxford brought them all up at once to town  which nothing else would  and in their zeal on that account  they entered into a sort of coalition with Prince Frederick s party to stand by the university of Oxford  to join in opposing all unconstitutional points  but to be under no obligation to visit Prince Frederick s court  nor unite in other points        After Wynn s death in       a Jacobite agent reported to the Pretender that the Tory party was  without a head   dispirited and frightened      In      Frederick died  followed in      by Cotton  This effectively ended opposition in Parliament for the rest of the session      Horace Walpole  in his memoirs for       wrote of the decline of the Tory party  Hitherto it might be said that the two parties of Whig and Tory still subsisted  though Jacobitism  the concealed mother of the latter  was extinct   The subsequent contests were rather a struggle for power than the settled animosity of two parties  though the body of Opposition still called itself Whig  an appellation rather dropped than disclaimed by the Court  and though the real Tories still adhered to their own distinctions while they secretly favoured  sometimes opposed  the Court  and fluctuated accordingly as they esteemed particular chiefs not of their connection or had the more agreeable opportunity of distressing those who supported the cause of freedom  As their whole conduct was comprised in silent votes  and never was considerable enough to turn a single scale in the political changes  I shall seldom mention them anymore      Period of uncertainty and the Conservative Party edit  Dickinson reports the following   All historians are agreed that the Tory party declined sharply in the late     s and     s and that it ceased to be an organized party by       The research of Sir Lewis Namier and his disciples       has convinced all historians that there were no organized political parties in Parliament between the late     s and the early     s  Even the Whigs ceased to be an identifiable party  and Parliament was dominated by competing political connections  which all proclaimed Whiggish political views  or by independent backbenchers unattached to any particular group      Upon the accession of George III  the old political distinctions dissolved  The Whig factions became in effect distinct parties  such as the Grenvillites and the Bedfordites   all of whom claimed the Whig mantle  while the material distinction in politics was between the  King s Friends  who supported the newly activist role of George III in government  and those who opposed the king  The proscription on the employment of Tories in government offices ended  which resulted in the Tories dividing into several factions and ceasing to function as a coherent political party  Sentimental Toryism remained  as in the writings of Samuel Johnson  but in politics  Tory  was little more than an unfriendly epithet for politicians closely identified with George III  The label  Tory  was in this sense applied to the Prime Ministers Lord Bute             and Lord North              but these politicians considered themselves Whigs  In his study of the debates in Parliament for            P  D  G  Thomas discovered that not a single politician labelled themselves a Tory      J  C  D  Clark similarly argues that   t he history of the Tory party in parliament between the early     s and the late     s may be simply written  it did not exist         William Pitt the Younger Applied by their opponents to parliamentary supporters of the younger William Pitt                         the term Tories came to represent the political current opposed to the Old Whigs and the radicalism unleashed by the American and French Revolutions  This was reinforced by the breakup of the Whig party in      when the conservative group led by the Duke of Portland joined Pitt s ministry   leaving an opposition rump led by Charles James Fox  The historian J  C  D  Clark has written of the     s   It cannot be too clearly stressed that no public figure at that date accepted the title  Tory   and that they had the best reasons for denying its appropriateness       Pitt rejected the Tory label  preferring to refer to himself as an independent Whig  for he believed in the current constitutional arrangement as being well balanced  without particular favour towards the royal prerogative  unlike the Tories of the first half of the   th century  The group surrounding Pitt the Younger came to be the dominant force in British politics from      until      and after Pitt s death        the ministers in the Portland ministry             called themselves the  Friends of Mr Pitt  rather than Tories  Portland s successor  Spencer Perceval  Prime Minister              never adopted the label of Tory and after his assassination        the members of the government of Lord Liverpool             firmly rejected it in a ministerial memorandum to the Prince Regent  It is almost unnecessary to observe that the British Government had for more than a century been and could only be a Whig Government  and that the present administration is  as every administration in this country must necessarily be  a Whig administration  For a Whig Government means now  as it has all along meant  nothing else than a Government established by laws equally binding upon the King and the subject      Generally  the Tories were associated with lesser gentry  the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in Scotland while Whigs were more associated with trade  money  larger land holders or land magnates and the Nonconformist Protestant churches  Both were still committed to the political system in place at that time  The new Tory party was distinct both in composition and ideological orientation from the old  It consisted largely of former Whigs  alienated from the party that now bore that name  While it maintained a sentimental and conservative respect for the symbolic institutions of the British monarchy  in practice Tory ministries allowed the King no more freedom than Whig ones  The incompetence of George III s personal interventions in policy had been sufficiently shown in the American War              henceforward his active role was limited to negations of government policies such as the Catholic emancipation  In foreign policy  the differences were even more marked as the old Tory party had been pacific and isolationist whereas the new one was bellicose and imperialistic  The Tories became associated with repression of popular discontent after       but the Tories later underwent a fundamental transformation under the influence of Robert Peel  who was an industrialist rather than a landowner  Peel in his      Tamworth Manifesto outlined a new conservative philosophy of reforming ills while conserving the good  The subsequent Peel administrations have been labelled Conservative rather than Tory  but the older term remains in use  When the Conservative Party split in      on the issue of free trade  the protectionist wing of the party rejected the Conservative label  They preferred to be known as Protectionists or even to revive the older Tory as an official name  By      the Peelites  Peel s Conservative supporters  joined the Whigs and Radicals to form the Liberal Party  The remaining Tories  centred under the leadership of the Earl of Derby  a former Whig  and Disraeli  once a Radical candidate for Parliament   adopted the Conservative label as the official name of their party   Electoral performance edit  Great Britain and England edit    Election  Leader  Seats       Position  Government         Sir Edward Hyde                 st  Majority
