them of  conspiracy  misappropriating from the company  and attempting to cover up   Havas alleged that the three directors had signed new employment contracts during the takeover that gave them

Nanterre Court said that specifically  the provisions of this Convention relating in particular to access to the case file  the personal assistance of counsel during the investigation and the balance between the parties had not been met  In its decision  the Court considered that  given the weight and complexity of the case  which had     items   a preliminary investigation was not the most appropriate way of proceeding  Instead  the case should have been by instruction  which allows adversarial examination  Les Echos     November          The criminal court of Nanterre dismissed the last of these cases in November       citing  the lack of equity and violation of the rights of the defence       Olivier Metzner and Olivier Bluche  lawyers for Alain de Pouzilhac and Jacques H rail
