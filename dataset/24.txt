The National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA    n s    is an independent agency of the U S  federal government responsible for the civilian space program  as well as aeronautics and space research  note    NASA was established in       succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  NACA   The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation  encouraging peaceful applications in space science           Since its establishment  most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA  including the Apollo Moon landing missions  the Skylab space station  and later the Space Shuttle  NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft  the Space Launch System  and Commercial Crew vehicles  The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program  which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches  NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System      advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate s Heliophysics Research Program      exploring bodies throughout the Solar

documentary about NASA From       the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  NACA  had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X        In the early     s  there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year            An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard  After the Soviet space program s launch of the world s first artificial satellite  Sputnik    on October          the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts  The U S  Congress  alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership  known as the  Sputnik crisis    urged immediate and swift action  President Dwight D  Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures  On January           NACA organized a  Special Committee on Space Technology   headed by Guyford Stever     On January           NACA Director Hugh Dryden published  A National Research Program for Space Technology  stating       It is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge  Sputnik  be met by an energetic program of research and development for the conquest of space     It is accordingly proposed that the scientific research be the responsibility of a national civilian agency     NACA is capable  by rapid extension and expansion of its effort  of providing leadership in space technology      While this new federal agency would conduct all non military space activity  the Advanced Research Projects Agency  ARPA  was created in February      to develop space technology for military application      On July           Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act  establishing NASA  When it began operations on October          NASA absorbed the    year old NACA intact  its       employees  an annual budget of US     million  three major research laboratories  Langley Aeronautical Laboratory  Ames Aeronautical Laboratory  and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory  and two small test facilities      Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA  A significant contributor to NASA s entry into the Space Race with the Soviet Union was the technology from the German rocket program led by Wernher von Braun  who was now working for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency  ABMA   which in turn incorporated the technology of American scientist Robert Goddard s earlier works      Earlier research efforts within the US Air Force     and many of ARPA s early space programs were also transferred to NASA      In December       NASA gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology        Spaceflight programs X    program             Main article  North American X     X    in powered flight NASA inherited

and a speed of about     miles per hour      km h   citation needed  Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force  Navy  and NACA  A total of     flights were made between June      and December       resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a crewed powered aircraft  current as of      update    and a maximum speed of Mach             miles per hour        km h       The altitude record for X    was         feet         km       Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force astronaut wings for flying above         feet     km   and two flights by Joseph A  Walker exceeded     kilometers          ft   qualifying as spaceflight according to the International Aeronautical Federation  The X    program employed mechanical techniques used in the later crewed spaceflight programs  including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft  space suits  and horizon definition for navigation      The reentry and landing data collected were valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle       Project Mercury             Main article  Project Mercury  L  Gordon Cooper  photographed by a slow scan television camera aboard Faith         In       NASA formed an engineering group  the Space Task Group  to manage their human spaceflight programs under the direction of Robert Gilruth  Their earliest programs were conducted under the pressure of the Cold War competition between the U S  and the Soviet Union  NASA inherited the US Air Force s Man in Space Soonest program  which considered many crewed spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the X     to small ballistic space capsules      By       the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule      and NASA renamed it Project Mercury  The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy  Air Force and Marine test pilot programs  On May          astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard a capsule he named Freedom    launched on a Redstone booster on a    minute ballistic  suborbital  flight      John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit  on an Atlas launch vehicle on February           aboard Friendship        Glenn completed three orbits  after which three more orbital flights were made  culminating in L  Gordon Cooper s    orbit flight Faith    May                  Katherine Johnson  Mary Jackson  and Dorothy Vaughan were three of the human computers doing calculations on trajectories during the Space Race              Johnson was well known for doing trajectory calculations for John Glenn s mission in       where she was running the same equations by hand that were being run on the computer      Mercury s competition from the Soviet Union  USSR  was the single pilot Vostok spacecraft  They sent the first man in space  cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin  into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok   in April       one month before Shepard s flight      In August       they achieved an almost four day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok    and also conducted a concurrent Vostok   mission carrying

the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long duration flights  developing space rendezvous techniques  and precision Earth landing  Project Gemini was started as a two man program in      to overcome the Soviets  lead and to support the Apollo crewed lunar landing program  adding extravehicular activity  EVA  and rendezvous and docking to its objectives  The first crewed Gemini flight  Gemini    was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March               Nine missions followed in      and       demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days  rendezvous  docking  and practical EVA  and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans          Under the direction of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev  the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two  or three man Voskhod  They succeeded in launching two crewed flights before Gemini s first flight  achieving a three cosmonaut flight in      and the first EVA in       After this  the program was canceled  and Gemini caught up while spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev developed the Soyuz spacecraft  their answer to Apollo   Project Apollo             Main article  Apollo program  Buzz Aldrin on the Moon       The U S public s perception of the Soviet lead in the Space Race  by putting the first man into space  motivated President John F  Kennedy     to ask the Congress on May           to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the     s  which effectively launched the Apollo program      Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever  It cost more than     billion in     s dollars     or an estimated      billion in present day US dollars       In comparison  the Manhattan Project cost roughly       billion  accounting for inflation           It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles  which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects      The spacecraft was also bigger  it had two main parts  the combined command and service module  CSM  and the Apollo Lunar Module  LM   The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module  CM  containing the three astronauts would return to Earth  note    The second crewed mission  Apollo    brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December           Shortly before  the Soviets had sent an uncrewed spacecraft around the Moon      On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced         and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo    mission in July           The first person to walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong  who was followed    minutes later by Buzz Aldrin  while Michael Collins orbited above  Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon  the last in December       Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights  twelve men walked on the Moon  These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and       kilograms      lb  of lunar samples  Topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics  meteoroids  seismology  heat flow  lunar ranging  magnetic fields  and solar wind      page needed  The Moon landing marked the end of the space race  and as a gesture  Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon      Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight  It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit  and landing humans on another celestial body      Apollo   was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body  while Apollo    marked the last moonwalk and the last crewed mission beyond low Earth orbit  The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and crewed spaceflight  including avionics  telecommunications  and computers  Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks  Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world  notably at the Smithsonian s Air and Space Museums   Skylab             Main article  Skylab  Skylab in       seen from the departing Skylab   CSM  Skylab was the United States  first and only independently built space station      Conceived in      as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent Saturn IB upper stage  the         lb         kg  station was constructed on Earth and launched on May           atop the first two stages of a Saturn V  into a     nautical mile      km  orbit inclined at     to the equator  Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity generating solar panel  it was repaired to functionality by its first crew  It was occupied for a total of     days by   successive crews in      and           It included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity  and a solar observatory      NASA planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it  and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude  but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab s re entry on July               To save cost  NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab  Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station  Three three man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of         and    days  Skylab s habitable volume was        cubic feet      m    which was      times bigger than that of the Apollo Command Module       Apollo Soyuz             Main article  Apollo Soyuz  Soviet and American crews with spacecraft model        On May           US President Richard M  Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint crewed space mission  and declaring intent for all future international crewed spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other      This authorized the Apollo Soyuz Test Project  ASTP   involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo command and service module with a Soyuz spacecraft  The mission took place in July       This was the last US human spaceflight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April           The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US Russian space flights  such as the Shuttle Mir program     and the International Space Station   Space Shuttle program             Main article  Space Shuttle program  NASA s  Worm  logo was used from      to      and reinstated as a secondary identifier in            Launch of Space Shuttle Discovery at the start of STS      The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late     s and the     s  Originally planned as a frequently launchable  fully reusable vehicle  the design was changed to use an expendable external propellant tank to save on development cost  and four Space Shuttle orbiters were built by       The first to launch  Columbia  did so on April           the   th anniversary of the first known human spaceflight      Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid fuel launch rockets at its side  The external tank  which was bigger than the spacecraft itself  was the only major component that was not reused  The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of         km          miles      and carry a maximum payload  to low orbit  of        kg         lb       Missions could last from   to    days and crews could be from   to   astronauts      On    missions             the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab  designed in cooperation with the European Space Agency  ESA   Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight  but remained in the Shuttle s cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock      On June           Sally Ride became the first American woman in space  on board the Space Shuttle Challenger STS   mission      Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in      and       respectively      In       Russian American interaction resumed with the Shuttle Mir missions              Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft  this time a full fledged space station  This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built  the International Space Station  ISS   The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the      Space Shuttle Columbia disaster  The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and    astronauts in two disasters  Challenger in       and Columbia in           While the      loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts  NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss      NASA s Space Shuttle program had     missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July           The program spanned    years with over     astronauts sent into space       International Space Station       present  Main article

JAXA   the European Space Agency  ESA   and the Canadian Space Agency  CSA           The station consists of pressurized modules  external trusses  solar arrays and other components  which were manufactured in various factories around the world  and have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets  and the US Space Shuttles      page needed  The on orbit assembly began in       the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in      and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment occurred in       though there are some debates of whether new modules should be added in the segment  The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements     which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment  with the exception of Zarya           with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners      Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions  Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS      The initial expedition crew size was three  temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster  Since May       expedition crew size has been six crew members      Crew size is expected to be increased to seven  the number the ISS was designed for  once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational      The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past    years and    days  having exceeded the previous record held by Mir  and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from    different nations          The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and  as of       is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station      The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members  stays docked for their half year long missions and then returns them home  Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the ISS  they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since       the European Automated Transfer Vehicle  ATV  since       the Japanese H II Transfer Vehicle  HTV  since       the SpaceX Dragon from      until       and the American Cygnus spacecraft since       The Space Shuttle  before its retirement  was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members  although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay  Until another US crewed spacecraft is ready  crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz      The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen  this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions

Moon base by       and by       have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in situ resource utilization  However  in       the Augustine Committee found the program to be on an  unsustainable trajectory       In February       President Barack Obama s administration proposed eliminating public funds for it       Commercial Crew Program       present  This section is an excerpt from Commercial Crew Program edit  Logo of the Commercial Crew Program The Commercial Crew Program  CCP  is a human spaceflight program operated by NASA  in association with American aerospace manufacturers Boeing and SpaceX  The program conducts rotations between the expeditions of the International Space Station program  transporting crews to and from the International Space Station  ISS  aboard Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon capsules  in the first crewed orbital spaceflights operated by private companies  The program succeeds NASA s involvement in the Soyuz program  upon which it was dependent to transport its astronauts to the ISS following the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in       Each mission in the Commercial Crew Program will send up to four astronauts to the ISS aboard either a Crew Dragon or Starliner  with options for a fifth passenger being available to NASA  Crew Dragon spacecraft are launched to space atop a Falcon   Block   launch vehicle and return to Earth via splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean   Starliner spacecraft are launched atop an Atlas V N   launch vehicle and return on land with airbags on one of four designated sites in the western United States  SpaceX s first operational mission in the program launched on    November           while Boeing s first mission is due to launch in       Development of the Commercial Crew Program began in      through a rescope of the Commercial Crew Development  CCDev  program  a Recovery Act initiative originally aimed at funding development of various human spaceflight technologies in the private sector  While NASA had previously envisioned internally developed crewed vehicles to perform ISS crew rotation  such as the Orbital Space Plane in the early     s and the Orion spacecraft in the late     s  the agency looked instead to commercial industry to provide transport to the ISS  following cancellation of the Constellation program in      and a refocusing of Orion for crewed deep space exploration only  A series of open competitions over the following two years saw successful bids from Boeing  Blue Origin  Sierra Nevada  and SpaceX to develop proposals for ISS crew transport vehicles    Boeing and SpaceX were ultimately selected by NASA in September      to fly astronauts to the ISS  though the decision was met with an unsuccessful legal challenge from Sierra Nevada  While the first operational missions in the program were initially planned for       numerous issues during design  testing  and operation of the spacecraft and launch vehicles pushed first operational flights to      and       with additional occupations on Soyuz spacecraft up to Soyuz MS    being bought by NASA to compensate for the delays  The final test flight of Crew Dragon

was to develop American private spaceflight capabilities to get astronauts to the International Space Station  replacing Russian Soyuz capsules  and to use Orion capsules for ISS emergency escape purposes  During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April           Obama proposed a new heavy lift vehicle  HLV  to replace the formerly planned Ares V      In his speech  Obama called for a crewed mission to an asteroid as soon as       and a crewed mission to Mars orbit by the mid     s      The NASA Authorization Act of      was passed by Congress and signed into law on October               The act officially canceled the Constellation program      The NASA Authorization Act of      required a newly designed HLV be chosen within    days of its passing  the launch vehicle was given the name Space Launch System  The new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft      The Orion spacecraft  which was being developed as part of the Constellation program  was chosen to fulfill this role      The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit      The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions  The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift    t          lb   later    t or         lb  into LEO  It is then planned to be upgraded to     t

Delta IV Heavy rocket      NASA undertook a feasibility study in      and developed the Asteroid Redirect Mission as an uncrewed mission to move a boulder sized near Earth asteroid  or boulder sized chunk of a larger asteroid  into lunar orbit  The mission would demonstrate ion thruster technology  and develop techniques that could be used for planetary defense against an asteroid collision  as well as a cargo transport to Mars in support of a future human mission   The Moon orbiting boulder might then later be visited by astronauts  The Asteroid Redirect Mission was cancelled in      as

site on Mars might evolve over the course of multiple human expeditions NASA s next major space initiative is to be the construction of the Lunar Gateway   This initiative is to involve the construction of a new space station  which will have many features in common with the current International Space Station  except that it will be in orbit about the Moon  instead of the Earth       This space station will be designed primarily for non continuous human habitation   The first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be Artemis    which is to include the Orion

United States subject to the approval of the US Senate      and reports to him or her and serves as a senior space science advisor  Though space exploration is ostensibly non partisan  the appointee usually is associated with the President s political party  Democratic or Republican   and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties  The only exceptions to this have been   Democrat Thomas O  Paine  acting administrator under Democrat Lyndon B  Johnson  stayed on while Republican Richard Nixon tried but failed to get one of his own choices to accept the job  Paine

spaceflight programs throughout its history  Uncrewed robotic programs launched the first American artificial satellites into Earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes  and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system  starting with Venus and Mars  and including  grand tours  of the outer planets   Main article  List of uncrewed NASA missions Play media Video of many of the uncrewed missions used to explore the outer reaches of space More than       uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the solar system       Besides exploration  communication satellites have also been launched by NASA       The spacecraft have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles  which could either deploy the satellite itself  or with a rocket stage to take it farther  The first US uncrewed satellite was Explorer    which started as an ABMA JPL project during the early part of the Space Race  It was launched in January       two months after Sputnik  At the creation of NASA  the Explorer project was transferred to the agency and still continues to this day  Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun  measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind  among other aspects       A more recent Earth satellite  not related to the Explorer program  was the Hubble Space Telescope  which was

NASA Administrator James E  Webb  background  discussing the Mariner program  with a model presented  The inner Solar System has been made the goal of at least four uncrewed programs  The first was Mariner in the     s and     s  which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury  Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby  Mariner     to take the first pictures from another planet  Mariner     the first planetary orbiter  Mariner     and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver  Mariner      This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination       The first successful landing on Mars was made by Viking   in       Twenty years later a rover was landed on Mars by Mars Pathfinder       On November           NASA s Mars Science Laboratory mission was successfully launched for Mars  Curiosity successfully landed on Mars on August          and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars                 On the horizon of NASA s plans is the MAVEN spacecraft as part of the Mars Scout Program to study the atmosphere of Mars       Outside Mars  Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer    in       More than    years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet s atmosphere  and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet       Pioneer    became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in       with Voyager   making the first  and so far only  visits to Uranus and Neptune in      and       respectively  The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer    in       For a time it was the most distant spacecraft  but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager   and Voyager         Pioneers    and    and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to extraterrestrial life            Communication can be difficult with deep space travel  For instance  it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to Pluto       Contact with Pioneer    was lost in       Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space       The New Horizons mission to Pluto was launched in      and successfully performed a flyby of Pluto on July           The probe received a gravity assist from Jupiter in February       examining some of Jupiter s inner moons and testing on board instruments during the flyby  Other active spacecraft are Juno for Jupiter and Dawn for the asteroid belt  NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt  including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans Pluto region  and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo              Cassini              and Juno       present    NEO detection Further information  Near Earth object In       there was a Congressional directive to find near Earth objects  NEOs  larger than   kilometer  and     of   kilometer sized asteroids are estimated to have been found by            In      NASA visited     Eros with the NEAR spacecraft which entered its orbit in       closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time       From the     s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories  greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected  However  many asteroids are very dark and the ones that are near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth based telescopes which observe at night  and thus face away from the Sun  NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a  full Moon  when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun  In       the US Congress mandated NASA to achieve by the year      specific levels of search completeness for discovering  cataloging  and characterizing dangerous asteroids larger than     meters      ft   Act of       H R           th        but no new funds were appropriated for this effort       As of January       it is estimated about     of the NEOs of this size have been found  although since by its nature the exact amount of NEOs are unknown the calculations are based on predictions of how many there could be       One issue with NEO prediction is trying to estimate how many more are likely to be found In       NASA reduced its estimate of the number of existing near Earth asteroids over one kilometer in diameter from             to                      Shortly thereafter  the LINEAR survey provided an alternative estimate of                    In       on the basis of NEOWISE observations  the estimated number of one kilometer NEAs was narrowed to         of which     had been discovered at the time   while the number of NEAs larger than     meters across was estimated at                         The NEOWISE estimate differed from other estimates in assuming a slightly lower average asteroid albedo  which produces larger estimated diameters for the same asteroid brightness  This resulted in     then known asteroids at least   km across  as opposed to the     then listed by CNEOS       In       using an improved statistical method  two studies reduced the estimated number of NEAs brighter than absolute magnitude        approximately over one kilometer in diameter  to                   The estimated number of asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of       approximately over     m across  rose to               double the WISE estimate       of which about a third are known as of       A problem with estimating the number of NEOs is that detections are influenced by a number of factors       NASA turned the infrared space survey telescope WISE back on in      to look for NEOs  and it found some during the course of its operation  NEOcam competed in the highly competitive Discovery program  which became more so due to a low mission rate in the     s    Due to the opposition effect over half       of the discoveries of Near Earth objects were made in      of the sky  in a       cone facing directly away from the Sun  and the vast majority       were made in     of the sky  in a     cone facing away from the Sun       Research Main article  NASA research For technologies funded or otherwise supported by NASA  see NASA spinoff technologies  NASA s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts

technologies for extracting water from the lunar soil and developing power systems  The idea will help the space agency conduct sustainable exploration of the Moon        Other activities NASA s ongoing investigations include in depth surveys of Mars  Perseverance and InSight  and Saturn and studies of the Earth and the Sun  In August       NASA accepted the donation of two space telescopes from the National Reconnaissance Office  Despite being stored unused  the instruments are superior to the Hubble Space Telescope        Environmental impact The exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems  both in Earth s atmosphere and in space  can adversely effect the Earth s environment  Some hypergolic rocket propellants  such as hydrazine  are highly toxic prior to combustion  but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning  Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels  such as kerosene  release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust       However  carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources  on average  the United States consumed             US gallons             L  of liquid fuels per day in       while a single Falcon   rocket first stage burns around        US gallons         L  of kerosene fuel per launch            Even if a Falcon   were launched every single day  it would only represent        of liquid fuel consumption  and carbon dioxide emissions  for that day  Additionally  the exhaust from LOx  and LH   fueled engines  like the SSME  is almost entirely water vapor       NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled Constellation program in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in            In contrast  ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion            On May          Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities the Goddard Space Flight Center  Greenbelt  Maryland       An example of NASA s environmental efforts is the NASA Sustainability Base  Additionally  the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED Gold rating in            In       NASA

safety and security of the facility       NASA Advisory Council In response to the Apollo   accident  which killed three astronauts in       Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel  ASAP  to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA s aerospace programs  In the aftermath of the Shuttle Columbia disaster  Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress       By       NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support  In       the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council  NAC        The NASA Authorization Act of      reaffirmed the importance of ASAP   Directives Further information  Space policy of the United States Some of NASA s main directives have been the landing of a crewed spacecraft on the Moon  the designing and construction of the Space Shuttle  and efforts to construct a large  crewed space station  Typically  the major directives originated from the intersection of scientific interest and advice  political interests  federal funding concerns  and the public interest  that all together brought varying waves of effort  often heavily swayed by technical developments  funding changes  and world events  For example  in the     s  the Reagan administration announced a directive with a major push to build a crewed space station  given the name Space Station Freedom       But  when the Cold War ended  Russia  the United States  and other international partners came together to design and build the International Space Station  In the     s  major shifts in directives include the retirement of the Space Shuttle  and the later development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket  the Space Launch System  Missions for the new Space Launch System have varied  but overall  NASA s directives are similar to the Space Shuttle program as the primary goal and desire is human spaceflight  Additionally  NASA s Space Exploration Initiative of the     s opened new avenues of exploration focused on other galaxies  For the coming decades  NASA s focus has gradually shifting towards eventual exploration of Mars       One of the technological options focused on was the Asteroid Redirect Mission  ARM        ARM had largely been defunded in       but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration  notably on a solar electric propulsion system            Longer project execution timelines leave future executive administration officials to execute on a directive  which can lead to directional mismanagement  vague  Previously  in the early     s  NASA worked towards a strategic plan called the Constellation Program  but the program was defunded in the early     s                      In the     s  NASA s administration adopted an approach to planning coined  Faster  Better  Cheaper         NASA Authorization Act of      The NASA Authorization Act of       which included       billion in funding for that fiscal year  directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early     s       Though the agency is independent  the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President        Space Policy Directive   In December       on the   th anniversary of the last crewed mission to the Lunar surface  President Donald Trump approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to Mars and beyond        We ll learn   The directive I m signing today will refocus America s space program on human exploration and discovery   It marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since      for long term exploration and use   This time  we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint  we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars   And perhaps  someday  to many worlds beyond   President Donald Trump            New NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine addressed this directive in an August      speech where he focused on the sustainability aspects going to the Moon to stay that are explicit in the directive  including taking advantage of US commercial space capability that did not exist even five years ago  which have driven down costs and increased access to space        Use of the metric system US law requires the International System of Units to be used in all U S  Government programs   except where impractical        In       the Apollo    landed on the Moon using a mix of United States customary units and metric units  In the     s  NASA started the transition towards full metrication  citation needed  and was predominantly metric by the     s       On September           a unit mixup between US and SI units resulted in a loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter       In August       NASA stated that all future missions and explorations of the Moon will be done entirely using the SI system  This was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries which already use the metric system       As of       NASA is predominantly working with SI units  but some projects still use English units  and some  including the International Space Station  use a mix of both        Budget  NASA s budget from      to      as a percentage of federal budget  An artist s conception  from NASA  of an astronaut planting a US flag on Mars  A human mission to Mars has been discussed as a possible NASA mission since the     s  Main article  Budget of NASA NASA s share of the total federal budget peaked at approximately       in      during the Apollo program  then rapidly declined to approximately    in       and stayed around that level through                 The percentage then gradually dropped  until leveling off again at around half a percent in       estimated in      at       of the federal budget        In a March      hearing of the United States Senate Science Committee  science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that  Right now  NASA s annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar  For twice that a penny on a dollar we can transform the country from a sullen  dispirited nation  weary of economic struggle  to one where it has reclaimed its   th century birthright to dream of tomorrow             Despite this  public perception of NASA s budget differs significantly  a      poll indicated that most Americans believed that     of the federal budget went to NASA       For Fiscal Year
