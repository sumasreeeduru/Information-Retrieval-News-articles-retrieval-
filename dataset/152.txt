was under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate and the country s     regional daimy   The period was characterized by economic growth  strict social order  isolationist foreign policies  a stable population    no more wars   and popular enjoyment of arts and culture  The shogunate was officially established in Edo on March           by Tokugawa Ieyasu  The period came to an end with the Meiji

  Consolidation of the shogunate edit  Main article  Tokugawa shogunate  Tokugawa Ieyasu  first sh gun of the Tokugawa shogunate A revolution took place from the time of the Kamakura shogunate  which existed with the Tenn  s court  to the Tokugawa  when the samurai became the unchallenged rulers in what historian Edwin O  Reischauer called a  centralized feudal  form of shogunate  Instrumental in the rise of the new bakufu was Tokugawa Ieyasu  the main beneficiary of the achievements of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi  Already a powerful daimyo  Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich Kant  area  He maintained two million koku of land  a new headquarters at Edo  a strategically situated castle town  the future Tokyo   and also had an additional two million koku of land and thirty eight vassals under his control  After Hideyoshi s death  Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the Toyotomi clan  Ieyasu s victory over the western daimy  at the Battle of Sekigahara  October           or in the Japanese calendar on the   th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the Keich  era  gave him control of all Japan  He rapidly abolished numerous enemy daimy  houses  reduced others  such as that of the Toyotomi  and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies  Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western daimy   but his assumption of the title of sh gun helped consolidate the alliance system  After further strengthening his power base  Ieyasu installed his son Hidetada             as sh gun and himself as retired sh gun in       The Toyotomi were still a significant threat  and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication  In       the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at Osaka  The Tokugawa  or Edo  period brought     years of stability to Japan  The political system evolved into what historians call bakuhan  a combination of the terms bakufu and han  domains  to describe the government and society of the period     In the bakuhan  the sh gun had national authority and the daimy  had regional authority  This represented a new unity in the feudal structure  which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of centralized and decentralized authorities  The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule  land redistribution gave them nearly seven million koku  control of the most important cities  and a land assessment system reaping great revenues  The feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of daimy   Closest to the Tokugawa house were the shinpan  or  related houses   They were twenty three daimy  on the borders of Tokugawa lands  all directly related to Ieyasu  The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu  The second class of the hierarchy were the fudai  or  house daimy    rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service  By the   th century      fudai controlled much smaller han  the greatest assessed at         koku  Members of the fudai class staffed most of the major bakufu offices  Ninety seven han formed the third group  the tozama  outside vassals   former opponents or new allies  The tozama were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million koku of productive land  Because the tozama were least trusted of the daimy   they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated  although they were excluded from central government positions  The Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan  they also had unprecedented power over the emperor  the court  all daimy  and the religious orders  The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the sh gun  who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family  The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands  To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family  Ieyasu s granddaughter was made an imperial consort in       A code of laws was established to regulate the daimy  houses  The code encompassed private conduct  marriage  dress  types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed  required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year  the sankin k tai system   prohibited the construction of ocean going ships  proscribed Christianity  restricted castles to one per domain  han  and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law  Although the daimy  were not taxed per se  they were regularly levied for contributions for military and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles  roads  bridges and palaces  The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the daimy   thus weakening their threat to the central administration  The han  once military centered domains  became mere local administrative units  The daimy  did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers  bureaucrats and commoners  Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations  already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi  through a variety of control mechanisms   Foreign trade relations edit  Main article  Sakoku  Bird s eye view of the Nagasaki bay  with the island Dejima at mid left          The San Juan Bautista is represented in Claude Deruet s painting of Hasekura Tsunenaga in Rome in       as a galleon with Hasekura s flag  red manji on orange background  on the top mast   Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga Like Hideyoshi  Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders  He wanted to make Edo a major port  but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in Ky sh  and that China had rejected his plans for official trade  he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities  The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period during which intense interaction with European powers  on the economic and religious plane  took place  It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean going Western style warships  such as the San Juan Bautista  a     ton galleon type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga to the Americas and then to Europe  Also during that period  the bakufu commissioned around     Red Seal Ships  three masted and armed trade ships  for intra Asian commerce  Japanese adventurers  such as Yamada Nagamasa  used those ships throughout Asia  The  Christian problem  was  in effect  a problem of controlling both the Christian daimy  in Ky sh  and their trade with the Europeans  By       the sh gun s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity  More restrictions came in       the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado  an island northwest of Ky sh          the execution of     missionaries and converts         the expulsion of the Spanish   and       the execution of thousands of Christians   Finally  the Closed Country Edict of      prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or  if someone left  from ever returning  In       the Dutch were restricted to Dejima  a small artificial island and thus  not true Japanese soil in Nagasaki s harbor  The shogunate perceived Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor  and so decided to target it  The Shimabara Rebellion of          in which discontented Catholic samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold marked the end of the Christian movement  although some Christians survived by going underground  the so called Kakure Kirishitan  Soon thereafter  the Portuguese were permanently expelled  members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed  all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple  and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted  respectively  to Dejima and to a special quarter in Nagasaki  Besides small trade of some outer daimy  with Korea and the Ryukyu Islands  to the southwest of Japan s main islands  by       foreign contacts were limited by the policy of sakoku to Nagasaki  The last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by         and by the     s  Christianity was almost completely eradicated  and its external political  economic  and religious influence on Japan became quite limited     Only China  the Dutch East India Company  and for a short period  the English  enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period  for commercial purposes only  and they were restricted to the Dejima port in Nagasaki  Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial    Society edit  Main article  Edo society  The house of the merchant  Fukagawa Edo Museum   Social classes during the Edo period  Tokugawa shogunate   During the Tokugawa period  the social order  based on inherited position rather than personal merits  was rigid and highly formalized  At the top were the emperor and court nobles  kuge   together with the sh gun and daimy   Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as mibunsei        the samurai on top  about    of the population  and the peasants  more than     of the population  on the second level  Below the peasants were the craftsmen  and even below them  on the fourth level  were the merchants     Only the peasants lived in the rural areas  Samurai  craftsmen and merchants lived in the cities that were built around daimy  castles  each restricted to their own quarter  Edo society had an elaborate social structure  in which every family knew its place and level of prestige     At the top were the Emperor and the court nobility  invincible in prestige but weak in power  Next came the sh gun  daimy  and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa  They had power  The daimy  comprised about     local lords of local  han  with annual outputs of        or more bushels of rice  The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals  including elegant architecture  landscaped gardens  Noh drama  patronage of the arts  and the tea ceremony     Then came the         warriors  called  samurai   in numerous grades and degrees  A few upper samurai were eligible for high office  most were foot soldiers  Since there was very little fighting  they became civil servants paid by the daimyo  with minor duties  The samurai were affiliated with senior lords in a well established chain of command  The shogun had        samurai retainers  the daimyo each had hundreds  Most lived in modest homes near their lord s headquarters  and lived off of hereditary rights and stipends  Together these high status groups comprised Japan s ruling class making up about    of the total population  After a long period of inner conflict  the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country  It created a balance of power that remained  fairly  stable for the next     years  influenced by Confucian principles of social order  Most samurai lost their direct possession of the land  the daimy  took over their land   The samurai had a choice  give up their sword and become peasants  or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer  Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north  or as direct vassals of the sh gun  the       so called hatamoto  The daimy  were put under tight control of the shogunate  Their families had to reside in Edo  the daimy  themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province  han  for the next  This system was called sankin k tai     Lower orders divided into two main segments the peasants     of the population whose high prestige as producers was undercut by their burden as the chief source of taxes  They were illiterate and lived in villages controlled by appointed officials who kept the peace and collected taxes  The family was the smallest legal entity  and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society   The individual had no separate legal rights  The      Got ke reij  was compiled from over     statutes promulgated between      and          Outside the four classes were the so called eta and hinin  those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism  Eta were butchers  tanners and undertakers  Hinin served as town guards  street cleaners  and executioners  Other outsiders included the beggars  entertainers  and prostitutes  The word eta literally translates to  filthy  and hinin to  non humans   a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the eta and hinin were not even people     Hinin were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city  Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee length and the wearing of hats     Sometimes eta villages were not even printed on official maps  A sub class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society     In the   th century the umbrella term burakumin was coined to name the eta and hinin because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods      The eta  hinin and burakumin classes were officially abolished in          However  their cultural and societal impact  including some forms of discrimination  continues into modern times        Edo       or       Photochrom print  Five albumen prints joined to form a panorama   Photographer  Felice Beato  Economic development edit   Scaled pocket plan of Edo The Edo period bequeathed a vital commercial sector to be in burgeoning urban centers  a relatively well educated elite  a sophisticated government bureaucracy  productive agriculture  a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems  and a national infrastructure of roads  Economic development during the Tokugawa period included urbanization  increased shipping of commodities  a significant expansion of domestic and  initially  foreign commerce  and a diffusion of trade and handicraft industries  The construction trades flourished  along with banking facilities and merchant associations  Increasingly  han authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts       Population edit   A set of three ukiyo e prints depicting Osaka s bustling shipping industry  by Gansuitei Yoshitoyo             By the mid   th century  Edo had a population of more than one million  likely the biggest city in the world at the time      Osaka and Kyoto each had more than         inhabitants  Many other castle towns grew as well  Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers  while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods  Around the year       Japan was perhaps the most urbanized country in the world  at a rate of around             Half of that figure would be samurai  while the other half  consisting of merchants and artisans  would be known as ch nin      In the first part of the Edo period  Japan experienced rapid demographic growth  before leveling off at around    million      Between the     s and     s  Japan had almost zero population growth  often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine  but some historians have presented different theories  such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population      At around       the population of Japan was close to    million and the figure was only around    million around the Meiji Restoration around     years later      At the same time  Japan was perhaps the most urbanized country in the world at around the year       at a rate of around             From       there were regular national surveys of the population until the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate      In addition  regional surveys  as well as religious records initially compiled to eradicate Christianity  also provide valuable demographic data       Economy and financial services edit   Tokugawa coinage   ban  Koban  Ichibuban               Nihonbashi Fish Market Prosperity  Edo period  by Utagawa Kuniyasu The Tokugawa era brought peace  and that brought prosperity to a nation of    million      of them rice farmers   Rice production increased steadily  but population remained stable   Rice paddies grew from     million ch  in      to   million by           Improved technology helped farmers control the all important flow of water to their paddies  The daimyos operated several hundred castle towns  which became loci of domestic trade   The system of sankin k tai meant that daimyos and their families often resided in Edo or travelled back to their domains  giving demand to an enormous consumer market in Edo and trade throughout the country          Samurai and daimyos  after prolonged peace  are accustomed to more elaborate lifestyles      To keep up with growing expenditures  the bakufu and daimyos often encouraged commercial crops and artifacts within their domains  from textiles to tea      The concentration of wealth also led to the development of financial markets      As the shogunate only allowed daimyos to sell surplus rice in Edo and Osaka  large scale rice markets developed there      Each daimyo also had a capital city  located near the one castle they were allowed to maintain      Daimyos would have agents in various commercial centers  selling rice and cash crops  often exchanged for paper credit to be redeemed elsewhere      Merchants invented credit instruments to transfer money  and currency came into common use  In the cities and towns  guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services      The merchants benefited enormously  especially those with official patronage  However  the Neo Confucian ideology of the shogunate focused the virtues of frugality and hard work  it had a rigid class system  which emphasized agriculture and despised commerce and merchants      A century after the Shogunate s establishment  problems began to emerge      The samurai  forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money  borrowed too much  some taking up side jobs as bodyguards for merchants  debt collectors  or artisans      The bakufu and daimyos raised taxes on farmers  but did not tax business  so they too fell into debt  with some merchants specializing in loaning to daimyos      Yet it was inconceivable to systematically tax commerce  as it would make money off  parasitic  activities  raise the prestige of merchants  and lower the status of government      As they paid no regular taxes  the forced financial contributions to the daimyos were seen by some merchants as a cost of doing business      The wealth of merchants gave them a degree of prestige and even power over the daimyos          By       rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt  The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits  The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system  and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government  One solution was reactionary cutting samurai salaries and prohibiting spending for luxuries      Other solutions were modernizing  with the goal of increasing agrarian productivity      The eighth Tokugawa shogun  Yoshimune  in office            had considerable success  though much of his work had to be done again between      and      by the shogun s chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu                  Others shoguns debased the coinage to pay debts  which caused inflation      Overall  while commerce  domestic and international  was vibrant and sophisticated financial services had developed in the Edo period  the shogunate remained ideologically focused on honest agricultural work as the basis of society and never sought to develop a mercantile or capitalistic country      By       the commercialization of the economy grew rapidly  bringing more and more remote villages into the national economy  Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high profit commercial crops and engaged in local money lending  trade  and small scale manufacturing  Wealthy merchants were often forced to  lend  money to the shogunate or daimyos  often never returned       They often had to hide their wealth  and some sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class      There is some evidence that as merchants gain greater political influence  the rigid class division between samurai and merchants were beginning to break down towards to end of the Edo period      A few domains  notably Ch s  and Satsuma  used innovative methods to restore their finances  but most sunk further into debt   The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the  Tempo era              promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni  He raised taxes  denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business  he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy       Agriculture edit  Rice was the base of the economy   About     of the people were rice farmers      Rice production increased steadily  but population remained stable  so prosperity increased  Rice paddies grew from     million ch  in      to   million by           Improved technology helped farmers control the all important flow of irrigation to their paddies  The daimy  operated several hundred castle towns  which became loci of domestic trade   Large scale rice markets developed  centered on Edo and  saka      In the cities and towns  guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services  The merchants  while low in status  prospered  especially those with official patronage      Merchants invented credit instruments to transfer money  currency came into common use  and the strengthening credit market encouraged entrepreneurship       The daimy  collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice  Taxes were high  often at around         of the harvest      The rice was sold at the fudasashi market in Edo  To raise money  the daimy  used forward contracts to sell rice that was not even harvested yet  These contracts were similar to modern futures trading  It was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced forest management policy  Increased demand for timber resources for construction  shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation  which resulted in forest fires  floods and soil erosion  In response the sh gun  beginning around       instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees  The policy mandated that only the sh gun and daimy  could authorize the use of wood  By the   th century  Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about silviculture and plantation forestry       Artistic and intellectual development edit  Education edit   Terakoya  private educational school The first shogun Ieyasu set up Confucian academies in his shinpan domains and other daimyos followed suit in their own domains  establishing what s known as han schools      hank            Within a generation  almost all samurai were literate  as their careers often required knowledge of literary arts      These academies were staffed mostly with other samurais  along with some buddhist and shinto clergymen who were also learned in Neo Confucianism and the works of Zhu Xi      Beyond kanji  Chinese characters   the Confucian classics  calligraphy  basic arithmetics  and etiquette      the samurai also learned various martial arts and military skills in schools      The ch nin  urban merchants and artisans  patronized neighborhood schools called terakoya        temple schools        Despite being located in temples  the terakoya curriculum consisted of basic literacy and arithmetic  instead of literary arts or philosophy      High rates of urban literacy in Edo Japan contributed to the prevalence of novels and other literary forms      In urban areas  children are often taught by masterless samurai  while in rural areas priests from Buddhist temples or Shinto shrines often did the teaching      Unlike in the cities  in rural Japan  only children of prominent farmers would receive education      In Edo  the shogunate set up several schools under its direct patronage  the most important being the neo Confucian Sh heik        acting as a de facto elite school for its bureaucracy but also creating a network of alumni from the whole country  Besides Shoheik   other important directly run schools at the end of the shogunate included the  Wagakuk dansho          Institute of Lectures of Japanese classics    specialized in Japanese domestic history and literature  influencing the rise of kokugaku  and the Igakukan        Institute of medecine    focusing on Chinese medicine      One estimate of literacy in Edo Japan suggest that up to a third of males could read  along with a sixth of women      Another estimate states that     of men and     of women by the end of the Edo period were literate      Some historians partially credited Japan s high literacy rates for its fast development after the Meiji Restoration       Philosophy and religion edit   Wadokei  Japanese made clockwatch    th century  Kaitai Shinsho  Japan s first treatise on Western anatomy  published in      The flourishing of Neo Confucianism was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period      Confucian studies had long been kept active in Japan by Buddhist clerics  but during the Tokugawa period  Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control  This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society  The ethical humanism  rationalism  and historical perspective of neo Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class  By the mid   th century  neo Confucianism was Japan s dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the kokugaku  national learning  school of thought  Advanced studies and growing applications of neo Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class  and large group oriented practices  The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the rule of law  New laws were developed  and new administrative devices were instituted  A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu  Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life  The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule  Government was all powerful but responsible and humane  Although the class system was influenced by neo Confucianism  it was not identical to it  Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model  in Japan  some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite  Members of the samurai class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar administrators  Another special way of life ch nind  also emerged  Ch nind    the way of the townspeople   was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as Osaka  Kyoto  and Edo  It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities diligence  honesty  honor  loyalty  and frugality while blending Shinto  neo Confucian  and Buddhist beliefs  Study of mathematics  astronomy  cartography  engineering  and medicine were also encouraged  Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship  especially in the arts  Buddhism and Shinto were both still important in Tokugawa Japan  Buddhism  together with neo Confucianism  provided standards of social behavior  Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past  Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes  Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in      when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple  The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han  villages  wards  and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments  Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community  Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity  Shinto eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo Confucian rationalism and materialism  The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems  Kokugaku contributed to the emperor centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the   th and   th centuries  The Kojiki  Nihon Shoki  and Man y sh  were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit  Some purists in the kokugaku movement  such as Motoori Norinaga  even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences in effect  foreign influences for contaminating Japan s ancient ways  Japan was the land of the kami and  as such  had a special destiny      During the period  Japan studied Western sciences and techniques  called rangaku   Dutch studies   through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in Dejima  The main areas that were studied included geography  medicine  natural sciences  astronomy  art  languages  physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena  and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches  or wadokei  inspired by Western techniques   Art  culture and entertainment edit   Red and White Plum Blossoms by Ogata K rin            In the field of art  the Rinpa school became popular  The paintings and crafts of the Rinpa school are characterized by highly decorative and showy designs using gold and silver leaves  bold compositions with simplified objects to be drawn  repeated patterns  and a playful spirit  Important figures in the Rinpa school include Hon ami K etsu  Tawaraya S tatsu  Ogata K rin  Sakai H itsu and Suzuki Kiitsu  Other than the Rinpa school  Maruyama  kyo and It  Jakuch  are famous for their realistic painting techniques  They produced their works under the patronage of wealthy merchants newly emerging from the economic development of this period  Following the Azuchi Momoyama period  the painters of the Kano school drew pictures on the walls and fusumas of castles and temples with the support of powerful people        The Great Wave off Kanagawa  full colour ukiyo e woodblock print  Hokusai  c            For the first time  urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture  Their search for enjoyment became known as ukiyo  the floating world   an ideal world of fashion  popular entertainment  and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life   This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries  many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara  The district was known for being the center of Edo s developing sense of elegance and refinement      Established in      as the city s shogunate sanctioned prostitution district  it kept this designation about     years  Yoshiwara was home to mostly women who  due to unfortunate circumstances  found themselves working in this secluded environment   Professional female entertainers  geisha   music  popular stories  Kabuki and bunraku  puppet theater   poetry  a rich literature  and art  exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints  known as ukiyo e   were all part of this flowering of culture  Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon             and the poet  essayist  and travel writer Matsuo Bash             Ukiyo e is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late   th century  at first depicting the entertainments of the pleasure districts of Edo  such as courtesans and kabuki actors  Harunobu produced the first full colour nishiki e prints in       a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo e   The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as Kiyonaga and Utamaro   As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated  warriors  nature  folklore  and the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige   The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo e as both old fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies   Ukiyo e was a primary part of the wave of Japonisme that swept Western art in the late   th century  The Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments  despite termination of contact with the outside world  and cultural maturation  especially in terms of theater  music  and other entertainment   For example  a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta ch  was invented during this time     and is still used today in folk songs   Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes  and different arts became more defined as this gap widened   Several different types of kabuki  theater  emerged   Some  such as shibaraku  were only available at a certain time of year  while some companies only performed for nobles   Fashion trends  satirization of local news stories  and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater  as well      The most popular sport was sumo  Eating out became popular due to urbanization  Particularly popular among ordinary people were stalls serving fast food such as soba  sushi  tempura  and unagi  tofu restaurants  teahouses and izakaya  Japanese style pubs   A number of ryotei also opened to serve high class food  People enjoyed eating at restaurants by buying books that listed restaurant ratings that imitated sumo rankings          Gardening were also popular pastimes for the people of the time  Especially in Edo  residences of daimyo  feudal lords  of each domain were gathered  and many gardeners existed to manage these gardens  which led to the development of horticultural techniques  Among people  cherry blossoms  morning glories  Japanese irises and chrysanthemums were especially popular  and bonsai using deep pots became popular  Not only did people buy plants and appreciate flowers  but they were also enthusiastic about improving the varieties of flowers  so specialized books were published one after another  For example  Matsudaira Sadatomo produced     varieties of iris and published a technical book      Traveling became popular among people because of the improvement of roads and post towns  The main destinations were famous temples and Shinto shrines around the country  and eating and drinking at the inns and prostitution were one of the main attractions  And what people admired most was the visit to Ise Grand Shrine and the summit of Mount Fuji  which are considered the most sacred places in Japan  The Ise Grand Shrine in particular has been visited by an enormous number of visitors  and historical documents record that      million people visited the shrine in    days in      and      million people visited it in three days in      when the grand festival held every    years  Shikinen Sengu  was held  It was a once in a lifetime event for people living in remote areas  so they set up a joint fund for each village  saved their travel expenses  and went on a group trip  Local residents of Ise Grand Shrine and Mount Fuji used to send specialized advertising personnel to various parts of Japan to solicit trips to local areas to make money from tourism             Art  culture    Ukiyo e based on kabuki actors became popular  Ichikawa Danj r  V in the popular kabuki play Shibaraku  by Utagawa Kunimasa             Ukiyo e

woman  uchikake              Khalili Collection of Kimono Clothing acquired a wide variety of designs and decorative techniques  especially for kimono worn by women      The main consumers of kimono were the samurai who used lavish clothing and other material luxuries to signal their place at the top of the social order      Driven by this demand  the textile industry grew and used increasingly sophisticated methods of weaving  dyeing  and embroidery      Over this period  women adopted brighter colours and bolder designs  whereas women s and men s kimono had been very similar      The rise of a merchant class fuelled more demand for elaborate costumes  While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home  luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men      A kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the goshodoki or  palace court style   which would be worn in the residence of a military leader  a Shogun or daimy    These would have landscape scenes  among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature      Samurai men would dress with a more understated design with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist      The yogi  or sleeping kimono  is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding  usually with simple designs      A style called tsuma moy  had rich decoration from the waist down only  and family emblems on the neck and shoulders  These would be worn by women of the merchant class      The kimono of merchant class women were more subdued than those of the samurai  but still with bold colours and designs representing nature      Red was a popular colour for wealthy women  partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion  and partly because the dye   derived from safflower       was very expensive  so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth      Indian fabrics  brought to Japan by Dutch importers  were received with enthusiasm and found many uses      Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns      Some garments used fabric imported from Britain or France  Ownership of these exotic textiles signified wealth and taste  but they were worn as undergarments where the designs would not be seen      Inro and netsuke became popular as accessories among men  Originally  inro was a portable case to put a seal or medicine  and netsuke was a fastener attached to the case  and both were practical tools  However  from the middle of the Edo period  products with high artistic value appeared and became popular as male accessories  Especially samurai and wealthy merchants competed to buy inro of high artistic value  At the end of the Edo period  the artistic value of inro further increased and it came to be regarded as an art collection             Fashion    Inro and Netsuke    th century       Ladies fashion in     s by Utagawa Toyokuni     End of the

Yasukuni Shrine     pound bronze  bore     mm  length      mm The end of this period is specifically called the late Tokugawa shogunate  The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan s opening to the world by Commodore Matthew Perry of the US Navy  whose armada  known by Japanese as  the black ships   fired weapons from Edo Bay  Several artificial land masses were created to block the range of the armada  and this land remains in what is presently called the Odaiba district  The Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures  Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the bakufu and a coalition of its critics  The continuity of the anti bakufu movement in the mid   th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa  Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was  poor management of the central government by the sh gun  which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart   attribution needed      From the outset  the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families  accumulation of wealth and fostered a  back to the soil  policy  in which the farmer  the ultimate producer  was the ideal person in society  The standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period  Better means of crop production  transport  housing  food  and entertainment were all available  as was more leisure time  at least for urban dwellers  The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society  by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was    percent   and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the samurai and ch nin classes  Despite the reappearance of guilds  economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds  and commerce spread and a money economy developed  Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society  the samurai  who gradually became separated from their rural ties  depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods  artistic interests  and loans  In this way  a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the ch nin took place  A struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the sh gun imposed on the entrepreneurial class  The government ideal of an agrarian society failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution  A huge government bureaucracy had evolved  which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order  Compounding the situation  the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period  Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain  there were at least    million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in       Drought  followed by crop shortages and starvation  resulted in twenty great famines between      and       During the Tokugawa period  there were     famines  of which    were widespread and serious      Peasant unrest grew  and by the late   th century  mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace  Newly landless families became tenant farmers  while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities  As the fortunes of previously well to do families declined  others moved in to accumulate land  and a new  wealthy farming class emerged  Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers  while others were left discontented  Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants  Although Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge  the rapid industrialization of the West during the   th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West  forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime  Western intrusions were on the increase in the early   th century  Russian warships and traders encroached on Karafuto  called Sakhalin under Russian and Soviet control  and on the Kuril Islands  the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of Hokkaid   A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in       and other warships and whalers were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the     s and     s  Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan s shores  Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings  they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out  sometimes using force  Rangaku became crucial not only in understanding the foreign  barbarians  but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off  By the     s  there was a general sense of crisis  Famines and natural disasters hit hard  and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in       Although it lasted only a day  the uprising made a dramatic impression  Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems  The sh gun s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit  more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts  suppression of rangaku  censorship of literature  and elimination of  luxury  in the government and samurai class  Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of sonn  j i  revere the emperor  expel the barbarians   which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions  The bakufu persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the First Opium War of            More reforms were ordered  especially in the economic sector  to strengthen Japan against the Western threat  Japan turned down a demand from the United States  which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia Pacific region  to establish diplomatic relations when Commodore James Biddle appeared in Edo Bay with two warships in July        End of seclusion edit   Matthew Calbraith Perry  Landing of Commodore Perry  Officers and Men of the Squadron To meet the Imperial Commissioners at Kurihama Yokosuka March  th       When Commodore Matthew C  Perry s four ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July       the bakufu was thrown into turmoil  The chairman of the senior councillors  Abe Masahiro              was responsible for dealing with the Americans  Having no precedent to manage this threat to national security  Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners  of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out  and of the daimy  who wanted to go to war  Lacking consensus  Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry s demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations  In March       the Treaty of Peace and Amity  or Treaty of Kanagawa  opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions  guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors  and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in Shimoda  a seaport on the Izu Peninsula  southwest of Edo  The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U S  and Japan  Harris Treaty   opening still more areas to American trade  was forced on the bakufu five years later  The resulting damage to the bakufu was significant  The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate  enormous effect      The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price      Along with this  cheap goods from these developed nations  like finished cotton  flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business      Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the bakufu  In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies  Abe  to the consternation of the fudai  had consulted with the shinpan and tozama daimy   further undermining the already weakened bakufu  In the Ansei Reform              Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses  In       a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki  and a Western style military school was established at Edo  by the next year  the government was translating Western books  Opposition to Abe increased within fudai circles  which opposed opening bakufu councils to tozama daimy   and he was replaced in      as chairman of the senior councilors by Hotta Masayoshi              At the head of the dissident faction was Tokugawa Nariaki  who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti foreign sentiments  and who had been put in charge of national defense in       The Mito school based on neo Confucian and Shinto principles had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution  the turning back of the West  and the founding of a world empire under the divine Yamato dynasty  In the final years of the Tokugawas  foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted  The new treaty with the United States in      allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives  unsupervised trade at four additional ports  and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo  It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality  foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law   Hotta lost the support of key daimy   and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty  Hotta sought imperial sanction  The court officials  perceiving the weakness of the bakufu  rejected Hotta s request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan s internal politics for the first time in many centuries  When the sh gun died without an heir  Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son  Tokugawa Yoshinobu  or Keiki   for sh gun  a candidate favored by the shinpan and tozama daimy   The fudai won the power struggle  however  installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi  arresting Nariaki and Keiki  executing Yoshida Sh in              a leading sonn  j i intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu   and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations  thus ending more than     years of exclusion  Recently when   some scholars who   have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan  From      to      Yoshimune  eighth Tokugawa sh gun from            started the first Ky h  reforms in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government      In       to      Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income      This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace      Similarly  Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the Kansei Reforms in           to stabilize rice prices  cut government costs  and increase revenues      The final economic reform of the Tenp  era of           had similar objectives  Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas  These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan  as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets  Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change  The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes  such as restoring the powers of the Emperor  This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko  a woman who farmed silkworms in the Ina Valley  from Hirata Atsutane s School of National Learning     It is disgusting the agitation over thread In today s world Ever since the ships from foreign countries came for the jeweled silkworm cocoons to the land of the gods and the Emperor Peoples hearts awesome though they are  are being pulled apart and consumed by rage         This inspired many anti Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor       Tokugawa Yoshinobu in later life

During the last years of the bakufu  or bakumatsu  the bakufu took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance  although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of anti Western sentiment throughout the country  The army and the navy were modernized  A naval training school was established in Nagasaki in       Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years  starting a tradition of foreign educated future leaders  such as Admiral Enomoto  French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals  such as Yokosuka and Nagasaki  By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in       the Japanese navy of the sh gun already possessed eight Western style steam warships around the flagship Kaiy  Maru  which were used against pro imperial forces during the Boshin War under the command of Admiral Enomoto  A French military mission was established to help modernize the armies of the bakufu  Revering the emperor as a symbol of unity  extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners  Foreign naval retaliation in the Anglo Satsuma War led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in       but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties  A bakufu army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the Satsuma and Ch sh  Domains in       Finally  in       Emperor K mei died and was succeeded by his underaged son Emperor Meiji  Tokugawa Yoshinobu reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and sh gun  He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the sh gun s leadership role  Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Ch sh  daimy   other daimy  called for returning the sh gun s political power to the emperor and a council of daimy  chaired by the former Tokugawa sh gun  Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late      and resigned  announcing an  imperial restoration   The Satsuma  Ch sh   and other han leaders and radical courtiers  however  rebelled  seized the imperial palace  and announced their own restoration on January          Following the Boshin War              the bakufu was abolished  and Yoshinobu
