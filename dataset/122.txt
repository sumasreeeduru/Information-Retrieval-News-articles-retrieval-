 is a sovereign country in South Asia  It is mainly in the Himalayas  but also includes parts of the Indo Gangetic Plain  It is the   th largest country by population and   rd largest country by area  It is landlocked  and borders China in the north and India in the south  east and west  while Bangladesh is located within only    km     mi  of its southeastern tip and Bhutan is separated from it by the Indian state of Sikkim  Nepal has a diverse geography  including fertile plains  subalpine forested hills  and eight of the world s ten tallest mountains  including Mount Everest  the highest point on Earth  Kathmandu is the capital and the largest city  Nepal is a multiethnic country  with Nepali as the official language  The name  Nepal  is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent  the era in ancient India when Hinduism was founded  the predominant religion of the country  In the middle of the first millennium BCE  Gautama Buddha  the founder of Buddhism  was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal  Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet  The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo Aryans  and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala  The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley s traders  The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture   By the   th century  the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal  The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire  under its Rana dynasty of premiers  The country was never colonized but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India  Parliamentary democracy was introduced in       but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs  in      and       The Nepalese Civil War in the     s and early     s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in       ending the world s last Hindu monarchy  The Constitution of Nepal  adopted in       affirms Nepal as a secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces  It remains the only multi party  fully democratic nation in the world ruled by a communist party  Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in       and friendship treaties were signed with India in      and the People s

as Nepal  a  The precise origin of the term Nep l is uncertain  Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC  However  an absolute chronology can not be established  as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period  Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history  and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo European and Tibeto Burman languages      According to Hindu mythology  Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne  referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi  According to Pashupati Pur na  as a place protected by Ne  the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nep l  b  According to Nep l Mah tmya  c  Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati      According to Buddhist mythology  Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it  As the cherished of Ne  the valley would be called Nep l      According to Gopalar jvamsh vali  the genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled circa     s  Nepal is named after Nepa the cowherd  the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras  In this account  the cow that issued milk to the spot  at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatin th upon investigation  was also named Ne      Norwegian indologist Christian Lassen had proposed that Nep la was a compound of Nipa  foot of a mountain  and  ala  short suffix for alaya meaning abode   and so Nep la meant  abode at the foot of the mountain   He considered Ne Muni to be a fabrication      Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen s theory untenable but had no theories of his own  only suggesting that either Newara is a vulgarism of sanskritic Nepala  or Nepala is Sanskritization of the local ethnic      his view has found some support though it does not answer the question of etymology                  It has also been proposed that Nepa is a Tibeto Burman stem consisting of Ne  cattle  and Pa  keeper   reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas  cowherds  and Mahispalas  buffalo herds       Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from Tibeto Burman roots   Ne  of uncertain meaning  as multiple possibilities exist   and pala or bal  whose meaning is lost entirely       History Main article  History of Nepal Ancient Nepal  This painting in a Laotian temple depicts a legend surrounding the birth of Gautam Buddha c      BCE in Lumbini of western Nepal  By        years ago  the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa  where they had earlier evolved              The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about        years ago      The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time      After      BCE  evidence for domestication of food crops and animals  construction of permanent structures  and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan      These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilization          the first urban culture in South Asia      Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic  mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district      The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley Civilization  It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent  around      BCE  inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto Burmans and Indo Aryans from across the border      By      BCE  the Tibeto Burmese people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north east India or both      Another possibility for the first people to have inhabited Nepal are the Kusunda people  According to Hogdson         the earliest inhabitants of Nepal were perhaps the Kusunda people  probably of proto Australoid origin      Stella Kramrisch        mentions a substratum of a race of pre Dravidians and Dravidians  who were in Nepal even before the Newars  who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu      By the late Vedic period  Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts  such as the late Vedic Atharvaveda Pari i  a and in the post Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad      The Gopal Bansa was the oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name  Nepal       The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over    centuries by some accounts      According to the Mahabharata  the then Kirata king went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra  In the south eastern region  Janakpurdham was the capital of the prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila  that extended down to the Ganges  and home to King Janaka and his daughter  Sita    In the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple  is a stone inscription dated     CE  the first in Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini  c      BCE   Around     BCE  small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal  From one of these  the Shakya polity  arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life  founded Buddhism  and came to be known as Gautama Buddha  traditionally dated         BCE       Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries  played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet      and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts  By     BCE  the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire  Emperor Ashoka made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha s birthplace  the inscriptions on which mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal      Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautam Buddha s visit there  By the  th century CE  much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire  d      In the Kathmandu valley  the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Lichchhavis  and the Lichchhavi dynasty came into power c      CE  The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions  Nepal s history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them          In      Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal  Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire      The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late  th century  and was followed by a Thakuri rule  Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the   th century CE  not much is known of this period that is often called the dark period       Medieval Nepal  Sinja Valley  thought to be the place of origin of the Khasas and the Nepali language  was at the heart of the Khas Malla empire  In the   th century  a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India  By the   th century  the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas  literally    states as they were counted  The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo China in the intervening centuries  their language  later renamed Nepali language  became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North east India      In south eastern Nepal  Simraungarh annexed Mithila around      CE  and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than     years      even ruling over Kathmandu for a time      After another     years of Muslim rule  Tirhut came under the control of the Sens of Makawanpur      In the eastern hills  a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal    Patan Durbar Square  one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley  was built by the Mallas in the   th century  The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development in Nepali art and architecture  In the Kathmandu valley  the Mallas  who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient times  had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by middle of the   th century  The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut  but established independent reign by late   th century as Tirhut went into decline  In the late   th century  Jayasthiti Malla introduced widespread socio economic reforms  principal of which was the caste system  By dividing the indigenous non Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four Varna system of Hinduism  he provided an influential model for the Sanskritization and Hinduization of the indigenous non Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal  By the middle of the   th century  Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which  according to Kirkpatrick  extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India      In the late   th century  Malla princes divided their kingdom in four   Kathmandu  Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east  The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal  and the building of famous Kathmandu  Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares  their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late   th century  and ultimately  unification of Nepal into a modern state          Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu in the early   th century  Nepal remain largely untouched by the Muslim invasion of India that began in the   th century  However  the Mughal period saw an influx of high caste Hindus from India into Nepal  They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the   th century  there were about    Rajput ruled principalities in Nepal  including the    baisi states and  to their east in west central Nepal     Chaubisi states  There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal  followed by British rule  Gorkha  one of the Baisi states  emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice  after it codified the first Hinduism based laws in the Nepalese hills       Unification  expansion and consolidation Main article  Kingdom of Nepal Clockwise from upper left   a  Prithvi Narayan Shah  b  An      map of the Indian subcontinent showing Nepal at its zenith  c  Balbhadra Kunwar  who  at age     commanded the defence of Nalapani fort against a superior British force  and after the enemy cutoff the water supply  charged out with    men  d  Jung Bahadur Rana  who established the autocratic Rana regime in      and instituted a pro British foreign policy In the mid   th century  Prithvi Narayan Shah  a Gorkha king  set out to put together what would become present day Nepal  He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms  After several bloody battles and sieges  notably the Battle of Kirtipur  he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in           The Gorkha control reached its height when the North Indian territories of the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control  A dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet forced the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north      Rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo Nepali War            At first  the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing  Thus began the reputation of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers  The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty  under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands          Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability  In       a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar  a fast rising military leader  This led to the Kot massacre  armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country  Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victorious and founded the Rana dynasty  and came to be known as Jung Bahadur Rana  The king was made a titular figure  and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary  The Ranas were staunchly pro British and assisted them during the Indian Rebellion of       and later in both World Wars   In      some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion  known as Naya Muluk  new country   In       the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of           The Hindu practice of Sati  in which a widow sacrificed herself in the funeral pyre of her husband  was banned in       and slavery was officially abolished in           Rana rule was marked by tyranny  debauchery  economic exploitation and religious persecution            Nepal after       Lakhan Thapa  the first commoner to speak out against any Nepali regime  was hanged for it by the Ranas in       and is considered the first Martyr of Nepal  In the late     s  newly emerging pro democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy  Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in  with India s support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan  Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime  establishing a parliamentary democracy  After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government  King Mahendra  ruled            scrapped the democratic experiment in       and a  partyless  Panchayat system was created to govern Nepal  The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled      Ram Baran Yadav became the first President of the Nepali republic on    July       after the monarchy was finally abolished following its decades long tussle with democracy  The Panchayat rule modernised the country  introducing reforms and developing infrastructure  but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy censorship  In       the People s Movement forced King Birendra  ruled            to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy          In       the Maoist Party started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people s republic      This led to the long Nepali Civil War and more than        deaths      With the death of both the King and the Crown Prince in a massacre in the royal palace  King Birendra s brother Gyanendra inherited the throne in          and subsequently assumed full executive powers aiming to quash the Maoist insurgency himself      The Maoist Party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful democratic revolution of           Nepal became a secular state      and on    May       it was declared a republic      ending its time honoured status as the world s only Hindu Kingdom      The country s new designation as the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal was submitted to the United Nations on   August           and later confirmed by the constitution  After a decade of instability and internal strife which saw two constituent assembly elections  the new constitution was promulgated on    September       making Nepal a federal democratic republic divided into seven provinces            Geography Main articles  Geography of Nepal and Geology of Nepal  A topographic map of Nepal  Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape  about     kilometres      mi  long and     kilometres      mi  wide  with an area of         km          sq mi   It lies between latitudes     and    N  and longitudes     and    E  Nepal s defining geological processes began    million years ago when the Indian plate  then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana  began a north eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south west  and later  south and south east      Simultaneously  the vast Tethyn oceanic crust  to its northeast  began to subduct under the Eurasian plate      These dual processes  driven by convection in the Earth s mantle  both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas      The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes  which only broke through as late as         years ago  creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley  In the western region  rivers which were too strong to be hampered  cut some of the world s deepest gorges      Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas  plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river borne sediment     and now constitutes the Indo Gangetic Plain      Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone  occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc  nearly one third of the       km        mi  long Himalayas                          with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau        Mount Everest  the highest peak on earth  lies on the Nepal China border  Nepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as Himal Pahad Terai  e  Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range  it makes up the northern part of Nepal  It contains the highest elevations in the world including       metres         ft  height Mount Everest  Sagarm th  in Nepali  on the border with China  Seven other of the world s  eight thousanders  are in Nepal or on its border with China  Lhotse  Makalu  Cho Oyu  Kangchenjunga  Dhaulagiri  Annapurna and Manaslu  Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow  The mountains vary from     to       metres        to        ft  in altitude  with progression from subtropical climates below       metres        ft  to alpine climates above       metres         ft   The Lower Himalayan Range  reaching       to       metres        to       ft   is the southern limit of this region  with subtropical river valleys and  hills  alternating to the north of this range  Population density is high in valleys but notably less above       metres        ft  and very low above       metres        ft   where snow occasionally falls in winter  The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo Gangetic Plain  Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges  The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers  the Koshi  the Narayani  and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline  This region has subtropical to tropical climate  The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range  cresting at     to       metres        to       ft   marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain  however broad  low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys  Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka  lie north of these foothills in several places    K ppen climate classification for Nepal The Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about    mm      in  per year      This makes Nepal an earthquake prone zone  and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences present a significant hurdle to development  Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment  which flows to the Indian Ocean      Saptakoshi  in particular  carries huge amount of silt out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in Bihar  causing severe floods and course changes  and is therefore  known as the sorrow of Bihar  Severe flooding and landslides cause deaths and disease  destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of the country  during the monsoon season each year  Nepal has five climatic zones  broadly corresponding to the altitudes  The tropical and subtropical zones lie below       metres        ft   the temperate zone

expected to eradicate poverty within    years            The agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable as it is highly dependent on the monsoon rains  with just     of the arable land being irrigated  As of      update        Agriculture employs     of the workforce  services      and manufacturing and craft based industry          Private investment  consumption  tourism and agriculture

UNESCO world heritage sites Lumbini  Sagarmatha National Park  home to Mount Everest   seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one  and Chitwan National Park  Most of Nepal s mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest  which is more accessible from the Nepalese side  Nepal  officially opened to westerners in       became a popular destination at the end of the hippie

termed the  infrastructure bottleneck   the flag carrier in shambles  and a handful of destinations properly developed and marketed  The home stay tourism  in which cultural and eco tourists stay as paying guests in the homes of indigenous people  has seen some success        Foreign employment  While adults are employed in slavery like conditions abroad  hundreds of thousands of children in the country are employed as child labour  not including the agricultural sector   The rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working age population       driving millions to seek employment abroad  mainly in India  the Gulf  and East Asia  Mostly unskilled  uneducated  and indebted to loan sharks  these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war ridden countries under fraudulent contracts            They have their passports seized  to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts  Most do not get paid minimum wage       and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages       Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions  an average of two workers die each day       Due to restrictions placed on women  many depend on traffickers to get out of the country  and end up victims of violence and abuse       Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery like conditions  and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers  on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead  and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries            Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty  due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills  the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption             Infrastructure Energy  Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Dam  Nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower  which it plans to export across South Asia The bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass       and imported fossil fuels             Most of the final energy consumption goes to the residential sector       followed by transport      and industry       the transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years       Except for some lignite deposits  Nepal has no known oil  gas or coal deposits       All commercial fossil fuels  mainly oil  LPG and coal  are imported  spending      of the country s total export revenue       Only about    of the energy need is fulfilled by electricity       The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country s topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects  Estimates put Nepal s economically feasible hydro power potential at approximately        MW       However  Nepal has been able to exploit only about       MW  As most of it is generated from run of river  ROR  plants  the actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as       MW  and Nepal needs to import as much as     MW from India to meet the demands       Major hydro power projects suffer delays and setbacks                 Nepal s electrification rate       is comparable to that of other countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural       and urban       areas        The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs  high system losses  high generation costs  high overheads  over staffing  and lower domestic demand        Transportation Nepal remains isolated from the world s major land  air and sea transport routes  although  within the country  aviation is in a better state  with    airports     of them with paved runways       flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic  The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive  As of      update   there were just over        km        mi  of paved roads         km         mi  of unpaved roads  and just    km     mi  of railway line in the south       As of      update   all district headquarters  except Simikot  had been connected to the road network       Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season  even national highways regularly become inoperable       Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from countries like China  India and Japan  for building  maintenance and expansion of the road network  The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India  The national carrier  Nepal Airlines  is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption  and has been blacklisted by the EU       Internally  the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets  schools  and health clinics a challenge        Communication According to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August      report  voice telephony subscription rate was

Culture of Nepal  A Magar couple in their ethnic dress  Society Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy  The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia  Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups  often termed as j tis  or  castes   Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in           and has since enacted other anti discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives  At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal  caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance  Family values are important in the Nepali tradition  and multi generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal  though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas  An overwhelming majority of Nepalis  with or without their consent  have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders  Marriage is thought to be for life  and the divorce rate is extremely low  with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce       Child marriages are common  especially in rural areas  many women

metal and wood craftsmanship  has survived at least four major earthquakes       Pagodas  now an indispensable part of East Asian architecture  are conjectured to have been transmitted to China from Nepal   b  Nepali stonecraft in a community water spout  c  A traditional Newar  Ankhijhyal  window in the form of a peacock The oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south western Nepal  and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley c      BCE  The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period  A Tang dynasty Chinese travel book  probably based on records from c      CE  describes contemporary Nepali architecture  predominantly built with wood  as rich in artistry  as well as wood and metal sculpture  It describes a magnificent seven storied pagoda in the middle of a palace  with copper tiled roofs  its balustrade  grills  columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones  and four golden sculptures of Makaras in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain  supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower  Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal s king s palace as an immense structure with many roofs  suggesting that Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture  which has now become one of the chief characteristic of Chinese architecture  A typical pagoda temple is built with wood  every piece of it finely carved with geometrical patterns or images of gods  goddesses  mythical beings and beasts  The roofs usually tiled with clay  and sometimes gold plated  diminish in proportion successively until the topmost roof is reached which is itself ensigned by a golden finial  The base is usually composed of rectangular terraces of finely carved stone  the entrance is usually guarded by stone sculptures of conventional figures  Bronze and copper craftsmanship observable in the sculpture of deities and beasts  decorations of doors and windows and the finials of buildings  as well as items of every day use is found to be of equal splendour  The most well developed of Nepali painting traditions is the thanka or paubha painting tradition of Tibetan Buddhism  practised in Nepal by the Buddhist monks and Newar artisans  Changu Narayan Temple  built c   th century CE has probably the finest of Nepali woodcraft  the Kathmandu  Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares are the culmination of Nepali art and architecture  showcasing Nepali wood  metal and stone craftsmanship refined over two millennia       The  ankhijhyal  window  that allow a one way view of the outside world  is an example of unique Nepali woodcraft  found in building structures  domestic and public alike  ancient and modern  Many cultures paint the walls of their homes with regular patterns  figures of gods and beasts and religious symbols  others paint their walls plain  often with clay or chernozem contrasted with yellow soil or limestone  The roofs of religious as well as domestic structures project considerably  presumably to provide protection from the sun and the rain  The timber of domestic structures are finely carved as with their religious counterparts        Literature and the performing arts Main articles  Nepalese literature  Music of Nepal  and Cinema of Nepal Nepal s literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom  Literary works  which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi  included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings  gods and demons       The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the   th century but except for the epigraphic material  Nepali language literature older than the   th century haven t been found  However  Newar literature dates back almost     years       The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya              who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali  the language accessible to the masses  most prominently  the Bhanubhakta Ramayana  a translation of the ancient Hindu epic       By the end of the nineteenth century  Motiram Bhatta had published print editions of the works of Acharya  and through his efforts  single handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity       By the mid twentieth century  Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions  Influenced by western literary traditions  writers in this period started producing literary works addressing the contemporary social problems       while many others continued to enrich Nepali poetic traditions with authentic Nepali poetry  Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition  After the advent of democracy in       Nepali literature flourished  Literary works in many other languages began to be produced  Nepali literature continued to modernise  and in recent years  has been strongly influenced by the post civil war Nepali experience as well as global literary traditions                      Maruni  Lakhey  Sakela  Kauda and Tamang Selo are some examples of the traditional Nepali music and dance in the hilly regions of Nepal  Nepali film industry is known as  Kollywood        Nepal Academy is the foremost institution for the promotion of arts and culture in Nepal  established in             Clothing  A Nepali man in Daura Suruwal  coat and Dhaka topi  displays the bhoto during the Bhoto Jatra festival  The most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal  for both women and men  from ancient times until the advent of modern times  was draped       For women  it eventually took the form of a sari  a single long piece of cloth  famously six yards long  and of width spanning the lower body       The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end  wrapped around the lower body  and then over the shoulder       In its more modern form  it has been used to cover the head  and sometimes the face  as a veil       particularly in the Terai  It has been combined with an underskirt  or the petticoat  and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening  It is worn with a blouse  or cholo  which serves as the primary upper body garment  the sari s end  passing over the shoulder  now serving to obscure the upper body s contours  and to cover the midriff       Cholo sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions  official environs and festive gatherings  In its more traditional form  as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour  it takes the form of a fariya or gunyu  usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth  and all of it wrapped around the lower body  For men  a similar but shorter length of cloth  the dhoti  has served as a lower body garment       It too is tied around the waist and wrapped       Among the Aryans  it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back  Dhoti or its variants  usually worn over a langauti  constitute the lower body garment in the traditional clothing of Tharus  Gurungs and Magars as well as the Madhesi people  among others  Other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are the Patukas  a length of cloth wrapped tightly over the waist by both sexes as a waistband  a part of most traditional Nepali costumes  usually with a Khukuri tucked into it when worn by men   scarves like Pachhyauras and majetros and shawls like the Newar Ga and Tibetan khata  Ghumtos  the wedding veils  and various kinds of turbans  scarves worn around the head as a part of a tradition  or to keep off the sun or the cold       called a Pheta  Pagri or Sirpau   Until the beginning of the first millennium CE  the ordinary dress of people in South Asia was entirely unstitched       The arrival of the Kushans from Central Asia  circa    CE  popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asia       The simplest form of sewn clothing  Bhoto  a rudimentary vest   is a universal unisex clothing for children  and traditionally the only clothing children wear until they come of age and are given adult garb  sometimes in a ceremonial rite of passage  such as the gunyu choli ceremony for Hindu girls  Men continue to wear bhoto through adulthood  Upper body garment for men is usually a vest such as the bhoto  or a shirt similar to the Kurta  such as Daura  a closed necked double breasted long shirt with five pleats and eight strings that serve to tie it around the body  Suruwal  simply translated as a pair of trousers  is an alternative to and  more recently  replacement for dhoti  kachhad  Magars  or Lungi  Tharus   it is traditionally much wider above the knees but tapers below  to fit tightly at the ankles  and is tied to the waist with a drawstring  Modern cholos worn with sarees are usually half sleeved and single breasted  and do not cover the midriff  The traditional one called the chaubandi cholo  like the daura  is full sleeved  double breasted with pleats and strings  and extends down to the patuka  covering the midriff  Daura Suruwal and Gunyu Cholo were the national dresses for men and women respectively until      when they were removed to eliminate favouritism       Traditional dresses of many pahari ethnic groups are Daura Suruwal or similar  with patuka  a dhaka topi and a coat for men  and Gunyu cholo or similar  with patuka and sometimes a scarf for women  For many other groups  men s traditional dresses consist of a shirt or a vest  paired with a dhoti  kachhad or lungi  In the high himalayas  the traditional dresses are largely influenced by Tibetan culture  Sherpa women wear the chuba with the pangi apron  while Sherpa men wear shirts with stiff high collar and long sleeves called tetung under the chuba  Tibetan Xamo Gyaise hats of the Sherpas  dhaka topi of pahari men and tamang round caps are among the more distinctive headwears  Married Hindu women wear tika  sindur  pote and red bangles  Jewellery of gold and silver  and sometimes precious stones  are common  Gold jewellery includes Mangalsutras and tilaharis worn with the pote by the Hindus  Samyafung  a huge gold flower worn on the head  and Nessey  huge flattened gold earrings  worn by the Limbus  and Sirphuli  Sirbandhi and Chandra worn by the Magars  Tharu women can wear as much as six kilograms of silver in jewellery  which includes Mangiya worn on the head  tikuli the forehead  and kanseri and tikahamala around the neck       In the last    years  fashions have changed a great deal in Nepal  Increasingly  in urban settings  the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear  transformed instead into one for formal occasions  The traditional kurta suruwal is rarely worn by younger women  who increasingly favour jeans  The dhoti has largely been reduced to the liturgical vestment of shamans and Hindu priests   Cuisine Main article  Nepalese cuisine  A dal bhat thali with boiled rice  lentil soup  fried leafy greens  vegetable curry  yoghurt  papad and vegetable salad Nepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines  Given the range of diversity in soil type  climate  culture  ethnic groups  and occupations  these cuisines vary substantially from each other  using locally available spices  herbs  vegetables  and fruit       The Columbian exchange had brought the potato  the tomato  maize  peanuts  cashew nuts  pineapples  guavas  and most notably  chilli peppers  to South Asia  Each became staples of use       The cereals grown in Nepal  their choice  times  and regions of planting  correspond strongly to the timing of Nepal s monsoons       and the variations in altitude  Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well irrigated valleys  and maize  millet  barley and buckwheat in the lesser fertile and drier hills            The foundation of a typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion  and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes       The latter includes lentils  pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic  but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander  cumin  turmeric  cinnamon  cardamon  jimbu and others as informed by culinary conventions       In an actual meal  this mental representation takes the form of a platter  or thali  with a central place for the cooked cereal  peripheral ones  often in small bowls  for the flavourful accompaniments  and the simultaneous  rather than piecemeal  ingestion of the two in each act of eating  whether by actual mixing for example of rice and lentils or in the folding of one such as bread around the other  such as cooked vegetables       Dal bhat  centred around steamed rice is the most common example       as well as dairy and sometimes meat  is the most common and prominent example  The unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called chapati occasionally replaces the steamed rice  particularly in the Terai  while Dhindo  prepared by boiling corn  millet or buckwheat flour in water  continuously stirring and adding flour until thick  almost solid consistency is reached  is the main substitute in the hills and mountains  Tsampa  flour made from roasted barley or naked barley  is the main staple in the high himalayas  Throughout Nepal  fermented  then sun dried  leafy greens called Gundruk  are both a delicacy and a vital substitute for fresh vegetables in the winter         Momo dumplings with chutney A notable feature of Nepali food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines  each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents       The appearance of ahimsa  or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in South Asian history  especially Upanishadic Hinduism  Buddhism and Jainism  is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of Nepal s Hindu and Buddhist populations  as well as among Jains       Among these groups  strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat       Though per capita meat consumption is low in Nepal  the proportion of vegetarianism is not high as in India  due to the prevalence of Shaktism  of which animal sacrifice is a prominent feature         Samayabaji  Newar cuisine  Nepali cuisines possess their own distinctive qualities to distinguish these hybrid cuisines from both their northern and southern neighbours            Nepali cuisines  with generally tomato based  leaner curries  are lighter than their cream based Indian counterparts  and Nepali momo dumplings are heavily spiced compared to their northern counterparts       Newar cuisine  one of the richest and most influential in Nepal  is more elaborate and diverse than most  as Newar culture developed in the highly fertile and prosperous Kathmandu valley       A typical Newar cuisine can comprise more than a dozen dishes of cereals  meat  vegetable curries  chutneys and pickles  Kwanti  sprouted beans soup   chhwela  ground beef   chatamari   rice flour crepe   bara  fried lentil cake   kachila  marinated raw minced beef   samaybaji  centred around flattened rice   lakhaamari and yomuri are among the more widely recognised            Juju dhau  a sweet yoghurt originating in Bhaktapur  is also famous       Thakali cuisine is another well known food tradition which seamlessly melds the Tibetan and the Indian with variety in ingredients  especially the herbs and spices       In the Terai  Bagiya is a rice flour dumpling with sweets inside  popular among the Tharu and Maithil people  Various communities in the Terai make sidhara  sun dried small fish mixed with taro leaves  and biriya  lentil paste mixed with taro leaves  to stock for the monsoon floods       Selroti  kasaar  fini and chaku are among the sweet delicacies  Rice pulau or sweet rice porridge called kheer are usually the main dish in feasts       Tea and buttermilk  fermented milk leftover from churning butter from yoghurt  are common non alcoholic drinks  Almost all janajati communities have their own traditional methods of brewing alcohol  Raksi  traditional distilled alcohol   jaand

the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as        years ago to as late as        years ago  although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations  Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation  spreading into each habitable land they encountered  One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean  Eventually  various bands entered India between        years ago and        years ago  page         Petraglia
