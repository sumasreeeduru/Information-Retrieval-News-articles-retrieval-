independent journalists and presenters  while moving towards  right leaning punditry  in prime time      Drawing a strong comparison to Fox News  the network began moving towards panel based programming from       with many of its highest profile prime time commentators conservative          Hosts Andrew Bolt and Paul Murray have been compared to Fox News presenters Bill O Reilly and Sean Hannity respectively      Academics note Sky News also featuring  centre left  commentators and  respected independent journalists  as a key distinction to Fox News      However  since the changes implemented in       Sky News has not been nominated for any television or journalism awards  an area where it had historically performed well      In August       Sky News was heavily criticised for providing a platform to Blair Cottrell  leader of the Neo Nazi organisation United Patriots Front in a one on one discussion about immigration on The Adam Giles Show  Sky News presenters  including Laura Jayes and David Speers  were among those critical  both on air and off air  of his appearance on the program due to the fact that he has expressed admiration for Hitler and claimed to have manipulated women  using violence and terror           Sky News commentator and former Labor Party minister Craig Emerson resigned in protest after the interview was broadcast  stating that  My father fought Nazis in WWII and was interred in a German POW camp   and that the decision to give Cottrell a platform on Sky News was  another step in a journey to normalising racism   bigotry in our country       Activist groups called on advertisers to pull advertising campaigns off Sky News in the wake of the channel s interview with Cottrell      During the fallout and criticism over the interview  Cottrell responded by tweeting about raping reporter Laura Jayes  saying via Twitter that  I might as well have raped  ljayes  Laura Jayes  on the air  not only would she have been happier with that but the reaction would ve been the same   Jayes responded by stating that Cottrell is  not just a fascist  He s down right dangerous       In November       Sky News terminated the contract of former Liberal Party MP and late night presenter Ross Cameron for using racist language to describe Chinese people      In the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in March       Sky News Australia
