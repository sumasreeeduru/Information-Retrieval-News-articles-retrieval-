        time zone map A time zone is a region of the globe that observes a uniform standard time for legal  commercial and social purposes  Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions instead of strictly following longitude because it is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time  France  including its overseas territories  has the most time zones of any country  with a total of     Most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time  UTC  by a whole number of hours  UTC       to UTC         but a few zones are offset by    or    minutes  e g  Newfoundland Standard Time is UTC        Nepal Standard Time is UTC        Indian Standard Time is UTC       and Myanmar Standard Time is UTC         Some higher latitude and temperate zone countries use daylight saving time for part of the year  typically by adjusting local clock time by an hour  Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding nautical time zones  This also creates  permanent daylight saving time effect   Contents    History      Railway time     Worldwide time zones     Notation of time      ISO

began to use local mean solar time  Apparent and mean solar time can differ by up to around    minutes  as described by the equation of time  because of the elliptical shape of the Earth s orbit around the Sun  eccentricity  and the tilt of the Earth s axis  obliquity   Mean solar time has days of equal length  and the accumulated difference between the two sums to zero after a year  Greenwich Mean Time  GMT  was established in       when the Royal Observatory was built  as an aid to mariners to determine longitude at sea  providing a standard reference time while each city in England kept a different local time   Railway time edit  Main article  Railway time  Plaque commemorating the Railway General Time Convention of      in North America Local solar time became increasingly inconvenient as rail transport and telecommunications improved  because clocks differed between places by amounts corresponding to the differences in their geographical longitudes  which varied by four minutes of time for every degree of longitude  For example  Bristol  England is about     degrees west of Greenwich  East London   so when it is solar noon in Bristol  it is about    minutes past solar noon in London     The use of time zones accumulates these differences into longer units  usually hours  so that nearby places can share a common standard for timekeeping  The first adoption of a standard time was in November       in Great Britain by railway companies using GMT kept by portable chronometers  The first of these companies to adopt standard time was the Great Western Railway  GWR  in November       This quickly became known as Railway Time  About August           time signals were first transmitted by telegraph from the Royal Observatory  Greenwich  Even though     of Great Britain s public clocks were using GMT by       it was not made Britain s legal time until August          Some British clocks from this period have two minute hands one for the local time  one for GMT     Improvements in worldwide communication further increased the need for interacting parties to communicate mutually comprehensible time references to one another  The problem of differing local times could be solved across larger areas by synchronizing clocks worldwide  but in many places that adopted time would then differ markedly from the solar time to which people were accustomed  On November          the then British colony of New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed throughout the colony  and was the first country to do so     It was based on the longitude         East of Greenwich  that is    hours    minutes ahead of GMT  This standard was known as New Zealand Mean Time     Timekeeping on the American railroads in the mid   th century was somewhat confused  Each railroad used its own standard time  usually based on the local time of its headquarters or most important terminus  and the railroad s train schedules were published using its own time  Some junctions served by several railroads had a clock for each railroad  each showing a different time            time zone map of the United States  showing boundaries very different from today Charles F  Dowd proposed a system of one hour standard time zones for American railroads about       although he published nothing on the matter at that time and did not consult railroad officials until       In      he proposed four ideal time zones  having north south borders   the first centered on Washington  D C   but by      the first was centered on the meridian     W of Greenwich  with geographic borders  for example  sections of the Appalachian Mountains   Dowd s system was never accepted by American railroads  Instead  U S  and Canadian railroads implemented a version proposed by William F  Allen  the editor of the Traveler s Official Railway Guide     The borders of its time zones ran through railroad stations  often in major cities  For example  the border between its Eastern and Central time zones ran through Detroit  Buffalo  Pittsburgh  Atlanta  and Charleston  It was inaugurated on Sunday  November           also called  The Day of Two Noons      when each railroad station clock was reset as standard time noon was reached within each time zone  The zones were named Intercolonial  Eastern  Central  Mountain  and Pacific  Within a year     of all cities with populations over         about     cities  were using standard time     A notable exception was Detroit  which is about halfway between the meridians of eastern time and central time  which kept local time until       then tried Central Standard Time  local mean time  and Eastern Standard Time before a May      ordinance settled on EST and was ratified by popular vote in August       The confusion of times came to an end when Standard zone time was formally adopted by the U S  Congress in the Standard Time Act of March            Worldwide time zones edit  The first known person to conceive of a worldwide system of time zones was the Italian mathematician Quirico Filopanti  He introduced the idea in his book Miranda  published in       He proposed    hourly time zones  which he called  longitudinal days   the first centred on the meridian of Rome  He also proposed a universal time to be used in astronomy and telegraphy  But his book attracted no attention until long after his death          Scottish born Canadian Sir Sandford Fleming proposed a worldwide system of time zones in       He advocated his system at several international conferences  and is credited with  the initial effort that led to the adoption of the present time meridians       In       his first proposal was for a global    hour clock  conceptually located at the centre of the Earth and not linked to any surface meridian  In      he specified that his universal day would begin at the anti meridian of Greenwich     th meridian   while conceding that hourly time zones might have some limited local use  He also proposed his system at the International Meridian Conference in October       but it did not adopt his time zones because they were not within its purview  The conference did adopt a universal day of    hours beginning at Greenwich midnight  but specified that it  shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable       By about       almost all inhabited places on Earth had adopted one or other standard time zone  but only some of these used an hourly offset from GMT  Many applied the time at a local astronomical observatory to an entire country  without any reference to GMT  It took many decades before all time zones were based on some  standard offset  from GMT UTC  By       the majority of countries had adopted hourly time zones  though a number of countries from Iran to Australia had time zones with a    minute offset  Nepal was the last country to adopt a standard offset  shifting slightly to UTC      in           Today  all nations use standard time zones for secular purposes  but they do not all apply the concept as originally conceived  Newfoundland  India  Iran  Afghanistan  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  the Marquesas  as well as parts of Australia use half hour deviations from standard time  and some nations  such as Nepal  and some provinces  such as the Chatham Islands of New Zealand  use quarter hour deviations  Some countries  such as China and India  use a single time zone even though the extent of their territory far exceeds     of longitude  which causes problems as some places in China  like Xinjiang  westernmost province of China   uses local time and when planning to meet with the Chinese living in Beijing  a very eastern city  they will have trouble understanding each other as they are two hours apart      Russia is traditionally divided into    time zones  but in      the number was reduced to nine      Then President Dmitry Medvedev said at the time that he would like to see even fewer in place      In       the two removed time zones were reinstated  making the number of time zones    again        Notation of time edit  ISO      edit  Main article  ISO      ISO      is an international standard that defines methods of representing dates and times in textual form  including specifications for representing time zones       UTC edit  If a time is in Coordinated Universal Time  UTC   a  Z  is added directly after the time without a separating space   Z  is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset         UTC  is therefore represented as       Z  or      Z   Likewise            UTC  is written as          Z  or        Z       UTC time is also known as  Zulu  time  since  Zulu  is a phonetic alphabet code word for the letter  Z        Offsets from UTC edit  Offsets from UTC are written in the format   hh   mm     hh  mm   or   hh   either hours ahead or behind UTC   For example  if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC  such as the time in Berlin during the winter   the zone designator would be                    or simply        This numeric representation of time zones is appended to local times in the same way that alphabetic time zone abbreviations  or  Z   as above  are appended  The offset from UTC changes with daylight saving time  e g  a time offset in Chicago  which is in the North American Central Time Zone  is          for the winter  Central Standard Time  and          for the summer  Central Daylight Time        Abbreviations edit  Main article  List of time zone abbreviations This section does not cite any

relationship   time in zone A     UTC offset for zone A     time in zone B     UTC offset for zone B   in which each side of the equation is equivalent to UTC   The more familiar term  UTC offset  is used here rather than the term  zone designator  used by the standard   The conversion equation can be rearranged to   time in zone B     time in zone A     UTC offset for zone A     UTC offset for zone B   For example  the New York Stock Exchange opens at        EST  UTC offset          In Los Angeles  PST  UTC offset          and Delhi  IST  UTC offset           the New York Stock Exchange

because the UTC offset for zone X is a function of the UTC time   The table  Time of day by zone  gives an overview on the time relations between different zones   Nautical type edit  Main article  Nautical time Since the     s a nautical standard time system has been in operation for ships on the high seas  Nautical time zones are an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system  Under the system  a time change of one hour is required for each change of longitude by      The     gore that is offset from GMT or UT   not UTC  by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two      gores that differ from GMT by     hours  A nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps  It follows the    th meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land  forming gaps  it is a pole to pole dashed line              A ship within the territorial waters of any nation would use that nation s standard time  but would revert to nautical standard time upon leaving its territorial waters  The captain is permitted to change the ship s clocks at a time of the captain s choice following the ship s entry into another time zone  The captain often chooses midnight  Ships going in shuttle traffic over a time zone border often keep the same time zone all the time  to avoid confusion about work  meal  and shop opening hours  Still the time table for port calls must follow the land time zone   Skewing of zones edit   Difference between sun time and clock time during daylight saving time       h      min behind      h     m

time of a particular meridian located in the middle of that zone with boundaries located     degrees east and west of the meridian  In practice  zone boundaries are often drawn much farther to the west with often irregular boundaries  and some locations base their time on meridians located far to the east  For example  even though the Prime Meridian      passes through Spain and France  they use the mean solar time of    degrees east  Central European Time  rather than   degrees  Greenwich Mean Time   France previously used GMT  but was switched to CET  Central European Time  during the German occupation of the country during World War II and did not switch back after the war      Similarly  prior to World War II  the Netherlands observed  Amsterdam Time   which was twenty minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time  They were obliged to follow German time during the war  and kept it thereafter  In the mid     s the Netherlands  as with other European states  began observing daylight saving  summer  time  In the Northern hemisphere  there is a tendency to draw time zone boundaries far to the west of their meridians  A reason is that it can allow the more efficient use of sunlight      citation needed  Another reason for this is that similar working day schedules around the world have led to people rising on average at       clock time and going to bed at       clock time  This means that the middle of the period that people are awake   awake time noon   occurs at                      clock time  whereas   if using as clock time the time of the nautical time zone to which the location concerned geographically belongs   solar noon occurs at               min  clock time  To make solar noon coincide more with awake time noon  i e  make the sun reach its highest point closer to       clock time rather than       clock time   the time of one or even two nautical time zones to the east is chosen  Many of these locations also use DST  adding yet another nautical time zone to the east  As a result  note    in summer  solar noon in the Spanish town of Mux a occurs at       clock time  indeed very close to awake time noon          This westernmost area of continental Spain never experiences sunset before       clock time  even in midwinter  despite its lying more than    degrees north of the equator  Near the summer solstice  Mux a has sunset times  after        similar to those of Stockholm  which is in the same time zone and    degrees farther north  Stockholm has much earlier sunrises  though  A more extreme example is Nome  Alaska  which is at        W longitude just west of center of the idealized Samoa Time Zone      W   Nevertheless  Nome observes Alaska Time      W  with DST so it is slightly more than two hours ahead of the sun in winter and over three in summer      Kotzebue  Alaska  also near the same meridian but north of the Arctic Circle  has an annual event on August   to celebrate two sunsets in the same    hour day  one shortly after midnight at the start of the day  and the other shortly before midnight at the end of the day  Also  China extends as far west as    E  but all parts of it use UTC            E   so solar  noon  can occur as late as       in western portions of China such as Xinjiang and Tibet  citation needed  The Afghanistan China border marks the greatest terrestrial time zone difference on Earth  with a     hour difference between Afghanistan s UTC      and China s UTC         Daylight saving time edit  Main article  Daylight saving time Many countries  and sometimes just certain regions of countries  adopt daylight saving time  also known as  Summer Time   during part of the year  This typically involves advancing clocks by an hour near the start of spring and adjusting back in autumn   spring forward    fall back    Modern DST was first proposed in      and was in widespread use in      as a wartime measure aimed at conserving coal  Despite controversy  many countries have used it off and on since then  details vary by location and change occasionally  Most countries around the equator do not observe daylight saving time  since the seasonal difference in sunlight is minimal   Computer systems and the Internet edit  Many computer operating systems include the necessary support for working with all  or almost all  possible local times based on the various time zones  Internally  operating systems typically use UTC as their basic time keeping standard  while providing services for converting local times to and from UTC  and also the ability to automatically change local time conversions at the start and end of daylight saving time in the various time zones   See the article on daylight saving time for more details on this aspect   Web servers presenting web pages primarily for an audience in a single time zone or a limited range of time zones typically show times as a local time  perhaps with UTC time in brackets  More internationally oriented websites may show times in UTC only or using an arbitrary time zone  For example  the international English language version of CNN includes GMT and Hong Kong Time      whereas the US version shows Eastern Time      US Eastern Time and Pacific Time are also used fairly commonly on many US based English language websites with global readership  The format is typically based in the W C Note  datetime   Email systems and other messaging systems  IRC chat  etc       time stamp messages using UTC  or else include the sender s time zone as part of the message  allowing the receiving program to display the message s date and time of sending in the recipient s local time  Database records that include a time stamp typically use UTC  especially when the database is part of a system that spans multiple time zones  The use of local time for time stamping records is not recommended for time zones that implement daylight saving time because once a year there is a one hour period when local times are ambiguous  Calendar systems nowadays usually tie their time stamps to UTC  and show them differently on computers that are in different time zones  That works when having telephone or internet meetings  It works less well when travelling  because the calendar events are assumed to take place in the time zone the computer or smartphone was on when creating the event  The event can be shown at the wrong time  For example  if a New Yorker plans to meet someone in Los Angeles at   AM  and makes a calendar entry at   AM  which the computer assumes is New York time   the calendar entry will be at   AM if taking the computer s time zone  There is also an option in newer versions of Microsoft Outlook to enter the time zone in which an event will happen  but often not in other calendar systems  Calendaring software must also deal with daylight saving time  DST   If  for political reasons  the begin and end dates of daylight saving time are changed  calendar entries should stay the same in local time  even though they may shift in UTC time  In Microsoft Outlook  time stamps are therefore stored and communicated without DST offsets      Hence  an appointment in London at noon in the summer will be represented as        UTC        even though the event will actually take place at       UTC  In Google Calendar  calendar events are stored in UTC  although shown in local time  and might be changed by a time zone changes      although normal daylight saving start and end are compensated for  similar to much other calendar software    Operating systems edit  This section

that have elapsed since          Coordinated Universal Time  UTC  on Thursday  January              By default the external representation is as UTC  Coordinated Universal Time   though individual processes can specify time zones using the TZ environment variable      This allows users in multiple time zones to use the same computer  with their respective local times displayed correctly to each user  Time zone information most commonly comes from the IANA time zone database  In fact  many systems  including anything using the GNU C Library  can make use of this database   Microsoft Windows edit  Windows based computer systems prior to Windows      used local time  but Windows      and later can use UTC as the basic system time      The system registry contains time zone information that includes the offset from UTC and rules that indicate the start and end dates for daylight saving in each zone  Interaction with the user normally uses local time  and application software is able to calculate the time in various zones  Terminal Servers allow remote computers to redirect their time zone settings to the Terminal Server so that users see the correct time for their time zone in their desktop application sessions  Terminal Services uses the server base time on the Terminal Server and the client time zone information to calculate the time in the session   Programming languages edit  Java edit  While most application software will use the underlying operating system for time zone information  the Java Platform  from version        has maintained its own time zone database  This database is updated whenever time zone rules change  Oracle provides an updater tool for this purpose      As an alternative to the time zone information bundled with the Java Platform  programmers may choose to use the Joda Time library      This library includes its own time zone data based on the IANA time zone database      As of Java   there is a new date and time API that can help with converting time zones  Java   Date Time  JavaScript edit  Traditionally  there was very little in the way of time zone support for JavaScript  Essentially the programmer had to extract the UTC offset by instantiating a time object  getting a GMT time from it  and differencing the two  This does not provide a solution for more complex daylight saving variations  such as divergent DST directions between northern and southern hemispheres  ECMA      the standard on Internationalization API for JavaScript  provides ways of formatting Time Zones      However  due to size constraint  some implementations or distributions do not include it       Perl edit  The DateTime object in Perl supports all time zones in the Olson DB and includes the ability to get  set and convert between time zones       PHP edit  The DateTime objects and related functions have been compiled into the PHP core since      This includes the ability to get and set the default script time zone  and DateTime is aware of its own time zone internally  PHP net provides extensive documentation on this      As noted there  the most current time zone database can be implemented via the PECL timezonedb   Python edit  The standard module datetime included with Python stores and operates on the time zone information class tzinfo  The third party pytz module provides access to the full IANA time zone database      Negated time zone offset in seconds is stored time timezone and time altzone attributes   Smalltalk edit  Each Smalltalk dialect comes with its own built in classes for dates  times and timestamps  only a few of which implement the DateAndTime and Duration classes as specified by the ANSI Smalltalk Standard  VisualWorks provides a TimeZone class that supports up to two annually recurring offset transitions  which are assumed to apply to all years  same behavior as Windows time zones   Squeak provides a Timezone class that does not support any offset transitions  Dolphin Smalltalk does not support time zones at all  For full support of the tz database  zoneinfo  in a Smalltalk application  including support for any number of annually recurring offset transitions  and support for different intra year offset transition rules in different years  the third party  open source  ANSI Smalltalk compliant Chronos Date Time Library is available for use with any of the following Smalltalk dialects  VisualWorks  Squeak  Gemstone  or Dolphin       Time zones in outer space edit  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding

sunrises and sunsets in a    hour period  or in the case of Apollo program astronauts travelling to the moon  none  Thus it is not possible to calibrate time zones with respect to the sun  and still respect a    hour sleep wake cycle  A common practice for space exploration is to use the Earth based time zone of the launch site or mission control  This keeps the sleeping cycles of the crew and controllers in sync  The International Space Station normally uses Greenwich Mean Time  GMT           Timekeeping on Mars can be more complex  since the planet has a solar day of approximately    hours and    minutes  known as a sol  Earth controllers for some Mars missions have synchronized their sleep wake cycles with the Martian day      because solar powered rover activity on the surface was tied to periods of light and dark  The difference in day length caused the sleep wake cycles to slowly drift with respect to the day night cycles on Earth  repeating approximately once every    days   See also edit   The control panel of the Time Zone Clock in front of Coventry Transport Museum  Daylight saving time ISO      Lists of time zones Time in Europe Metric time Time by country
