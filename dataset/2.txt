portal Category  Journalismvte Advocacy journalism is a genre of journalism that adopts a non objective viewpoint  usually for some social or political purpose  Some advocacy journalists reject that the traditional ideal of objectivity is possible in practice  either generally  or due to the presence of corporate sponsors in advertising   Some feel that the public interest is better served by a diversity of media outlets with a variety of transparent points of view  or that advocacy journalism serves a similar role to muckrakers or whistleblowers   Contents    Perspectives from advocacy

collaborative  the Independent Media Center  wrote the following in a      call to action   Classic tenets of journalism call for objectivity and neutrality  These are antiquated principles no longer universally observed     We must absolutely not feel bound by them  If we are ever to create meaningful change  advocacy journalism will be the single most crucial element to enable the necessary organizing  It is therefore very important that we learn how to be successful advocacy journalists  For many  this will require a different way of identifying and pursuing goals     In an April      address to the Canadian Association of Journalists  Sue Careless gave the following commentary and advice to advocacy journalists  which seeks to establish a common view of what journalistic standards the genre should follow      Acknowledge your perspective up front  Be truthful  accurate  and credible   Don t spread propaganda  don t take quotes or facts out of context   don t fabricate or falsify   and  don t judge or suppress vital facts or present half truths  Don t give your opponents equal time  but don t ignore them  either  Explore arguments that challenge your perspective  and report embarrassing facts that support the opposition   Ask critical questions of people who agree with you  Avoid slogans  ranting  and polemics   Instead   articulate complex issues clearly and carefully   Be fair and thorough  Make use of neutral sources to establish facts  Sue Careless also criticized the mainstream media for unbalanced and politically biased coverage  for economic conflicts of interest  and for neglecting certain public causes     She said that alternative publications have advantages in independence  focus  and access  which make them more effective public interest advocates than the mainstream media      History edit  This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it   June        An image of The Crisis publication  an example of alternative and advocacy media American context edit  Nineteenth century American newspapers were often partisan  publishing content that conveyed the opinions of journalists and editors alike     These papers were often used to promote political ideologies and were partisan to certain parties or groups  The Crisis  the official magazine of the NAACP  was founded in       It described itself as inheriting the tradition of advocacy journalism from Freedom s Journal     which began in      as  the first African American owned and operated newspaper published in the United States      The Suffragist newspaper  founded in      by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage  promoted the agenda of the National Woman s Party and was considered the only female political newspaper at the time     Muckrakers are often claimed as the professional ancestors of modern advocacy journalists  for example  Ida M  Tarbell  Ida B  Wells  Nellie Bly  Lincoln Steffens  Upton Sinclair  George Seldes  and I F  Stone   Objectivity edit  Further information  Journalistic objectivity  Objectivity  philosophy   and View from nowhere Advocacy journalists may reject the principle of objectivity in their work for several different reasons  Studies have shown that despite efforts to remain completely impartial  journalism is unable to escape some degree of implicit bias  whether political  personal  or metaphysical  whether intentional or subconscious  citation needed  This does not necessarily indicate an outright rejection of the existence of an objective reality  but rather recognition of the inability to report on it in a value free fashion and the controversial nature of objectivity in journalism  Many journalists and scholars accept the philosophical idea of pure  objectivity  as being impossible to achieve     page needed  but still strive to minimize bias in their work  It is also argued that as objectivity is an impossible standard to satisfy  all types of journalism have some degree of advocacy  whether are intentional or not      See also edit    Journalism portal Environmental journalism Journalism ethics and standards Journalistic interventionism News propaganda Science
