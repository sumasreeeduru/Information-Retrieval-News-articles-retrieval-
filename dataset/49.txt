island country in South Asia  located in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal and southeast of the Arabian Sea  Sri Lanka has been called  the pearl of the Indian ocean  because of its shape and location      It is geographically separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait  Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital  and Colombo is its largest city and centre of commerce  Sri Lanka s documented history spans       years  with evidence of prehistoric human settlements dating back at least         years      It has a rich cultural heritage  and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka  the P li Canon  date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in    BCE          Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to the modern Maritime Silk Road              Its location as a major trading hub made it known to both the far East as well as the European continent from as far back as the Anuradhapura period  The country s trade in luxury goods and spices attracted traders of many nations  creating Sri Lanka s diverse population  During a period of great political crisis  the Portuguese  whose arrival in Sri Lanka was largely accidental  sought to control the island s maritime regions and its lucrative external trade  The Portuguese possessions were later taken over by the Dutch  The Dutch possessions were then taken by the British  who later extended their control over the whole island  colonising it from      to       Resistance to the British was immediate  A national movement for political independence arose in the early   th century  and in       Ceylon became a republic and adopted its current name in       Sri Lanka s recent history has been marred by a    year civil war  which ended decisively when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in           Sri Lanka s current constitution stipulates it as a republic and unitary state governed by a semi presidential system  It has had a long history of international engagement  as a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation  SAARC   and a member of the United Nations  the Commonwealth of Nations  the G    and the Non Aligned Movement  Sri Lanka is rated  high  on the Human Development Index  HDI   with its HDI rating and per capita income the highest among South Asian nations      The Sri Lankan constitution accords Buddhism the  foremost place   and although it does not identify it as a state religion  Buddhism is given special privileges in the Sri Lankan constitution      Sri Lanka is home to many cultures  languages and ethnicities  The majority of the population are from the Sinhalese ethnicity  while a large minority of Tamils have also played an influential role in the island s history  Moors  Burghers  Malays  Chinese  and the indigenous Vedda are also established

Toponymy Main article  Names of Sri Lanka In antiquity  Sri Lanka was known to travellers by a variety of names  According to the Mahavamsa  the legendary Prince Vijaya named the land Tambapanni   copper red hands  or  copper red earth    because his followers  hands were reddened by the red soil of the area          In Hindu mythology  such as the Ramayana  the island was referred to as Lank    Island    The Tamil term Eelam  Tamil        romanized    am  was used to designate the whole island in Sangam literature          The island was known under Chola rule as Mummudi Cholamandalam   realm of the three crowned Cholas        Ancient Greek geographers called it Taproban   Ancient Greek             or Taproban                  from the word Tambapanni  The Persians and Arabs referred to it as Sarand b  the origin of the word  serendipity   from Sanskrit Si haladv pa           Ceil o  the name given to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese Empire when it arrived in           was transliterated into English as Ceylon      As a British crown colony  the island was known as Ceylon  it achieved independence as the Dominion of Ceylon in       The country is now known in Sinhala as  r  La k   Sinhala              and in Tamil as Ila kai  Tamil          IPA   i la  a     In       its formal name was changed to  Free  Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka   Later  on   September       it was changed to the  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka           As the name Ceylon still appears in the names of a number of organisations  the Sri Lankan government announced in      a plan to rename all those over which it has authority       History Main article  History of Sri Lanka Prehistoric Sri Lanka Main article  Prehistory of Sri Lanka The pre history of Sri Lanka goes back         years and possibly even as far back as         years      The era spans the Palaeolithic  Mesolithic  and early Iron Ages  Among the Paleolithic human settlements discovered in Sri Lanka  Pahiyangala  named after the Chinese traveller monk Faxian   which dates back to        BP      Batadombalena         BP      and Belilena         BP  are the most important  In these caves  archaeologists have found the remains of anatomically modern humans which they have named Balangoda Man  and other evidence     suggesting that they may have engaged in agriculture and kept domestic dogs for driving game      During the protohistoric period           BCE  Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India      and shared the same megalithic burials  pottery  iron technology  farming techniques and megalithic graffiti          This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the Velir  prior to the migration of Prakrit speakers              One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian epic Ramayana  which provides details of a kingdom named Lanka that was created by the divine sculptor Vishwakarma for Kubera  the Lord of Wealth      It is said that Kubera was overthrown by his demon stepbrother Ravana  the powerful emperor who built a mythical flying machine named Dandu Monara      The modern city of Wariyapola is described as Ravana s airport      Early inhabitants of Sri Lanka were probably ancestors of the Vedda people      an indigenous people numbering approximately       living in modern day Sri Lanka  The   th century Irish historian James Emerson Tennent theorised that Galle  a city in southern Sri Lanka  was the ancient seaport of Tarshish from which King Solomon is said to have drawn ivory  peacocks  and other valuables   Ancient Sri Lanka Main articles  Pre Anuradhapura period and Anuradhapura period  Ptolemy s world map of Ceylon  first century CE  in a      publication According to the Mah vamsa  a Sinhalese chronicle written in P  i  the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are said to be the Yakshas and Nagas  Ancient cemeteries that were used before     BCE and other signs of advanced civilisation have also been discovered in Sri Lanka      Sinhalese history traditionally starts in     BCE with the arrival of Prince Vijaya  a semi legendary prince who sailed with     followers to Sri Lanka  after being expelled from Vanga Kingdom  present day Bengal       He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni  near modern day Mannar  Vijaya  Singha  is the first of the approximately     monarchs of Sri Lanka described in chronicles such as the Dipavamsa  Mah va sa  C  ava sa  and R j valiya        The Avukana Buddha statue  a    metre tall     ft  standing Buddha statue from the reign of Dhatusena of Anuradhapura   th century The Anuradhapura period      BCE        CE  began with the establishment of the Anuradhapura Kingdom in     BCE during the reign of Pandukabhaya  Thereafter  Anuradhapura served as the capital city of the country for nearly       years      Ancient Sri Lankans excelled at building certain types of structures such as tanks  dagobas and palaces      Society underwent a major transformation during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa  with the arrival of Buddhism from India  In     BCE      Mahinda  a bhikkhu and the son of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka arrived in Mihintale carrying the message of Buddhism      His mission won over the monarch  who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the Sinhalese population      Succeeding kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain many Buddhist schools and monasteries and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in Southeast Asia  Sri Lankan Bhikkhus studied in India s famous ancient Buddhist University of Nalanda  which was destroyed by Bakhtiyar Khilji  It is probable that many of the scriptures from Nalanda are preserved in Sri Lanka s many monasteries and that the written form of the Tripi aka  including Sinhalese Buddhist literature  were part of the University of Nalanda      In     BCE  bhikkhuni Sanghamitta arrived with the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree  which is considered to be a sapling from the historical Bodhi Tree under which Gautama Buddha became enlightened      It is considered the oldest human planted tree  with a continuous historical record  in the world   Bodhivamsa      Sri Lanka experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of Suratissa  who was defeated by two horse traders named Sena and Guttika from South India      The next invasion came immediately in     BCE by a Chola named Elara  who overthrew Asela and ruled the country for    years  Dutugamunu  the eldest son of the southern regional sub king  Kavan Tissa  defeated Elara in the Battle of Vijithapura  During its two and a half millennia of existence  the Sinhala Kingdom was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South Indian dynasties such as the Chola  Pandya  Chera  and Pallava  These invaders were all subsequently driven back      There also were incursions by the kingdoms of Kalinga  modern Odisha  and from the Malay Peninsula as well    The Sigiriya rock fortress The Fourth Buddhist Council of Theravada Buddhism was held at the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya in Sri Lanka under the patronage of Valagamba of Anuradhapura in    BCE  The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in Sri Lanka were particularly poor and many Buddhist monks subsequently died of starvation  Because the P li Canon was at that time oral literature maintained in several recensions by dhammabh  akas  dharma reciters   the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died  the teachings would not be lost      After the council  palm leaf manuscripts containing the completed Canon were taken to other countries such as Burma  Thailand  Cambodia and Laos  Sri Lanka was the first Asian country known to have a female ruler  Anula of Anuradhapura  r        BCE       Sri Lankan monarchs undertook some remarkable construction projects such as Sigiriya  the so called  Fortress in the Sky   built during the reign of Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura  who ruled between     and      The Sigiriya rock fortress is surrounded by an extensive network of ramparts and moats  Inside this protective enclosure were gardens  ponds  pavilions  palaces and other structures          In     CE  the invasion of Chola emperor Rajaraja I forced the then Sinhalese ruler Mahinda V to flee to the southern part of Sri Lanka  Taking advantage of this situation  Rajendra I  son of Rajaraja I  launched a large invasion in       Mahinda V was captured and taken to India  and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura causing the fall of Anuradhapura Kingdom  Subsequently  they moved the capital to Polonnaruwa       Post classical Sri Lanka Main articles  Polonnaruwa period and Transitional period of Sri Lanka Following a seventeen year long campaign  Vijayabahu I successfully drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in       reuniting the country for the first time in over a century          Upon his request  ordained monks were sent from Burma to Sri Lanka to re establish Buddhism  which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign      During the medieval period  Sri Lanka was divided into three sub territories  namely Ruhunu  Pihiti and Maya        A Buddhist statue in the ancient capital city of Polonnaruwa    th century Sri Lanka s irrigation system was extensively expanded during the reign of Par kramab hu the Great                  This period is considered as a time when Sri Lanka was at the height of its power          He built       reservoirs   the highest number by any ruler in Sri Lanka s history   repaired     dams        canals      major reservoirs  and       mini reservoirs      His most famous construction is the Parakrama Samudra      the largest irrigation project of medieval Sri Lanka  Par kramab hu s reign is memorable for two major campaigns   in the south of India as part of a Pandyan war of succession  and a punitive strike against the kings of Ramanna  Burma  for various perceived insults to Sri Lanka      After his demise  Sri Lanka gradually decayed in power  In       Kalinga Magha  an invader with uncertain origins  identified as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom  invaded and captured the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa  He sailed from Kalinga         nautical miles on     large ships with a        strong army  Unlike previous invaders  he looted  ransacked  and destroyed everything in the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms beyond recovery      His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of Rajarata as possible  His reign saw the massive migration of native Sinhalese people to the south and west of Sri Lanka  and into the mountainous interior  in a bid to escape his power          Sri Lanka never really recovered from the impact of Kalinga Magha s invasion  King Vijayab hu III  who led the resistance  brought the kingdom to Dambadeniya  The north  in the meanwhile  eventually evolved into the Jaffna kingdom          The Jaffna kingdom never came under the rule of any kingdom of the south except on one occasion  in       following the conquest led by king Par kramab hu VI s adopted son  Prince Sapumal      He ruled the North from      to      CE      The next three centuries starting from      were marked by kaleidoscopically shifting collections of capitals in south and central Sri Lanka  including Dambadeniya  Yapahuwa  Gampola  Raigama  Kotte      Sitawaka  and finally  Kandy  Chinese admiral Zheng He and his naval expeditionary force landed at Galle  Sri Lanka in      and got into battle with

written in three languages  Chinese  Tamil  and Persian   to commemorate his visit          The stele was discovered by S  H  Thomlin at Galle in      and is now preserved in the Colombo National Museum   Early Modern Sri Lanka Main article  Kandyan period See also  Portuguese Ceylon  Dutch Ceylon  and British Ceylon period  A   th century engraving of Dutch explorer Joris van Spilbergen meeting with King Vimaladharmasuriya in      The early modern period of Sri Lanka begins with the arrival of Portuguese soldier and explorer Louren o de Almeida  the son of Francisco de Almeida  in           In       the Portuguese built a fort at the port city of Colombo and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas  In       after decades of intermittent warfare with the Portuguese  Vimaladharmasuriya I moved his kingdom to the inland city of Kandy  a location he thought more secure from attack      In       succumbing to attacks by the Portuguese  the independent existence of the Jaffna kingdom came to an end      During the reign of the Rajasinha II  Dutch explorers arrived on the island  In       the king signed a treaty with the Dutch East India Company to get rid of the Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas      The following Dutch Portuguese War resulted in a Dutch victory  with Colombo falling into Dutch hands by       The Dutch remained in the areas they had captured  thereby violating the treaty they had signed in       The Burgher people  a distinct ethnic group  emerged as a result of intermingling between the Dutch and native Sri Lankans in this period      The Kingdom of Kandy was the last independent monarchy of Sri Lanka      In       Vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred Tooth Relic   the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the Sinhalese   to Kandy  and built the Temple of the Tooth      In spite of on going intermittent warfare with Europeans  the kingdom survived  Later  a crisis of succession emerged in Kandy upon king Vira Narendrasinha s death in       He was married to a Telugu speaking Nayakkar princess from South India  Madurai  and was childless by her      Eventually  with the support of bhikku Weliwita Sarankara  the crown passed to the brother of one of Narendrasinha s princesses  overlooking the right of  Unambuwe Bandara   Narendrasinha s own son by a Sinhalese concubine      The new king was crowned Sri Vijaya Rajasinha later that year  Kings of the Nayakkar dynasty launched several attacks on Dutch controlled areas  which proved to be unsuccessful        Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of Kandy  the last ruling Sri Lankan monarch During the Napoleonic Wars  fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Sri Lanka to the French  Great Britain occupied the coastal areas of the island  which they called Ceylon  with little difficulty in            Two years later  in       Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha  third of the four Nayakkar kings of Sri Lanka  died of a fever  Following his death  a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha  eighteen year old Kannasamy  was crowned       The young king  now named Sri Vikrama Rajasinha  faced a British invasion in      but successfully retaliated  The First Kandyan War ended in a stalemate       By then the entire coastal area was under the British East India Company as a result of the Treaty of Amiens  On    February       Kandy was occupied by the British in the second Kandyan War  ending Sri Lanka s independence       Sri Vikrama Rajasinha  the last native monarch of Sri Lanka  was exiled to India       The Kandyan Convention formally ceded the entire country to the British Empire  Attempts by Sri Lankan noblemen to undermine British power in      during the Uva Rebellion were thwarted by Governor Robert Brownrigg       The beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the Colebrooke Cameron reforms of            They introduced a utilitarian and liberal political culture to the country based on the rule of law and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government       An executive council and a legislative council were established  later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature  By this time  experiments with coffee plantations were largely successful       Soon  coffee became the primary commodity export of Sri Lanka  Falling coffee prices as a result of the depression of      stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms  dogs  shops  boats  etc   and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya  requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent       These harsh measures antagonised the locals  and another rebellion broke out in            A devastating leaf disease  Hemileia vastatrix  struck the coffee plantations in       destroying the entire industry within fifteen years       The British quickly found a replacement  abandoning coffee  they began cultivating tea instead  Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades  Large scale rubber plantations began in the early   th century    British appointed Kandyan chiefs       By the end of the   th century  a new educated social class transcending race and caste arose through British attempts to staff the Ceylon Civil Service and the legal  educational  engineering  and medical professions with natives       New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the Ceylon Legislative Council on a communal basis  Buddhist and Hindu revivalism reacted against Christian missionary activities            The first two decades in the   th century are noted by the unique harmony among Sinhalese and Tamil political leadership  which has since been lost       In       major Sinhalese and Tamil political organisations united to form the Ceylon National Congress  under the leadership of Ponnambalam Arunachalam       pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms  But without massive popular support  and with the governor s encouragement for  communal representation  by creating a  Colombo seat  that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils  the Congress lost momentum towards the mid     s       The Donoughmore reforms of      repudiated the communal representation and introduced universal adult franchise  the franchise stood at    before the reforms   This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership  who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created State Council of Ceylon  which succeeded the legislative council            In       Tamil leader G  G  Ponnambalam demanded a       representation      for the Sinhalese and     for other ethnic groups  in the State Council  However  this demand was not met by the Soulbury reforms of           Contemporary Sri Lanka Main article  History of Sri Lanka       present  See also  Sri Lankan independence movement and Sri Lankan Civil War  The formal ceremony marking the start of self rule  with the opening of the first parliament at Independence Square The Soulbury constitution ushered in dominion status  with independence proclaimed on   February            D  S  Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon       Prominent Tamil leaders including Ponnambalam and Arunachalam Mahadeva joined his cabinet            The British Royal Navy remained stationed at Trincomalee until       A countrywide popular demonstration against withdrawal of the rice rations resulted in the resignation of prime minister Dudley Senanayake       S  W  R  D  Bandaranaike was elected prime minister in       His three year rule had a profound impact through his self proclaimed role of  defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture        He introduced the controversial Sinhala Only Act  recognising Sinhala as the only official language of the government  Although partially reversed in       the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community  which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture                 The Federal Party  FP  launched a movement of non violent resistance  satyagraha  against the bill  which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement  Bandaranaike Chelvanayakam Pact  with S  J  V  Chelvanayakam  leader of the FP  to resolve the looming ethnic conflict       The pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy  The bill  together with various government colonisation schemes  contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders       Bandaranaike was assassinated by an extremist Buddhist monk in            Sirimavo Bandaranaike  the widow of Bandaranaike  took office as prime minister in       and withstood an attempted coup d  tat in       During her second term as prime minister  the government instituted socialist economic policies  strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China  while promoting a policy of non alignment  In       Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection  which was quickly suppressed  In       the country became a republic named Sri Lanka  repudiating its dominion status  Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the     s       The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment  which was in essence an affirmative action to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education       resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy            The assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah in      by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  LTTE  marked a crisis point            The government of J  R  Jayawardene swept to power in       defeating the largely unpopular United Front government       Jayawardene introduced a new constitution  together with a free market economy and a powerful executive presidency modelled after that of France  It made Sri Lanka the first South Asian country to liberalise its economy       Beginning in       ethnic tensions were manifested in an on and off insurgency against the government by the LTTE  An LTTE attack on    soldiers resulted in the anti Tamil race riots in July       allegedly backed by Sinhalese hard line ministers  which resulted in more than         Tamil civilians fleeing the island  seeking asylum in other countries            Lapses in foreign policy resulted in India strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training                 In       the Indo Sri Lanka Accord was signed and the Indian Peace Keeping Force  IPKF  was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to stabilise the region by neutralising the LTTE       The same year  the JVP launched its second insurrection in Southern Sri Lanka       necessitating redeployment of the IPKF in            In October       the LTTE expelled Sri Lankan Moors  Muslims by religion  from northern Sri Lanka       In       the Sri Lankan government and LTTE signed a Norwegian mediated ceasefire agreement       The      Asian tsunami killed over        in Sri Lanka       From      to       the Sri Lankan government and Tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success  Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in       and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in            In       under the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa  the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the LTTE and re established control of the entire country by the Sri Lankan Government       Overall  between        and         people were killed during the    years of conflict             Geography Main article  Geography of Sri Lanka

monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal  The  wet zone  and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to       millimetres       in  of rain each year  but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain  Most of the east  southeast  and northern parts of Sri Lanka comprise the  dry zone   which receives between       and       mm     and
