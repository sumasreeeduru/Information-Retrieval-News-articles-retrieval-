References   External links   History edit  The Anadolu Agency was founded in      during the Turkish War of Independence  Journalist Yunus Nadi Abal o lu and writer Halide Edip  fleeing the occupied capital  met in Geyve and concluded that a new Turkish press agency was needed  The agency was officially launched on April             days before the Turkish Grand National Assembly convened for the first time  It announced the first legislation passed by the Assembly  which established the Republic of Turkey     Since the Justice and Development Party  AKP  took power  AA and the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation  TRT  were both restructured to more closely reflect the government line  This tighter degree of government control over AA and TRT  along with increasing government influence over private media  has contributed to the formation of a hegemonic  dominant party system in Turkey  According to a      academic article   these public news producers  especially during the most recent term of the AKP government  have been controlled by officials from a small network close to the party leadership       See also edit  List of news agencies References edit     Syria
