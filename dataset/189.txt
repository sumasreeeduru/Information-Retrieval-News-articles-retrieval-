the archive of the BBC and from external producers  The channel was launched as part of the initial creation of the UKTV network  following the success of sister channel UK Gold  The channels success was noted when new channel UK Food was created with the sole purpose to free up the space on UK Style s schedule by transferring all food programming to the new channel  In January       another new channel called UK Bright Ideas was created to showcase programming from UK Style and UK Food on the digital terrestrial network Freeview  This was later extended to all networks  allowing repeats of some programmes to air on this channel only  On   March       in line with the rest of the UKTV network  the channel changed its name to UKTV Style  The channel s schedule was further freed up by the creation of new channel UKTV Style Gardens in January       which allowed the transfer of all landscape and gardening programmes to the new channel  The channel name was later shortened to UKTV Gardens in       As part of the rebranding of UKTV s channels to unique names and identities  UKTV Style was rebranded as Home on    April      and repositioned to include programming based around home improvement  gardens and home lifestyle programmes     Other female lifestyle programmes were transferred to newly created channel Really  and all gardening programmes were transferred from UKTV Gardens to Home as part of the rebrand  On   April       it was announced that UKTV co owner Discovery Inc  would acquire the BBC s stake in Home     In June       Discovery announced that Home would be rebranded as a local version of HGTV     This took place on    January       the first programme to air on HGTV was Homes Under The Hammer at   am   Timeshift service edit  The channel has a one hour timeshifted service called HGTV     This was formerly named Home    and before that  UKTV Style     The service broadcasts the same content as the main channel  only one hour later  A two hour timeshift called UKTV Style    was launched on    December      on major platforms  replacing UKTV Bright Ideas on Sky  This channel closed on    September      to make room for new entertainment channel Watch   On air identity edit   UKTV Style logo The channel s original identity revolved around the screen split in half horizontally with two objects coming together to form one object  Examples of these idents include an ornament added on top of a flower and still retains that image  wine pouring into a glass  with the base of glass formed out of pouring paint from a tin and a boater hat forming the bowl for some strawberries and cream  These idents were accompanied by a logo consisting of  UK  inside a box and the channel name  Style  written after on a line in upper case  The channel also had a digital on screen graphic  DOG  of the same logo     During July       the channel relaunched in image along with the rest of the UKTV network  The box and line logos were replaced with the channel name stylised UK Style with a four box pattern positioned to the right of the logo  This style had been adopted by the majority of the UKTV channels  with each channel s symbol representing the idents simplified and the channel focus in some ways  The boxes were arranged with one rectangle down the left hand side  one running along the top half of the screen  a third in the centre bottom and a fourth in the bottom right corner  This arrangement was also reflected in the relaunched idents in       with a different image in each section of the four part arrangement     The idents were changed again in January       with the same pattern used again  This time the pattern would appear integrated within the neutrally coloured home space  occasionally in shades of red and yellow  The pattern against the logo was also changed to shades of red and yellow at this time     With the rebrand to UKTV Style  the idents changed to a neutrally coloured house interior and occupiers  which when looked through a mirror is improved and brightly coloured  This was however replaced in      to a stream of purple moving across the screen  In both cases  the double lined UKTV Style logo would be aligned to the left of the screen  Then in       the idents were changed to a new set featuring people painting or dancing in front of the purple background while their silhouette opens up showing pictures of various lifestyles before it closes back  followed by the UKTV Style logo  The channel also adopted purple as the channel s colour at the same time  and three different shades of the colour would appear at the ending of promotions for programmes on the channel and for promotions for the channel on the UKTV network itself    Home logoFollowing the rebrand to Home  the idents now feature a virtual tour of a home of varying sorts  with various features pointed out by text  usually of a comical nature  These include identifying the pet cat as   th Flatmate   dirt on the floor as  Old carpet  new mud   a carpet as a  trip hazard   some old suitcases as the  DVD cabinet  and an ornament having  survived   moves and   extensions   The home logo outside of the circle then forms up over the centre of the scene     Scenes from homes are also used in promotion graphics and  stings  which show the channel name during advert breaks        Home was rebranded as HGTV on    January           Programming edit  The output of the channel shows lifestyle programmes  mainly gardening  home improvements and DIY shows  that are a combination of internally produced shows  repeats of shows from the BBC archive and international imports  Notable shows include      Minute Makeover A Place by the Sea A Place in the Sun  Home or Away  A Place in the Sun Antiques Roadshow
