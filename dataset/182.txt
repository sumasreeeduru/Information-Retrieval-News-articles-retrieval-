Journalismvte Churnalism is a pejorative term for a form of journalism in which press releases  stories provided by news agencies  and other forms of pre packaged material  instead of reported news  are used to create articles in newspapers and other news media  It is a portmanteau of  churn  and  journalism      Its purpose is to reduce cost by reducing original news gathering and checking sources     to counter revenue lost with the rise of Internet news and decline in advertising  there was a particularly steep fall from late          The origin of the word has been credited to BBC journalist Waseem Zakir  Churnalism has increased to the point that many stories found in the press are not original     The decline of original journalism has been associated with a corresponding rise in public relations      Contents    Prevalence   Economic causes   Speed   Combating churnalism   See also   References   External links   Prevalence edit  In his book Flat Earth News     the British journalist Nick Davies reported a study at Cardiff University by Professor Justin Lewis and a team of researchers    which found that     of the stories in Britain s quality press were not original and that only     of stories were generated by reporters      The result is a reduction of quality and accuracy  as the articles are open to manipulation and distortion  The journalist Waseem Zakir has been credited for coining the term churnalism while working for the BBC in          however  Zakir himself recollects it being a decade earlier      According to Zakir  the trend towards this form of journalism involves reporters becoming more reactive and less proactive in searching for news    You get copy coming in on the wires and reporters churn it out  processing stuff and maybe adding the odd local quote   It s affecting every newsroom in the country and reporters are becoming churnalists      An editorial on the matter in the British Journalism Review saw this trend as terminal for current journalism      a harbinger of the end of news journalism as we know it  the coroner s verdict can be nothing other than suicide        Others  such as Peter Preston  former editor of The Guardian  see the issue as over wrought  saying that there was never a golden age of journalism in which journalists were not subject to such pressures      Nick Davies and Roy Greenslade gave evidence on the matter to the Culture  Media and Sport Committee in           Churnalism does not only occur in newspapers  for example  Chris Anderson s wide use of  writethroughs  in his book Free  The Future of a Radical Price has been labelled churnalism       Economic causes edit  Traditional newspapers have cut staff as their advertising revenue has declined because of competition from other media such as television and the Internet       They no longer have sufficient staff to generate news stories by making the rounds of civic and business activities   Local newspapers and trade magazines are commonly produced by only one or two staff and these rely upon stories which are increasingly brought to them by PR clarification needed  representatives  according to a senior public relations professional       When the matter was debated at the Foreign Press Association  it was agreed that there was a relationship between the numbers of PR staff employed and journalists unemployed     There was a particularly steep fall in UK advertising revenue in the   months to March       with the Daily Mail   General Trust issuing a warning to investors after its newspaper division reported a     fall in profits largely to a     decline in print advertising revenue  news media commentator Roy Greenslade said in response to this  print cliff fall  that newspapers had no future     Other commentators have said the modern journalism is increasingly being performed in a cheaper  high volume way  describing the resulting product with derogatory terms such as newszak  combination of  news  and  muzak        infotainment and junk food journalism       Speed edit  In their book No Time to Think      authors Howard Rosenberg and Charles S  Feldman emphasised the role of speed in degrading the quality of modern journalism       An example is given of the BBC guide for online staff which gives advice to ensure good quality but also the contradictory advice   Get the story up as fast as you can  We encourage a sense of urgency we want to be first        Combating churnalism edit  Some organizations and tools have arisen to combat churnalism  In April       the Sunlight Foundation  a non profit which advocates for openness and transparency  in partnership with the UK s Media Standards Trust  launched churnalism com  an online tool to discover churn  It used a database of known press releases and compared the text of a submitted URL to determine what percentage of it was derived churn      The Register commented that some level of  churnalism  is both normal and healthy for news organisations  but said it considered the Media Standards Trust was linked to campaigns supported by  wealthy and powerful individuals and celebrities  in favour of  state control of the media  in the UK  and claimed there was significant irony in the Sunlight Foundation tool launch announcement itself being  uncritically churned by many of the usual suspects       In Australia  the nationwide ABC public TV service airs a highly critical weekly    minute programme  Media Watch which regularly exposes churnalism  plagiarism  media bias and unethical behaviour by journalists and radio talk back hosts       See also edit     hour news cycle Circular reporting Content farm Fact checking Hack writer Video news release References edit
