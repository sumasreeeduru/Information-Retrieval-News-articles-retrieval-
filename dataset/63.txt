mass media  in terms of their content  production  or distribution     Sometimes the term independent media is used as a synonym  referencing independence from large media corporations  but this term is also used to indicate media enjoying freedom of the press and independence from government control  Alternative media does not refer to a specific format and may be inclusive of print  audio  film video  online digital and street art  among others  Some examples include the counter culture zines of the     s  ethnic and indigenous media such as the First People s television network in Canada  later rebranded Aboriginal Peoples Television Network   and more recently online open publishing journalism sites such as Indymedia  While mainstream mass media  on the whole   represent government and corporate interests      alternative media tend to be  non commercial projects that advocate the interests of those excluded from the mainstream   for example  the poor  political and ethnic minorities  labor groups  and LGBT identities      These media disseminate marginalized viewpoints  such as those heard in the progressive news program Democracy Now   and create communities of identity  as seen for example in the It Gets Better Project that was posted on YouTube in response to a rise in gay teen suicides at the time of its creation  Alternative media challenge the dominant beliefs and values of a culture and have been described as  counter hegemonic  by adherents of Antonio Gramsci s theory of cultural hegemony  However  since the definition of alternative media as merely counter to the mainstream is limiting  some approaches to the study of alternative media also address the question of how and where these media are created  as well as the dynamic relationship between the media and the participants that create and use them         Contents    Definitions      Common approaches and practices     Democratic theory and the public sphere     Social movement

scholars   See also   References   External links   Definitions edit  There are various definitions of  alternative media   John Downing  for example  defines  radical alternative media  as media  that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies  priorities  and perspectives      In his assessment of a variety of definitions for the term  Chris Atton notes repeatedly the importance of alternative media production originating from small scale  counter hegemonic groups and individuals     Christian Fuchs also argues that alternative media must have four distinct properties  The first being that the audience of these media must be involved in the creation of what is put out in alternative media     The second is that it has to be different from the mainstream     The third is that it should create a perspective different from that of the state and major corporations     The fourth property is that alternative media must  establish different types of relationships with the market and or the state      As defined by Atton and Hamilton  Alternative journalism proceeds from dissatisfaction not only with the mainstream coverage of certain issues and topics but also with the epistemology of news  Its critique emphasizes alternatives to  inter alia   conventions of news sources and representation  the inverted pyramid of news texts  the hierarchical and capitalized economy of commercial journalism  the professional  elite basis of journalism as a practice  the professional norm of objectivity  and the subordinate role of the audience as a receiver      Journalistic Practices says  Alternative media not only allow but also facilitate the participation  in its more radical meaning  of its members  or the community  in both the produced content and the content producing organization   In this sense  participation in alternative media as described and reflected upon by the participants in this study can best be understood as a form of active citizenship        Common approaches and practices edit  Approaches to the academic study of alternative media attempt to understand the ways in which these media are significant  each emphasizing a different aspect of media  including the role of the public sphere  social movements  and the participation by communities that create the media   Democratic theory and the public sphere edit   A public sphere described by Habermas   Coffee House in   C One way of understanding alternative media is to consider their role in the process of democratic communication  Philosopher J rgen Habermas proposed that a healthy democratic community requires a space where rational debate can take place between engaged citizens  It is essential that the dialogue in this public sphere occurs outside the control of any authority so that citizens can exchange ideas as equals      This translates to the need for free speech and a free press  In Habermas s idea of the public sphere  participation is open to everyone  all participants are considered equal  and any issue can be raised for debate      However  this view fails to note the inherent exclusion of women and minorities  and their interests  from the debate in the public sphere  In light of this social inequality  philosopher Nancy Fraser argues for the importance of multiple independent public spheres  in which members of subordinated groups can first deliberate their issues and concerns among themselves and later assert those issues into the larger public sphere  The alternative media associated with these counter public spheres are critical in developing the needs and identity of the group and in challenging the larger dominant public sphere  A feminist counter public sphere is  for example  responsible for circulating the view that women s issues such as domestic abuse and reproductive rights are deserving of debate in the larger public sphere       Social movement media edit  Social movements are a type of collective action  They involve large  sometimes informal  groups or organizations which focus on specific political or social issues and promote  instigate  resist or undo the social change  Social movement media is how social movements use media  and oftentimes  due to the nature of social movements  that media tends to be an alternative  Communication is vital to the success of social movements  Research shows that social movements experience significant difficulties communicating through mainstream media because the mainstream media often systematically distort  stigmatize  or ignore social movement viewpoints      They may deny social movements  access or representation at critical moments in their development  employ message frames that undermine or weaken public perceptions of a movement s legitimacy or implicitly encourage movement actors who seek coverage to cater to the questionable values of mainstream reportage on social activism  including a heightened interest in violence  emotionality  and slogans      This problematic coverage of social movements is often referred to as the protest paradigm  the idea that mass media marginalizes protest groups through their depictions of the protesters  and  by doing so  subsequently support the status quo  As a result  social movements often turn to alternative media forms and practices in order to more effectively achieve their goals    Example of a sign used during the Occupy Wall Street movement  An example of how the mainstream media problematically covers social movements is the Occupy movement  which began with Occupy Wall Street in September       The Occupy movement protested against social and economic inequality around the world  its primary goal being to make the economic and political relations in all societies less vertically hierarchical and more flatly distributed  Among the movement s primary concerns is the system which allows large corporations and the global financial system to manipulate the world in a way that disproportionately benefits a wealthy minority  undermines democracy  and disregards environmental sustainability  In comparing the mainstream news coverage of the Occupy movement against coverage from alternative press several trends emerge  First  mainstream media used confusion over the event as the dominant frame while alternative media focused on what the demonstrators were actually trying to accomplish  Second  the mainstream media placed the protesters at fault of any violence while the alternative media focused on the brutality of the police and their violent acts on the peaceful protesters      For more information about social movements  and alternative media  see Social movement theory  Alternative media tend to be activist by nature  Social movements in areas such as human rights  the environmental movement  and civil rights produce alternative media to further their goals  spread awareness  and inspire participation and support   Human rights edit   A favela in Brazil  An example of a human rights social movement using alternative media is the group WITNESS  WITNESS is a human rights non profit organization and its mission is to partner with on the ground organizations to support the documentation of human rights violations and their consequences  in order to further public engagement  policy change  and justice  They rely on video recordings using technology such as handheld camcorders and smartphones to capture the world s attention and viscerally communicate human rights abuses  They have documented human rights abuses from the police in the favelas of Brazil  children soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  human trafficking in Brazil and the United States  and many other human rights issues  all through the use of alternative media   Environmental movement edit   Protester at a Greenpeace march in       An example of an environment movement using alternative media is the group  Green Peace  Greenpeace is a non governmental environmental organization whose goal is to  ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change  deforestation  overfishing  commercial whaling  genetic engineering  and anti nuclear issues  It uses direct action  lobbying  and research to achieve its goals  as well as alternative media  They use online tactics such as podcasts and blogs     as well as performance art       Civil rights edit  An example of a civil rights group using alternative media was the Student Non violent Coordinating Committee  SNCC   SNCC was one of the most important organizations of the American Civil Rights Movement in the     s  SNCC was involved in voter registration rights in the south  established Freedom Schools  organized the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  MFDP   among many other accomplishments  Alternative media tactics used by SNCC included establishing a dedicated Communication Section which included a  photography arm  its own printing press  which published its newsletter the Student Voice   published publicity materials  and created an alternative wire press       Participatory culture edit  Alternative media have frequently been studied as a manifestation of participatory culture  in which citizens do not act as consumers only  but as contributors or producers as well  By opening up access to media production  participatory culture is believed to further democracy  civic engagement  and creative expression      Participatory culture pre dates the Internet  Amateur Press Associations are a form of participatory culture that emerged late in the   th century  Members of such associations typeset and print their own publications  which are mailed through a network of subscribers  Zines  community supported radio stations  and other types of projects were predecessors of blogs  podcasts  wikis  and social networks  Web services such as Tumblr  Imgur  Reddit  Medium  TikTok  and YouTube  among others  allow users to distribute original content to wider audiences  which makes media production more participatory  Alternative media are also created by participatory journalism as citizens play an active role in collecting  reporting  analyzing  and disseminating news and information  This form of alternative and activist news gathering and reporting functions outside of mainstream media institutions  often as a response to the shortcomings of professional journalism  It engages in journalistic practices but is driven by goals other than profit making  has different ideals  and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy  Participatory media approaches consider participation in producing media content as well as in making decisions about media production processes as a defining feature of alternative media      Participatory culture can be realized in a number of ways  Media literacy is a way to begin participating by understanding media systems  conventions and means of production  Individuals learning to produce media themselves is the step that moves citizens from literacy to participation  Fan fiction  community radio  or low power FM   and hyper local blogging are just a few ways that citizens can produce media content to participate in the production of alternative media  By fostering participation  alternative media contribute to the strengthening of a civic attitude and allow citizens to be active in one of the main spheres relevant to daily life and to put their right to communication into practice  To demonstrate the relationship between democracy and participation in media production  the term citizen s media illustrates that alternative media can help those who are producing media also become active citizens   particularly in a democracy      This idea is tied very closely to community media  see next section    Community media edit  Community media includes citizens  media  participatory media  activist and radical media as well as the broader forms of communication in which local or regional specific platforms are engaged  Like other forms of alternative media  community media seeks to bypass the commercialization of media  The elimination or avoidance of sole ownership or sponsorship is motivated by a desire to be free of oversight or obligation to cater to a specific agenda  Community media is often categorized as grassroots  a description that applies to both the financial structure and the process of content creation  While there is diversity in community media  which varies by media platform  radio  TV  web or print   it is typical that the media source is open to the public community to submit material and content  This open policy aligns with the values of community media to maintain a democratic approach and ethos  Historically community media has served to provide an alternative political voice  Across the world forms of community  media are used to elevate the needs and discourse of a specific space  typically connected by geographical  cultural  social  or economic similarities   Race and indigenous media edit  Minority community media can be both localized and national  serving to disseminate information to a targeted demographic  They provide a platform for discussion and exchange within the minority communities as well as between the minority and the majority communities  Oftentimes minority focused media serves an essential resource  providing their audiences with essential information  in their own language of origin  helping the specified group to participate as equal citizens of their country of residence   These media platforms and outlets create an opportunity for cultural exchange and the elevation or empowerment of a disenfranchised or marginalized group  based on racial  ethnic or cultural identity  Historically  these forms of media have served a dual purpose  to disseminate information to a community that is traditionally ignored or overlooked by major media outlets and as a vehicle for political protest or social reform  Spaces created to address minority discourse typically straddle the line of both alternative and activist media  working to provide a resource unavailable through mainstream measures and to shift the universally accepted perspective or understanding of a specific group of people  Sociologist Yu Shi s exploration of alternative media provides opposing arguments about the role of minority media to both facilitate cultural place making and hinder community assimilation and acculturation  Shi expounds a widely shared understanding that racially informed media provide a place  power  and political agency  Throughout the   th century  media spaces were developed to accommodate the growing multi cultural state of the United States  African Americans created local publications like the Chicago Defender to share critical information to protect citizens from discriminatory practices by police and policy makers  while Jet and Ebony s magazine served to empower the national black identity  lauding the achievements and thought leadership of Black Americans  Similar practices became increasingly common for Latino Latina and Asian groups  As immigration increased post       Spanish language newspapers and television stations  along with the creation of television networks like ICN TV specifically for Chinese immigrants  A critical awareness of an increasingly participatory global media culture in multicultural societies is becoming widespread and a necessary approach to explaining the success and impact of ethnic or minority media  as well as to embrace the changing ways in which people  use  their media   Connections to subaltern studies edit  There are related aims found in alternative media studies and subaltern studies  as a concern for disenfranchised and oppressed voices pervades both fields  Subaltern studies draw on Antonio Gramsci s discussion of  subaltern  groups  that is  groups of people considered to be of inferior rank socially  economically  and politically      One of the most significant questions in subaltern studies is posed by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak   Can the subaltern speak   which she asks in her seminal essay of the same name  Spivak investigates whether the subaltern has a voice within hegemonic political discourses  and if so if their voices are being heard  allowing them to participate  This is important  as the subaltern s ability to participate in politics and other social and cultural practices is key in establishing as well as challenging their subaltern status      This particular body of scholarship is useful to the study and discussion of alternative media due to their shared preoccupation with the ability of disenfranchised peoples to participate and contribute to mainstream hegemonic discourses  especially in regards to ethnic and racial media in which these groups speak from a subaltern position  This connection is strengthened in the work of alternative media scholar Clemencia Rodriguez  In her discussion of citizenship  Rodriguez comments that  Citizens have to enact their citizenship on a day to day basis  through their participation in everyday political practices   As citizens actively participate in actions that reshape their own identities  the identities of others  and their social environments  they produce power       So it could be said that by subaltern groups creating alternative media  they are indeed expressing their citizenship  producing their power  and letting their voice be heard   Forms of media edit  Press   print edit  Main article  Alternative newspaper The alternative press consists of printed publications that provide a different or dissident viewpoint than that provided by major mainstream and corporate newspapers  magazines  and other print media  Factsheet Five publisher Mike Gunderloy described the alternative press as  sort of the  grown up  underground press  Whole Earth  the Boston Phoenix  and Mother Jones are the sorts of things that fall in this classification       In contrast  Gunderloy described the underground press as  the real thing  before it gets slick  co opted  and profitable  The underground press comes out in small quantities  is often illegible  treads on the thin ice of unmentionable subjects  and never carries ads for designer jeans       An example of alternative media is tactical media  which uses  hit and run  tactics to bring attention to an emerging problem  Often tactical media attempts to expose large corporations that control sources of mainstream media  One prominent NGO dedicated to tactical media practices and info activism is the Tactical Technology Collective which assists human rights advocates in using technology   They have released several toolkits freely to the global community  including NGO In A Box South Asia  which assists in the setting up the framework of a self sustaining NGO  Security In A Box      a collection of software to keep data secure and safe for NGOs operating in potentially hostile political climates  and their new short form toolkit    Tactics      which      provides original and artful ways for rights advocates to capture attention and communicate a cause        Radio edit  Radio has been a significant form of alternative media due to its low cost  ease of use  and near ubiquity      Alternative radio has arisen in response to capitalist and or state sponsored mainstream radio broadcasts  For example  in early     s Australia  a new alternative radio sector was created by those who felt excluded from the two sector national broadcasting system  consisting of a national public service broadcaster and commercial services       In the US  the first listener supported independent station  KPFA  began in      in order to provide an avenue for free speech unconstrained by the commercial interests that characterized mainstream radio     Their content ranges broadly  while some stations  primary aims are explicitly political and radical  others namely seek to broadcast music that they believe to be excluded from mainstream radio      Alternative radio often  though not always  takes the form of community radio  which is generally understood as participatory  open  non profit  and made by and for a community      These radio stations may broadcast legally or illegally  as pirate radio  Alternative radio is a global phenomenon      Examples of community and alternative radio endeavors include Tilos R di   Hungary   Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation  Canada    Pacifica Radio and the Prometheus Radio Project  both in the United States   and Radio Sagarmatha  Nepal    Video and film edit  Alternative film and video are generally produced outside of the mainstream film and video industries and features content and or style that is rarely seen in mainstream product      However  its particular genre  content  and form vary widely  It is often produced in non profit organizational contexts  such as video art collectives  e g  Videotage  Los Angeles Filmmakers  Cooperative  or grassroots social justice organizations  e g  Line Break  CINEP Center for Research and Popular Education                   Participatory video projects in which marginalized or under resourced groups tell their stories through video demonstrate the possibility for access and participation in video making to empower those involved  circulate representations unseen in mainstream media  and challenge existing power relations     Alternative film in the United States is evident in the work of The Film   Photo League chapters of the     s  which drew attention to union and class issues through social documentary film and the editing of newsreels      Though initiated in the    s and    s  radical video making reached an apex in the    s  as technology became more accessible  Public access television provided a broadcast outlet for oftentimes punk and hip hop influenced radical cultural critique      Deep Dish TV  for instance  is a television network which seeks to provide media access to grassroots organizations and to marginalized or misrepresented perspectives through public access television      Today  portable  accessible recording technology and the internet allow increasing opportunities for global participation in the production  consumption  and exchange of alternative video content       Internet edit  With the increasing importance attributed to digital technologies  questions have arisen about where digital media fit in the dichotomy between alternative and mainstream media  First  blogs  Facebook  Twitter and other similar sites  while not necessarily created to be information media  increasingly are being used to spread news and information  potentially acting as alternative media as they allow ordinary citizens to bypass the gatekeepers of traditional  mainstream media and share the information and perspectives these citizens deem important  Second  the Internet provides an alternative space for mobilization through the cultivation of interpersonal networks  collective action towards social change  and making information much readily accessible  Typically  among those with deviant  dissident or non traditional views  Internet platforms allow for the creation of new  alternative communities that can provide a voice for those normally marginalized by the mainstream media  In addition  the Internet has also led to an alternative form of programming  which allows both professionals and amateurs to subvert or evade commercial and political restraints on open access to information and information technologies      Some examples of alternative computing are hacking  open source software or systems  and file sharing  Lastly  the Internet also breeds a new way of creation and dissemination of knowledge  commons knowledge  that is different from the top down manner  It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users  fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and folksonomies  Wikipedia is an excellent example of this genre   Street art edit  Often considered guerilla art  street art operates free from the confines of the formal art world      In the form of graffiti  stencil  mural  and print  street art appropriates or alters public spaces as a means of protest and social commentary  Important aspects of street art as an alternative form are its blend of aesthetics and social engagement  use of urban spaces  and interaction with the social landscape of the area in which the art is made      The street art movement gained popularity in the     s as a form of art distinct from high art and commercial venues  but as popularity grew  some street artists moved from the alternative venues of the streets to gallery and museum showings       Cities such as Paris  Buenos Aires  and S o Paulo rose to prominence in using street art as legitimate alternative media through artist collectives and competitions  bringing attention to alternative voices  The internet has also influenced street art greatly by functioning as a platform for artists and fans to share pictures of street art from around the world  Websites like Streetsy com and WoosterCollective com are among the most popular of street art sharing sites       Performance edit  Performance as an alternative medium uses theater  song  and performance art as a means of engaging audiences and furthering social agendas  Performance art is an avant garde art form that typically uses live performances to challenge traditional forms of visual art   It operates as  the antithesis of theatre  challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms       Playing an important role in social and cultural movements from Dada and Surrealism to Post Minimalism  performance art reflects the political environment of the time      While performance art is often relegated to high art  street theater is typically used in a grassroots fashion  utilizing local communities for performance or conversation   It can be used as a form of guerilla theater to protest  like in the case of The Living Theatre which is dedicated to transforming the hierarchy of power in society through experimental theater   Music edit  Certain genres of music and musical performance can be categorized as alternative media  Independent music  or indie music  is music that is produced separate from commercial record labels  Professor David Hesmondhalgh describes indie music s alternative nature as a  hard headed network of post punk companies which made significant challenges to the commercial organization of cultural production favoured by the major record companies       Its subversive roots of sound or lyrics and alternative models of distribution distinguish it from the commercial record companies   Genres edit  Some alternative media can be associated with the political left in the United States  the political right in the United States  and various political positions in the United Kingdom  Primarily concerned with the growing role of new media in alternative media projects  communication scholar Leah Lievrouw identifies five genres of contemporary new media based alternative and activist media  culture jamming  alternative computing  participatory journalism  mediated mobilization  and commons knowledge       Culture jamming generally attempts to critique popular cultures such as entertainment  advertising  and art      It tends to comment on issues of corporate capitalism and consumerism and seeks to provide political commentary  Characteristics of culture jamming texts include the appropriation or repurposing of images  video  sound  or text and that they are ironic or satirical in some sense      Today  culture jamming can come in the form of internet memes and guerrilla marketing  Alternative computing deals with the material infrastructure of informational and communications technologies  It seeks to critique and reconfigure systems with the intention of subverting or evading commercial and political restraints on open access to information and information technologies      Some examples of alternative computing are hacking  open source software or systems  and file sharing  Participatory journalism refers to web based sources of critical or radical news either in the form of online news services or blogs  These alternative outlets of news often adopt the philosophies of citizen journalism and view themselves as providing an alternative to mainstream news and opinion      Participatory journalism projects may cover underreported groups and issues  Within this genre authors and readers of some of these alternative media projects have the ability contribute alike and therefore has the characteristic of being participatory or interactive  An example of participatory journalism is Indymedia Mobilization media relate to communication practices that mobilization or organization social movements  identity  or cultural projects through the use of new media tools and platforms such as Facebook or YouTube  Characteristics of this genre include the cultivation of interpersonal networks  collective action towards social change  and making information much readily accessible      Commons knowledge as a genre refers to projects that provide alternatives to the traditional top down creation and dissemination of knowledge  It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users  fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and folksonomies      Wikipedia is an excellent example of this genre  Thinking of current forms of alternative media in terms of the genre not only allows one to identify the features and conventions of certain modes of communication  but also how  they allow people to express themselves appropriately  and to achieve their various purposes or intentions       In other words  one can begin to understand how the creators and participants of alternative new media projects actively shape their communication practices  YouTube is considered to be not only a commercial enterprise but also a platform designed to encourage cultural participation by ordinary citizens  Although YouTube aimed to be foremost a commercial enterprise  nevertheless  it has become a community media as one of the forms of alternative media  Scholars assume that YouTube s commercial drive may have increased the probability of participation in online video culture for a broader spectrum of participants than before  This idea allows one to shift our concern away from the false contradiction between market driven and non market driven culture towards the tensions between corporate logics and unruly and emergent traits of participatory culture  and the limits of YouTube model for cross cultural diversity and global communication  In theory  YouTube stands as a site of cosmopolitan cultural citizenship      Uploading foreign soap opera episodes and dividing into several pieces to pass YouTube s content limits  can be seen as acts of cultural citizenship similar to the media sharing practices of diverse communities identified by Cunningham and Nguyen             However  people who have the highest chance of encountering other cultural citizens are those who have the access to various contents  information and platforms  this is commonly referred to as the  participation gap   The notion of participation gap makes both digital literacy and digital divide such important issues for cultural politics  Therefore  it is still controversial whether YouTube is just another conduit for strengthening cultural imperialism or one of the alternative media   Aesthetics edit  In association with  experimental and innovative modes of production and collaboration  aesthetics in alternative media can be a political tool used to subvert dominant power  Like many makers of alternative media  scholar Crispin Sartwell identifies politics as an aesthetic environment      As such  these art political systems not only use aesthetics as a tool to gain power but are also produced via aesthetic forms within all media  Thus  it is not uncommon for alternative media to seek new artistic  non traditional  or avant garde means to represent its content  In this case  the use of aesthetics allows alternative media to address otherwise banal content in a manner which re aligns  re negotiates  or exposes the politics at work within it   Form edit  Scholars have linked the Avante garde art movements as one arena where alternative aesthetics are used as a political tool  Movements such as Futurism  Dada  and Situationism looked to challenge the formal rules regarding what art was  how it looked or sounded like  or where it could be in order to radically alter public and political ideology  The logic  reason  and rules of style and beauty  mandated by the dominant class  was rejected as an affirmation of subjugation   Appropriation edit  While some alternative makers look to radically break away from the suffocating restraints of the dominant class by rejecting their dominant visual dogma  others appropriate  twist  and remix in order to subvert dominant language and messaging through mimicry  mockery  and satire  The d tournement  and its successor culture jamming  of the Situationists  the mimicry of Pop Art  and the reworking of normative narratives in slash fiction are examples of appropriation of mainstream media texts   Participation edit  Avant garde movements that have emphasized audience participation include Futurism  Dadaism  Surrealism  Situationism  Pop art  Neo concretism  and the Theatre of the Oppressed      By inviting the audience to participate in the creation of media  collaborators look to subvert or critique hierarchical structures  capitalism  the ivory tower  within society by embracing democratic modes of production  Strategies that involve the input or collaboration of all stakeholders often result in less formally  correct  aesthetics   Notable media scholars edit   Chris Atton Rodney Benson Jean Burgess John D  H  Downing Lauren Kessler Clemencia Rodriguez  sa Wettergren  See also edit  Alternative
