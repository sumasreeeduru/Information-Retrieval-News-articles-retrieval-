sound on tape   SOT   A  sack  is an edited set of video clips for a news story and is common on television  It is typically narrated by a reporter  It is a story with audio  video  graphics and video effects  The news anchor  or presenter  usually reads a  lead in   introduction  before the package is aired and may conclude the story with additional information  called a  tag   A  reader  is an article read without accompanying video or sound  Sometimes an  over the shoulder digital on screen graphic  is added  A voice over  or VO  is a video article narrated by the anchor  Sound on tape  or SOT  is sound or video usually recorded in the field  It is usually an interview or soundbite  Radio was the first medium for broadcast journalism  Many of the first radio stations were co operative community radio ventures not making a profit  Later  radio advertising to pay for programs was pioneered in radio  Later still  television displaced radio and newspapers as the main news sources for most of the public in industrialized countries  Some of the programming on radio is locally produced and some is broadcast by a radio network  for example  by syndication  The  talent   professional voices  talk to the audience  including reading the news  People tune in to hear engaging radio personalities  music  and information  In radio news  stories include speech soundbites  the recorded sounds of events themselves  and the anchor or host  Some radio news might run for just four minutes  but contain       stories  These new bulletins must balance the desire for a broad overview of current events with the audience s limited capacity to focus on a large number of different stories     The radio industry has undergone a radical consolidation of ownership  with fewer companies owning the thousands of stations   Large media conglomerates such as Clear Channel Communications own most of the radio stations in the United States  That has resulted in more  niche  formats and the sharing of resources within clusters of stations  de emphasizing local news and information  There has been concern over whether this concentration serves the public  The opposition says that the range of political views expressed is greatly narrowed and that local concerns are neglected  including local emergencies  for which communication is critical  citation needed  Automation has resulted in many stations broadcasting for many hours a day with no one on the station premises   History edit  When radio first became popular  it was not used as a source of information  rather  people listened to the radio solely for entertainment purposes     This began to change with a man named Edward R  Murrow  Edward Murrow was an American who traveled to England in order to broadcast news about World War II  He stayed in London throughout the war and was the first to report on events such as bombings in London and updated the people on Hitler s reign  Murrow gained his fame mainly after reporting on Hitler s German army annexing Austria  Many Americans relied on his broadcasts throughout the war to gain information about the war     More people also began to rely on radio for information after the attacks on Pearl Harbor  People found out about the bombing through President Roosevelt s broadcast interrupting their daily programming  It set Americans on edge  and people began to rely more heavily on the radio for major announcements throughout World War II     World War II was a time where radio broadcasting became a much larger industry because it was the easiest and quickest way for people to get updates on what was going on throughout the world  Informative radio continued while television reporting also began to take flight  Throughout the     s and     s television news sources grew  but radio still dominated  It wasn t until John F  Kennedy s assassination in      that television newscasting took off  Radio could only capture the sound of the event  but television showed people the true horror of the assassination     This was one of the first major events in which news companies competed with each other to get the news out to the public first  CBS News was the first to report that Kennedy had been shot and was killed     News crews spent the next several days covering everything happening in Washington  including Kennedy s funeral     This set the standard for news stations to have to cover major events quicker and get them out to the public as they were happening  The JFK assassination helped to transform television journalism to how it is today  with instantaneous coverage and live coverages at major events  Television offered faster coverage than radio and allowed viewers to feel more as if they were experiencing the event because they could visualize exactly what was going on     NBC  National Broadcasting Company  and CBS  Columbia Broadcasting System  were the two competing forces of news broadcasting in the early years of broadcast journalism  NBC was established in      and CBS in       There was a divide in the industry because they were not only competing against each other  but radio news that had already been established     Women had a hard time immersing themselves into radio news seeing as most of the radio broadcasts were men  There was a small number of women who hosted programs that were for homemakers and were on entertainment broadcast      After World War II  the doors for women in broadcasting opened up  This was also due to the shortage of men that were home during the war  so news outlets looked to women to fill those gaps of times   In the     s and     s larger numbers of women began to enter into broadcast news field  Both radio and television are major sources for broadcast journalism today  even with rapidly expanding technology  Television still focuses on covering major events  but radio broadcasts focus more on analyzing stories rather than reporting breaking news      Although the history of broadcast journalism has its origins in the early days of radio transmission  it is television with its attractive visuals and rapid dissemination that has empowered broadcast journalism to emerge as the most influential form of journalism until the rise of the Internet and the new forms of journalism associated with digital technologies      The internet often beats out broadcast journalism in terms of reporting breaking news  and the field of broadcast journalism is constantly having to adapt to the changing technology of today   Television edit  Television  TV  news is considered by many to be the most influential medium for journalism      For most of the American public  local news and national TV newscasts are the primary news sources      Not only the numbers of audience viewers  but the effect on each viewer is considered more persuasive   The medium is the message        Television is dominated by attractive visuals  including beauty  action  and shock   with short soundbites and fast  cuts   changes of camera angle   Television viewing numbers have become fragmented  with the introduction of cable news channels  such as Cable News Network  CNN   Fox News Channel and MSNBC    A journalist works on location at the Loma Prieta Earthquake in San Francisco s Marina District October       Local television edit  The industry divides local television in North America into media markets  These television markets are defined by viewing area and are ranked by the number of audience viewers  New broadcast journalists generally start in the smaller markets with fewer viewers and move up to larger television stations and television networks after gaining experience  The larger stations usually have more resources and better pay  United States stations typically broadcast local news three or four times a day  around        am        or noon    or   pm  and    or    at night  Most of the nightly local newscasts are    minutes  and include sports television and weather  News anchors are shown sitting at a desk in a television studio  The news anchors read teleprompters that contain local interest stories and breaking news  Reporters frequently tell their stories outside the formal television studio in the field  in a remote broadcast setting where Electronic news gathering  ENG  techniques are used with production trucks  Daytime television or morning shows include more  soft  news and feature pieces  while the evening news emphasizes  hard  news   Education edit  Many young journalists start out by learning about broadcast journalism through high school courses  They learn how to navigate the newsroom and equipment  and they learn the ethics and standards of journalism      Although learning the responsibilities of a journalist is important  education is required to work in broadcast journalism  A bachelor s degree in      journalism  broadcast journalism or interactive media      can lead to a career in broadcast production  However  a heavy amount of the education they receive is hands on activity through internships and working for on campus broadcasting stations  This real world view of the field combined with classes that teach students the ins and outs of writing  capturing video  interviewing and editing creates a developed and prepared journalist      Finding a job in the broadcasting field can be tough due to the decreased viewing and limited number of stations in each location  but the online media presence is causing employment to be      predicted to decline by    from      to             News jobs edit  News anchors  formerly  anchormen   serve as masters of ceremonies and are usually shown facing a professional video camera in a television studio while reading unseen teleprompters  The anchors are often in pairs  co anchors   who sit side by side and often alternate their reading  Meteorologists stand in front of chroma key backgrounds to describe weather forecasting and show maps  charts and pictures  Reporters research and write the stories and sometimes use video editing to prepare the story for air into a  package   Reporters are usually engaged in electronic field production  EFP  and are accompanied by a videographer at the scenes of the news  the latter holds the camera  The videographer or assistants manage the audio and lighting  they are in charge of setting up live television shots and might edit using a non linear editing system  NLE   Segment producers choose  research and write stories  as well as deciding the timing and arrangement of the newscast  Associate producer  if any  specialize in other elements of the show such as graphics   Production jobs edit  Main article  Television crew A newscast director is in charge of television show preparation  including assigning camera and talent  cast  positions on the set  as well as selecting the camera shots and other elements for either recorded or live television video production  The technical director  TD  operates the video switcher  which controls and mixes all the elements of the show  At smaller stations  the Director and Technical Director are the same person  A graphics operator operates a character generator  CG  that produces the lower third on screen titles and full page digital on screen graphics  The audio technician operates the audio mixing console  The technician is in charge of the microphones  music and audio tape  Often  production assistants operate the teleprompters and professional video cameras and serve as lighting and rigging technicians  grips    Business changes edit  Broadcast journalism is changing rapidly  causing issues within the business as well  Many people can no longer find jobs in broadcast journalism because much more is online and does not even need to be broadcast by a person  Others are being laid off to invest more money into new technologies  Other changes include innovations allowing TV stations to better alert viewers in emergencies and have higher quality services       Online convergence edit  Convergence is the sharing and cross promoting of content from a variety of media  all of which  in theory  converge and become one medium  In broadcast news  the internet is a key to convergence  Frequently  broadcast journalists also write text stories for the Web  usually accompanied by the graphics and sound of the original story  Websites offer the audience an interactive form where they can learn more about a story  can be referred to related articles  can offer comments for publication and can print stories at home  Technological convergence also lets newsrooms collaborate with other media  broadcast outlets sometimes have partnerships with their print counterparts    Social media edit  Citizen broadcast journalism is a new form of technology that has allowed regular civilians to post stories they see through outlets such as Snapchat  Facebook  and Twitter  It has become a new trend that some allegedly fear will take over broadcast journalism as it is known  News companies  like Fox News  are employing citizen journalists  which is a new phenomenon in journalism       Fake news edit  The terms  fake news  and  yellow journalism  have taken over broadcast journalism throughout the years  Its impact on broadcast journalism played a role in how news about the election was spread      Fake news defines how viewers see news that may be misleading or false  The main aim of yellow journalism is to gather the attention of people in the society      Many of these false or misleading stories came out during the      election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump       See also edit      hour news cycle Broadcasting Broadcasting of
