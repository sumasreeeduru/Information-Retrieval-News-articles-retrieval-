Paul Reuter worked at a book publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in       These publications brought much attention to Reuter  who in      developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from      on  in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen     in what today is Aachen s Reuters House  Reuter moved to London in      and established a news wire agency at the London Royal Exchange  Headquartered in London  Reuter s company initially covered commercial news  serving banks  brokerage houses  and business firms     The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in       and more began to subscribe soon after        According to the Encyclop dia Britannica   the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance      It was the first to report Abraham Lincoln s assassination in Europe  for instance  in             In       Reuter incorporated his private business  under the name Reuter s Telegram Company Limited  Reuter was appointed managing director of the company     In       Reuter s expanded into the Far East  followed by South America in       Both expansions were made possible by advances in overland telegraphs and undersea cables     In       Reuter retired as managing director  and was succeeded by his eldest son  Herbert de Reuter     In       Reuter s began transmitting messages electrically to London newspapers        th century edit   Roderick Jones  general manager           Reuter s son Herbert de Reuter continued as general manager until his death by suicide in       The company returned to private ownership in       when all shares were purchased by Roderick Jones and Mark Napier  they renamed the company  Reuters Limited   dropping the apostrophe     In       Reuters began using radio to transmit news internationally  a pioneering act     In       the Press Association  PA  of Great Britain acquired a majority interest in Reuters  and full ownership some years later     During the world wars  The Guardian reported that Reuters   came under pressure from the British government to serve national interests  In      Reuters deflected the pressure by restructuring itself as a private company   In      Reuters was the first broadcasting company to broadcast news of Heinrich Himmler s attempts to negotiate with the western allies through Count Bernadotte  a Swedish nobleman  The new owners formed the Reuters Trust     In       the PA sold half of Reuters to the Newspaper Proprietors  Association  and co ownership was expanded in      to associations that represented daily newspapers in New Zealand and Australia     The Reuters Trust Principles were put in place to maintain the company s independence     At that point  Reuters had become  one of the world s major news agencies  supplying both text and images to newspapers  other news agencies  and radio and television broadcasters      Also at that point  it directly or through national news agencies provided service  to most countries  reaching virtually all the world s leading newspapers and many thousands of smaller ones   according to Britannica     In       Reuters scooped news of the erection of the Berlin Wall      Reuters was one of the first news agencies to transmit financial data over oceans via computers in the     s     In       Reuters  began making computer terminal displays of foreign exchange rates available to clients      In       Reuters began supporting electronic transactions on its computer network and afterwards developed a number of electronic brokerage and trading services     Reuters was floated as a public company in           when Reuters Trust was listed on the stock exchanges    such as the London Stock Exchange  LSE  and NASDAQ     Reuters later published the first story of the Berlin Wall being breached in              st century edit  Reuters  share price grew during the dotcom boom  then fell after the banking troubles in          In       Britannica wrote that most news throughout the world came from three major agencies  the Associated Press  Reuters  and Agence France Presse     Until       the Reuters news agency formed part of an independent company  Reuters Group plc  Reuters merged with Thomson Corporation in Canada in       forming Thomson Reuters     In       Thomson Reuters withdrew from the LSE and the NASDAQ  instead listing its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX  and the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE      The last surviving member of the Reuters family founders  Marguerite  Baroness de Reuter  died at age    on    January           The parent company Thomson Reuters is headquartered in Toronto  and provides financial information to clients while also maintaining its traditional news agency business     In       Thomson Reuters appointed Jim Smith as CEO     In July       Thomson Reuters agreed to sell its intellectual property and science operation for       billion to private equity

jobs out of its around        employees       Journalists edit  Reuters employs some       journalists and     photojournalists     in about     locations worldwide        Reuters journalists use the Reuters Handbook of Journalism as a guide for fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests  to  maintain the values of integrity and freedom upon which their reputation for reliability  accuracy  speed and exclusivity relies       In May       Kurt Schork  an American reporter  was killed in an ambush while on assignment in Sierra Leone  In April and August       news cameramen Taras Protsyuk and Mazen Dana were killed in separate incidents by U S  troops in Iraq  In July       Namir Noor Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh were killed when they were struck by fire from a U S  military Apache helicopter in Baghdad          During       cameramen Adlan Khasanov in Chechnya and Dhia Najim in Iraq were also killed  In April       cameraman Fadel Shana was killed in the Gaza Strip after being hit by an Israeli tank      While covering China s Cultural Revolution in Peking in the late     s for Reuters  journalist Anthony Grey was detained by the Chinese government in response to the jailing of several Chinese journalists by the colonial British government of Hong Kong      He was released after being imprisoned for    months from      to      and was awarded an OBE by the British

Barakat Syrian Syria    December       Criticism and Controversies edit  Accusation of collaboration with the CIA edit  In October       Rolling Stone published an article by journalist Carl Bernstein  in which the author wrote that  according to information from CIA officials  Reuters cooperated with the Agency          In response to that  Reuters  then managing director  Gerald Long  had asked for evidence of the charges  but no one provided them       Policy of objective language edit   Reuters building entrance in New York City Reuters has a policy of taking a  value neutral approach  which extends to not using the word terrorist in its stories  The practice attracted criticism following the September    attacks      Reuters  editorial policy states   Reuters may refer without attribution to terrorism and counterterrorism in general  but do not refer to specific events as terrorism  Nor does Reuters use the word terrorist without attribution to qualify specific individuals  groups or events       By contrast  the Associated Press does use the term terrorist in reference to non governmental organizations who carry out attacks on civilian populations      In       Reuters asked a Canadian newspaper chain to remove Reuters  bylines  as the Canadian newspaper had edited Reuters articles to insert the word terrorist       Climate change reporting edit  In July       David Fogarty  former Reuters climate change correspondent in Asia  resigned after a career of almost    years with the company and wrote that  progressively  getting any climate change themed story published got harder  following comments from then deputy editor in chief Paul Ingrassia that he was a climate change sceptic  In his comments  Fogarty stated               By mid October  I was informed that climate change just wasn t a big story for the present  but that it would be if there was a significant shift in global policy  such as the US introducing an emissions cap and trade system  Very soon after that conversation I was told my climate change role was abolished  Ingrassia  formerly Reuters  managing editor  previously worked for The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones for    years          Reuters responded to Fogarty s piece by stating   Reuters has a number of staff dedicated to covering this story  including a team of specialist reporters at Point Carbon and a columnist  There has been no change in our editorial policy       Subsequently  climate blogger Joe Romm cited a Reuters article on climate as employing  false balance   and quoted Dr  Stefan Rahmstorf  Co Chair of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute that   s imply  a lot of unrelated climate skeptics nonsense has been added to this Reuters piece  In the words of the late Steve Schneider  this is like adding some nonsense from the Flat Earth Society to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites  It is absurd   Romm opined   We can t know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and non germane  climate sceptics nonsense  into the piece  but we have a strong clue  If it had been part of the reporter s original reporting  you would have expected direct quotes from actual skeptics  because that is journalism      The fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor        Photograph controversies edit  According to Ynetnews  Reuters was accused of bias against Israel in its coverage of the      Israel Lebanon conflict after the wire service used two doctored photos by a Lebanese freelance photographer  Adnan Hajj      In August       Reuters announced it had severed all ties with Hajj and said his photographs would be removed from its database      In       Reuters was criticised again by Haaretz for  anti Israeli  bias when it cropped the edges of photos  removing commandos  knives held by activists and a naval commando s blood from photographs taken aboard the Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid  a raid that left nine Turkish activists dead  It has been alleged that in two separate photographs  knives held by the activists were cropped out of the versions of the pictures published by Reuters      Reuters said it is standard operating procedure to crop photos at the margins  and replaced the cropped images with the original ones after it was brought to the agency s attention       Accusations of pro Fernando Henrique Cardoso bias edit  In March       the Brazilian affiliate of Reuters released a text containing an interview with Brazilian ex president Fernando Henrique Cardoso about the ongoing Petrobras scandal  Petrobras is a state owned oil company in Brazil  In       it was discovered that many politicians of Brazil were involved in corruption due to giving contracts of the company to different corporations for exchange of money  After this scandal  a text was released which contains Brazil s former president Fernando Henrique s interview    One of the paragraphs mentioned a comment by a former Petrobras manager  in which he suggests corruption in that company may date back to Cardoso s presidency  Attached to it  there was a comment between parenthesis   Podemos tirar se achar melhor    we can take it out if  you  think better        which is now absent from the current version of the text      It suggests that former president was involved in corruption and he wants them to cut out that text   The agency later issued a text in which they confirm the mistake  explaining it was a question by one of the Brazilian editors to the journalist who wrote the original text in English  and that it was not supposed to be published       Funding by the UK Government edit  In November      the UK Foreign Office released archive documents confirming that it had provided funding to Reuters during the     s and     s so that Reuters could expand its coverage in the Middle East  An agreement was made between the Information Research Department  IRD  and Reuters for the UK Treasury to provide          over   years to fund Reuters  expansion  The UK government had already been funding the Latin American department of Reuters through a shell company  however  this method was discounted for the Middle East operation due to the accounting of the shell company looking suspicious  with the IRD stating that the company  already looks queer to anyone who might wish to investigate why such an inactive and unprofitable company continues to run       Instead  the BBC was used to fund the project by paying for enhanced subscriptions to the news organisation which the treasury would reimburse the BBC for at a later date  The IRD acknowledged that this agreement would not give them editorial control over Reuters  although the IRD believed it would give them political influence over Reuters  work  stating  this influence would flow  at the top level  from Reuters  willingness to consult and to listen to views expressed on the results of its work            See also edit    Journalism portal United Kingdom portal Interbank market  competitor List of news agencies Media of the United
