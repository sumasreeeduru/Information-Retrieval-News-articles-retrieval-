department within the Board of Trade under Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy as a service to mariners  The loss of the passenger vessel  the Royal Charter  and     lives off the coast of Anglesey in a violent storm in October      led to the first gale warning service  FitzRoy established a network of    coastal stations from which visual gale warnings could be provided for ships at sea  The new electric telegraph enabled rapid dissemination of warnings and also led to the development of an observational network which could then be used to provide synoptic analysis  The Met Office started in      to provide weather forecasts to newspapers   FitzRoy requested the daily traces of the photo barograph at Kew Observatory  invented by Francis Ronalds  to assist in this task and similar barographs and as well as instruments to continuously record other meteorological parameters were later provided to stations across the observing network         Publication of forecasts ceased in May      after FitzRoy s death but recommenced in April        Connection with the Ministry of Defence edit   Former Met Office building in Bracknell  Berkshire  before relocation to Exeter  since demolished Following the First World War  the Met Office became part of the Air Ministry in       the weather observed from the top of Adastral House  where the Air Ministry was based  giving rise to the phrase  The weather on the Air Ministry roof   As a result of the need for weather information for aviation  the Met Office located many of its observation and data collection points on RAF airfields  and this accounts for the large number of military airfields mentioned in weather reports even today  In      the Met Office split with services to the Royal Navy being provided by its own forecasting services  It became an executive agency of the Ministry of Defence in April       a quasi governmental role  being required to act commercially   Change in ownership edit  Following a machinery of government change  the Met Office became part of the Department for Business  Innovation and Skills on    July          and subsequently part of the Department for Business  Energy and Industrial Strategy following the merger of BIS and the Department of Energy and Climate Change on    July          Although no longer part of the MOD  the Met Office maintains strong links with the military through its front line offices at RAF and Army bases both in the UK and overseas and its involvement in the Joint Operations Meteorology and Oceanography Centre  JOMOC  with the Royal Navy   The Mobile Met Unit  MMU  are a unit consisting of Met Office staff who are also RAF reservists who accompany forward units in times of conflict advising the armed forces of the conditions for battle  particularly the RAF   Locations edit   The      headquarters building on the edge of Exeter In September      the Met Office moved its headquarters from Bracknell in Berkshire to a purpose built    m structure at Exeter Business Park  near junction    of the M  motorway  The new building was officially opened on    June        a few weeks short of the Met Office s    th anniversary   by Robert May  Baron May of Oxford  It has a worldwide presence   including a forecasting centre in Aberdeen  and offices in Gibraltar and on the Falklands   Other outposts lodge in establishments such as the MetOffice Reading  formerly the Joint Centre for Mesoscale Meteorology  at University of Reading in Berkshire  the Joint Centre for Hydro Meteorological Research  JCHMR  site at Wallingford in Oxfordshire  and there is a Met Office presence at Army and Air Force bases within the UK and abroad  including frontline units in conflict zones      Royal Navy weather forecasts are generally provided by naval officers  not Met Office personnel   Forecasts edit  Shipping forecast edit  Main article  Shipping Forecast The Shipping Forecast is produced by the Met Office and broadcast on BBC Radio    for those traversing the seas around the British Isles   Weather forecasting and warnings edit  The Met Office issues Severe Weather Warnings for the United Kingdom through the National Severe Weather Warning Service  NSWWS   These warn of weather events that may affect transport infrastructure and endanger people s lives   In March       the system was improved and a new stage of warning was introduced  the  Advisory       In September      the Met Office established a  name our storms  project  the aim is to provide a single authoritative naming system for the storms that affect the UK and Ireland by asking the public to suggest names  On    November  the first named storm was Abigail       Weather prediction models edit  The main role of the Met Office is to produce forecast models by gathering information from weather satellites in space and observations on earth  then processing it with a variety of models  based on a software package known as the unified model  The principal weather products for UK customers are    hour forecasts from the operational     km resolution UKV model covering the UK and surroundings      replacing the   km model      hour forecasts from the    km resolution NAE model covering Europe and the North Atlantic  and     hour forecasts from the    km resolution global model  replacing the    km global model       The Met Office s Global Model forecast has consistently been in the top   for global weather forecast performance  in the decades up to       in independent verification to WMO standards      failed verification  Products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad  provided for MOD operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa  If necessary  forecasters may make adjustments to the computer forecasts  Data is stored in the Met Office s own PP format   Flood Forecasting Centre edit  Main article  Flood Forecasting Centre Formed in       the Flood Forecasting Centre  FFC  is a joint venture between the Environment Agency and the Met Office to provide flood risk guidance for England and Wales  The Centre is jointly staffed from both parent organisations and is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter      In Scotland this role is performed by the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service  a joint venture between the Scottish Environment Protection Agency  SEPA  and the Met Office       Seasonal forecasts edit  The Met Office makes seasonal and long range forecasts and distributes them to customers and users globally       The Met Office was the first climate and weather forecast provider to be recognised as a Global Producing Centre of long range forecasts by the World Meteorological Organisation and continues to provide forecasts to the WMO for dissemination to other national meteorological services worldwide      Met Office research has broken new ground in seasonal forecasting for the extratropics and has demonstrated its abilities in its seasonal predictions of the North Atlantic Oscillation and winter climate for Europe and North America           Supply of forecasts for broadcasting companies edit  One of the main media companies  ITV produce forecasts for ITV Weather using the Met Office s data and animated weather symbols  The BBC used to use Met Office forecasts for all of its output  but on    August       it was announced that the BBC would be replacing the Met Office with MeteoGroup  a competing provider   as part of the corporation s legal obligation to provide best value for money for the licence fee payers      The BBC still uses some Met Office data for certain forecasts  particularly severe weather warnings and the Shipping Forecast   World Area Forecast Centre edit  Main article  World Area Forecast Centre The Met Office is one of only two World Area Forecast Centres or WAFCs  and is referred to as WAFC London  The other WAFC is located in Kansas City  Missouri  and known as WAFC Washington  WAFC data is used daily to safely and economically route aircraft  particularly on long haul journeys  The data provides details of wind speed and direction  air temperature  cloud type and tops  and other features   Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre edit  Main article  Volcanic Ash Advisory Center As part of its aviation forecast operation the Met Office operates the London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre  VAAC       This provides forecasts to the aviation industry of volcanic ash clouds that could enter aircraft flight paths and impact aviation safety  The London VAAC  one of nine worldwide  is responsible for the area covering the British Isles  the north east Atlantic and Iceland  The VAAC were set up by the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   an agency of the United Nations  as part of the International Airways Volcano Watch  IAVW       The London VAAC makes use of satellite images  plus seismic  radar and visual observation data from Iceland      the location of all of the active volcanoes in its area of responsibility   The NAME dispersion model developed by the Met Office is used to forecast the movement of the ash clouds       and    hours from the time of the alert at different flight levels   Air quality edit  Main article  UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau The Met Office issues air quality forecasts made using NAME  the Met Office s medium to long range atmospheric dispersion model  It was developed as a nuclear accident model following the Chernobyl accident in       but has since evolved into an all purpose dispersion model capable of predicting the transport  transformation and deposition of a wide class of airborne materials  NAME is used operationally by the Met Office as an emergency response model as well as for routine air quality forecasting  Aerosol dispersion is calculated using the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols model model  The forecast is produced for pollutants and their typical health effects are shown in the following table     Pollutant Health Effects at High Level   Nitrogen dioxideOzoneSulphur dioxide These gases irritate the airways of the lungs  increasing the symptomsof those suffering from lung diseases     Particulates  Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and a worsening of heart and lung diseases  IPCC edit  Main article  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Until      the Met Office hosted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group  chaired by John Houghton  on climate science   In      the working group moved to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration       High performance computing edit  Due to the large amount of computation needed for Numerical Weather Prediction and the Unified model  the Met Office has had some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world  In November      the Met Office supercomputer was ranked third in the world         Year  Computer  Calculations per second  Horizontal resolution  global local   Number of vertical levels         Ferranti Mercury    kiloflops   N A      km     levels         English

stations edit  Reports  observations  from weather stations can be automatic  totally machine produced   semi automatic  part machine and part manual   or manual  Some stations produce manual observations during business hours and revert to automatic observations outside these times  Many stations feature  present weather  sensors  CCTV  etc  There is also a network of  upper air  stations  using Radiosondes   The six main radiosonde stations in the UK are Camborne  Lerwick  Albemarle  Watnall  Castor Bay and Herstmonceux  Currently  the global radiosonde network includes about     upper air stations  and about two thirds make observations twice daily  at      and      UTC   Some stations have limited reporting times  while other report continuously  mainly RAF and Army Air Corps stations where a manned met office is provided for military operations  The  standard  is a once hourly reporting schedule  but automatic stations can often be  polled  as required  while stations at airfields report twice hourly  with additional  often frequent in times of bad weather  special reports as necessary to inform airfield authorities of changes to the weather that may affect aviation operations  Some stations report only CLIMAT data  e g  maximum and minimum temperatures  rainfall totals over a period  etc   and these are usually recorded at      and      hours daily  Weather reports are often performed by observers not specifically employed by the Met Office  such as Air traffic control staff  coastguards  university staff and so on    Eskdalemuir
