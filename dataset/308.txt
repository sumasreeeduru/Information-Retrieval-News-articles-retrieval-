a photograph album An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc  CD   vinyl  audio tape  or another medium  Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early   th century as individual    rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album  this format evolved after      into single vinyl LP records  played at         rpm  The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid     s to the early   st century  a period known as the album era     Vinyl LPs are still issued  though album sales in the   st century have mostly focused on CD and MP  formats  The   track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from      until being phased out by      and was gradually supplanted by the compact cassette during the     s and early     s  the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late     s  sharply declined during the     s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the     s  An album may be recorded in a recording studio  fixed or mobile   in a concert venue  at home  in the field  or a mix of places  The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years  This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately  and then brought or  mixed  together  Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed  live   even when done in a studio  Studios are built to absorb sound  eliminating reverberation  to assist in mixing different takes  other locations  such as concert venues and some  live rooms   have reverberation  which creates a  live  sound     Recordings  including live  may contain editing  sound effects  voice adjustments  etc  With modern recording technology  artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones  with each part recorded as a separate track  Album covers and liner notes are used  and sometimes additional information is provided  such as analysis of the recording  and lyrics or librettos        Historically  the term  album  was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format  In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century     Later  collections of related   rpm records were bundled in book like albums     one side of a    rpm record could hold only about     minutes of sound   When long playing records were introduced  a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an  album   the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc  MiniDisc  Compact audio cassette    track tape and digital albums as they were introduced

on which decrees  edicts  and other public notices were inscribed in black  It was from this that in medieval and modern times album came to denote a book of blank pages in which verses  autographs  sketches  photographs and the like are collected     This in turn led to the modern meaning of an album as a collection of audio recordings issued as a single item  In the  early nineteenth century  album  was occasionally used in the titles of some classical music sets  such as Schumann s Album for the Young Opus     a set of    short pieces     With the advent of   rpm records in the early     s  the typical    inch disc could only hold about three minutes of sound per side  so almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length     Classical music and spoken word items generally were released on the longer    inch   s  playing around     minutes per side  For example  in       George Gershwin recorded a drastically shortened version of his new seventeen minute composition  Rhapsody in Blue with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra  The recording was issued on both sides of a single record  Victor       and ran for  m   s       By       though some European record companies had issued albums of complete operas and other works  the practice of issuing albums was not widely taken up by American record companies until the     s  By about       bound collections of empty sleeves with a paperboard or leather cover  similar to a photograph album  were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records  the term  record album  was printed on some covers   These albums came in both    inch and    inch sizes  The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside  allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright  like a book  suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them  In the     s  record companies began issuing collections of    rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums  typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover  Most albums included three or four records  with two sides each  making six or eight compositions per album     The    inch and    inch LP record  long play   or         rpm microgroove vinyl record  is a gramophone record format introduced by Columbia Records in           A single LP record often had the same or similar number of tunes as a typical album of   s  and it was adopted by the record industry as a standard format for the  album      Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability  it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums  The term  album  was extended to other recording media such as   track tape  Compact audio cassette  compact disc  MiniDisc  and digital albums  as they were introduced     As part of a trend of shifting sales in the music industry  some observers feel that the early   st century experienced the death of the album       Length An album may contain as many or as few tracks as required  In the United States  The Recording Academy s rules for Grammy Awards state that an album must comprise a minimum total playing time of    minutes with at least five distinct tracks or a minimum total playing time of    minutes with no minimum track requirement      In the United Kingdom  the criteria for the UK Albums Chart is that a recording counts as an  album  if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than    minutes      Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as  mini albums  or EPs      Albums such as Tubular Bells  Amarok  Hergest Ridge by Mike Oldfield  and Yes s Close to the Edge  include fewer than four tracks  but still surpass the    minute mark  The album Dopesmoker by Sleep contains only a single track  but the composition is over    minutes long  There are no formal rules against artists such as Pinhead Gunpowder referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as  albums   If an album becomes too long to fit onto a single vinyl record or CD  it may be released as a double album where two vinyl LPs or compact discs are packaged together in a single case  or a triple album containing three LPs or compact discs  Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re release several CDs in one single box with a unified design  often containing one or more albums  in this scenario  these releases can sometimes be referred to as a  two  or three  fer    or a compilation of previously unreleased recordings  These are known as box sets  Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once  in the form of boxed sets  although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album   Tracks This section does not cite any sources  Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced

tracks  A music track  often simply referred to as a track  is an individual song or instrumental recording  The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks  the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles  When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings a track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side  On a compact disc the track number is indexed so that a player can jump straight to the start of any track  On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content   Bonus tracks  A bonus track  also known as a bonus cut or bonus  is a piece of music which has been included as an extra  This may be done as a marketing promotion  or for other reasons  It is not uncommon to include singles as bonus tracks on re issues of old albums  where those tracks weren t originally included  Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves  bonus tracks may be included if a customer buys a whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist  The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as a stand alone download  adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album  In contrast to hidden tracks  bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have a gap of silence between other album tracks  Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists  since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying a domestically released version  Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase       Audio formats See also  Timeline of audio formats Non audio printed format Main article  Sheet music Commercial sheet music are published in conjunction with the

many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles  which are released separately to radio  TV or the Internet as a way of promoting the album       Albums have been issued that are

control what they listened to          The Walkman was convenient because of its size  the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with a clip for belts or pants      Compact cassettes also saw the creation of mixtapes  which are tapes containing a compilation of songs created by any average listener of music      The songs on a mixtape generally relate to one another in some way  whether it be a conceptual theme or an overall sound      The compact cassette used double sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale          The music is recorded on both the  A  and  B  side of the tape  with cassette being  turned  to play the other side of the album      Compact Cassettes were also a popular way for musicians to record  Demos  or  Demo Tapes  of their music to distribute to various record labels  in the hopes of acquiring a recording contract      The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the     s  after the release and distribution Compact Discs  After the introduction of Compact discs  the term  Mixtape  began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format      Recently there has been a revival of Compact Cassettes by independent record labels and DIY musicians who prefer the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet       Compact disc  A compact disc within an open jewel

copies worldwide  as the world s best selling album Most albums are studio albums   that is  they are recorded in a recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album  They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment  In some studios  each member of a band records their part in separate rooms  or even at separate times  while listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right   In recent years  with the advent of email  it has become possible for musicians to record their part of a song in another studio in another part of the world  and send their contribution over email to be included in the final product

 There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation a band member can solicit from other members of their band  and still have the album referred to as a solo album  One reviewer
