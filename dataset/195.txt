air television network and the second BBC flagship service in the United Kingdom  Isle of Man and Channel Islands  It covers a wide range of subject matter  but tends to broadcast more  highbrow  programmes than the more mainstream and popular BBC One  Like the BBC s other domestic TV and radio channels  it is funded by the television licence  and is therefore free of commercial advertising  It is a comparatively well funded public service network  regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public service networks worldwide  Originally styled BBC   it was the third British television station to be launched  starting on    April        and from   July       Europe s first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour  It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming  and while this tendency has continued to date  most special interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on BBC Two  for example the BBC Proms  now tend to appear on BBC Four instead   Contents    History      Launch     Technological advancements     Operation   Programming   Presentation      Regional variations     Availability outside the UK   Accessibility   BBC Two HD   See also   References    External links   History edit  Further information  Timeline of BBC Two Launch edit  British television at the time of BBC  s launch consisted of two channels  the BBC Television Service and the ITV network made up of smaller regional companies  Both channels had existed in a state of competition since ITV s launch in       and both had aimed for a populist approach in response  The      Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting noticed this  and that ITV lacked any culturally relevant programming  It therefore decided that Britain s third television station should be awarded to the BBC     Prior to its launch  the new BBC  was promoted on the BBC Television Service  the soon to be renamed BBC   The animated adverts featured the campaign mascots  Hullabaloo   a mother kangaroo  and  Custard   her joey  Prior to  and several years after  the channel s formal launch  the channel broadcast  Trade Test Transmissions   short films made externally by companies such as Shell and BP  which served to enable engineers to test reception  but became cult viewing  The channel was scheduled to begin at       on    April       showing an evening of light entertainment  starting with the comedy show The Alberts  a performance from Soviet comedian Arkady Raikin  and a production of Cole Porter s Kiss Me  Kate  culminating with a fireworks display  However  at around       a huge power failure  originating from a fire at Battersea Power Station  caused Television Centre  and indeed much of west London  to lose all power  BBC  was able to continue broadcasting via its facilities at Alexandra Palace  but all attempts to show the scheduled programmes on the new channel failed  Associated Rediffusion  the London weekday ITV franchise holder  offered to transmit on the BBC s behalf  but their gesture was rejected  At       programming was officially postponed until the following morning  As the BBC s news centre at Alexandra Palace was unaffected  they did in fact broadcast brief bulletins on BBC  that evening  beginning with an announcement by the newsreader Gerald Priestland at around           There was believed to be no recording made of this bulletin  but a videotape was discovered in early          By       on    April  power had been restored to the studios and programming began  thus making Play School the first programme to be shown officially on the channel  The launch schedule  postponed from the night before  was then successfully shown that evening  albeit with minor changes  In reference to the power cut  the transmission opened with a shot of a lit candle which was then sarcastically blown out by presenter Denis Tuohy       BBC Two logo used from    November      to    February      To establish the new channel s identity and draw viewers to it  the BBC decided that a widely promoted  lavish series would be essential in its earliest days  The production chosen was The Forsyte Saga         a no expense spared adaptation of the novels by John Galsworthy  featuring well established actors Kenneth More and Eric Porter  Critically for the future of the fledgling channel  the BBC s gamble was hugely successful  with an average of six million viewers tuning in per episode  a feat made more prominent by the fact that only   million were able to receive the channel at the time  citation needed   Technological advancements edit  Unlike BBC  and ITV  BBC  was broadcast only on the     line UHF system  so was not available to viewers still using sets only capable of receiving the     line VHF system  This created a market for dual standard receivers which could switch between the two systems  Set manufacturers increased production of UHF sets in anticipation of a large market demand for the new BBC   but the market did not materialise  The early technical problems  which included being unable to transmit US recorded videotapes due to a lack of system conversion from the US NTSC system  were resolved by a committee headed by James Redmond  On   July       during the Wimbledon Championships  BBC  became the first channel in Europe to begin regular broadcasts in colour  using the PAL system     The thirteen part series Civilisation        was created as a celebration of two millennia of western art and culture to showpiece the new colour technology     BBC  and ITV later joined BBC  on     line UHF band but continued to simulcast on     line VHF until       BBC  and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on    November       although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour  unofficially  since September       In       the station adopted the first computer generated channel identification  ident  in Britain  with its use of the double striped  orange     logo  The ident  created in house by BBC engineers  lasted until March      and heralded the start of computer generated logos  As the switch to digital only terrestrial transmission progressed  BBC Two was  in each region in turn  the first analogue TV channel to be replaced with the BBC multiplex  at first four  then two weeks ahead of the other four channels  This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current Freeview service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service  The last region for BBC Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was Northern Ireland on    October       At the      Edinburgh International Television Festival  BBC Two was named  Terrestrial Channel of the Year      A high definition simulcast of BBC Two began broadcasting on    March       replacing the standalone BBC HD channel     As of    November      update   there are   variations of BBC Two HD  Wales  Northern Ireland  and England       Operation edit  The channel controllers have been              Michael Peacock            David Attenborough            Robin Scott            Aubrey Singer            Brian Wenham            Graeme MacDonald            Alan Yentob            Michael Jackson            Mark Thompson            Jane Root            Roly Keating            Janice Hadlow            Kim Shillinglaw         present  Patrick Holland Adam Barker served as Acting Controller of the channel after Janice Hadlow left the channel in March      and until Kim Shillinglaw began as the new permanent occupant of the post  Since       the Controller of BBC Two has been given the expanded title Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four  with ultimate oversight of the BBC Four service added to their duties  a BBC Four  Channel Editor   reporting up to this Controller  has day to day operational control of Four   The channel forms part of the BBC Television executive group and is answerable to the head of that department  and to the BBC Trust  On    January       Kim Shillinglaw announced that she has decided to leave the BBC as the Controller of BBC Two   BBC Four and  as a result of the reorganisation  the posts of Controller of BBC Two and Four have been closed      Patrick Holland became Channel Controller of BBC Two in March       following his earlier appointment as Channel Editor in July             Programming edit  Main article  List of television programmes broadcast by the BBC BBC Two s remit is to be a mixed genre channel appealing to a broad adult audience with programmes of depth and substance  It should carry the greatest amount and range of knowledge building programming of any BBC television channel  complemented by distinctive comedy  drama and arts programming   BBC Two remit     BBC Two s remit historically was one screening programmes targeting the arts  culture  some comedy and drama  and appealing to audiences not already served by BBC One or ITV  Over its first thirty or so years the channel developed a reputation for screening highly praised and prestigious drama series  among these Boys from the Blackstuff              s highly successful The Men s Room  a spectacular costume drama Middlemarch        or      s critically acclaimed Our Friends in the North  The channel s  highbrow  profile is also in part attributable to a long history of demanding documentaries of all types  beginning with Civilisation and The Ascent of Man in the     s  Like the early Channel    BBC Two also established for itself a reputation as a champion of independent and international cinema  under the Screen   brand  The channel has sometimes been judged  increasingly in more recent years  to have moved away from this original role and closer to the mainstream  Since the launch of the digital only BBC Four  the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel  which  until the end of the UK s digital TV switchover in October           a minority       in the final quarter of           of viewers did not receive  BBC Four s remit is very similar to that of the earlier remit of BBC  and contains many documentaries and arts programmes  It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings      Since      there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two s earlier output with the arts strand The Culture Show  Its most popular programme at the moment is Top Gear  Much of BBC Two s output has previously or subsequently been shown on other channels  Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in a late night strand  originally called BBC Four on Two but now unbranded  for the benefit of audiences without access to BBC Four  Other programmes are moved to the channel as a result of their success on BBC Three or Four  so that subsequent series are well received  An example of this is the BBC Three series Torchwood that was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series  BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship BBC One  such examples include Have I Got News for You and popular comedies Absolutely Fabulous and Miranda  which moved to BBC One after success on Two  Also in August      The Great British Bake Off moved to BBC One due to its success the previous year on BBC Two  In       Bake Off moved from BBC One to Channel    Another founding part of BBC Two was to provide educational and community programming on the BBC  as part of its public service remit  The educational section of this commitment saw BBC  broadcast a large amount of programming for the Open University  who co produced programming with the corporation  and saw the channel broadcast BBC Schools programmes from      until the programmes were transferred to the BBC Learning Zone in       As a result of the channel s commitment to community broadcasting  the channel produced the symbolic Open Space series  a strand developed in the early     s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time  and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film on an issue most important to them  BBC  s Community Programme Unit kept this aspect of the channel s tradition alive into the     s in the form of Video Diaries and later Video Nation  The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in       Since January       BBC Two stopped showing children s programmes and replaced the weekday morning schedule with repeats of the previous BBC One daytime schedule  They also started showing Sign Zone in the early hours  which BBC One used to show before       From October       BBC Two has shown classic programmes like Bergerac  Cagney and Lacey  The Rockford Files   Allo  Allo   and Are You Being Served  on weekday afternoons  with the retro logos from     s and     s  between the current programmes  In October       Russell Howard s Good News and Backchat moved to BBC Two from BBC Three  In       BBC Two commissioned Britain s first transgender sitcom  Boy Meets Girl  which follows the developing relationship between Leo  a    year old man  and Judy  a    year old transgender woman      From   April       the morning Sign Zone was shown before Victoria Derbyshire between     am      am including See Hear on Wednesday morning  BBC Two is also known for broadcasting some news and current affairs programmes  It broadcasts BBC News updates every morning at  am simulcasting the BBC News channel after it stops simulcasting BBC Breakfast on BBC   At      pm during the Parliament session  political debate programme Politics Live is broadcast on BBC   On Wednesdays  due to the Prime Minister s Questions  the programme is broadcast at the earlier time of      am  The programme is not broadcast on Fridays or when Parliament is on a holiday break  so the simulcast of BBC News continues until     pm for the BBC News at One on BBC   At      pm  current affairs programme Newsnight takes a look at the day s headlines and talks to the people about it  BBC  doesn t broadcast any news and current affairs programming at the weekend  From      until       it broadcast the UK selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest  Eurovision  You Decide  The channel stopped broadcasting the show after the      edition due to the fact that the BBC opted for an internal selection in collaboration with BMG Rights Management  In       it was reported that Victoria Derbyshire would come to an end as part of the BBC s    m cuts      Since the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic Derbyshire has been presenting the first hour of BBC News which continues until         Presentation edit  Main article  History of BBC television idents  The sans serif   served as the channel s design icon between      and       and was used in several different forms   Paint   pictured above  was the first such variant to air  and aired between      and      and again between      and       As well as programmes  BBC Two has also proved memorable for its numerous idents various short sequences shown between programme junctions that serve as the channel identity  Nearly all of the identity packages used since the channel s launch in      have featured a prominent numeral   in the design  Notable designs include the electronic double striped    the white TWO ident  the only ident not to use a numeral     and most notably the       s  The      idents featured a sans serif numeral   at the centre of an initially art related scene  however  the idents moved away from this style as the station s style changed  Although highly praised  this expansive set of idents was ended in November       The BBC corporate logo was updated within the idents in October       though the idents moved away from the original viridian colour scheme in these latter years  The subsequent presentation style was introduced on    November      and kept the same figure    but in a yellow background and given a personality  At the time  BBC Two became the first BBC channel to feature a box logo  In       BBC Two debuted the new theme  a  Window on the World   with the   numeral providing that view  Introduced on    February       the new look also had the channel adopt a teal coloured box logo  featuring the BBC logo above the word TWO  in the font Avenir  In       in honour of the channel s   th anniversary  some of the     s idents were re introduced and from       BBC Two Northern Ireland opted to use nearly forty idents from the           set  On    September       the           idents were retired once again and BBC Two introduced a new set of idents  based on scenes incorporating a curve motif resembling the number    The new branding is designed to reflect BBC Two s  constant evolution  constant eclecticism   and  constant sense of quality   The new idents are produced by various artists and studios  including Aardman Animations  The Mill and others  The new identity was co developed by BBC Creative and Superunion               Regional variations edit  BBC Two also has regional variations in Wales and Northern Ireland  These versions of BBC Two share the same idents  but with the nation name in the BBC Two box  BBC Two Scotland showed a lot of specifically Scottish programming on the channel  as well as its sister channel BBC One Scotland  and the schedules were often mixed around to match  BBC Two Northern Ireland and BBC Two Wales both have the option to opt out of the main network schedule but generally stick to it  only opting out a couple of times each week  Until December       BBC Wales broadcast a special  digital only channel  BBC  W  which contained more opt outs than analogue only BBC Two Wales  BBC Two Scotland existed until February      when it was replaced with the national BBC Two feed in preparation for the launch of the BBC Scotland channel  In England  many of the BBC English regions were combined to form  super regions   such as the entire North or Midlands  These had the option to opt out of the network programming on the analogue feed  and replace it with local programming  However this was usually only done in exceptional circumstances  as all regular regional programming has been transferred to BBC One  and the English regions are not available on digital on BBC Two  There is no specific  BBC Two England   this role is fulfilled by the network version of BBC Two   Availability outside the UK edit  The Northern Irish version of BBC Two is widely available in the Republic of Ireland on satellite and cable  as well as being received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland  or in coastal areas from Wales  The networked version of BBC Two is also available on cable and IPTV in the Netherlands  Belgium  Switzerland  Monaco and Liechtenstein  On    March       it began being carried by British Forces Broadcasting Service  BFBS  to members of HM Forces and their families around the world  replacing the BFBS  TV channel  which already carried a selection of BBC Two programmes      It shares a channel with CBBC  which broadcasts from early morning until the early evening       Accessibility edit  The BBC announced in May      that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have subtitles for viewers with hearing difficulties          These are available on the BBC Red Button  and until    October       via the Ceefax teletext service  The BBC also offers audio description on some popular programmes     for visually impaired viewers as well as sign language interpretation on some of its programmes for deaf and hard of hearing viewers  The percentage of the BBC s total television output with audio description available is      having been increased from    in            BBC Two HD edit  Originally  programmes from BBC Two were shown in high definition on the dedicated BBC HD channel  alongside programmes from BBC Three and BBC Four  as well as some select series from CBBC and CBeebies  However  in plans outlined by the director general Mark Thompson on   October       BBC HD would close to be replaced by BBC Two HD  a high definition simulcast of BBC Two that would work much the same way as BBC One HD      This move allowed the corporation to save      million  used to count towards its budget deficit following the freezing of the licence fee and the additional financial responsibility of addition services      On    February       it was announced that BBC Two HD would replace BBC HD from      am on    March           Channel numbers for the BBC s HD channels also changed on Sky  to allow BBC One HD and BBC Two HD to sit side by side on channels      and     respectively on the EPG          On    July       the BBC indicated that it wants to launch Northern Irish  Scottish and Welsh variations of BBC Two HD  however  this would require the approval of the BBC Trust  with a proposal due to be presented within six months      On    December       BBC Two HD was swapped with the SD channel in England on Sky s EPG for HD subscribers      In October       the BBC announced that regional variants of BBC Two HD in Wales and Northern Ireland would launch at the end of November that year on terrestrial  satellite  Wales only  and iPlayer  BBC Two HD in these regions were swapped with the SD channel on Sky s EPG for HD subscribers  Due to the impending launch of the new BBC Scotland channel in February       replacing the opt outs on BBC Two Scotland  no Scottish HD variant was required   See also edit    BBC portal Television portal History of BBC television idents List of television stations in the United Kingdom References edit       British Television up to the end of
