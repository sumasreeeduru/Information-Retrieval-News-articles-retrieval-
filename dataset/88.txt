used to support American intervention in the Cuban War of Independence  In journalism  and more specifically  the mass media   sensationalism is a type of editorial tactic  Events and topics in news stories are selected and worded to excite the greatest number of readers and viewers  This style of news report encourages biased impressions of events rather than neutrality  and may cause a manipulation to the truth of a story     Sensationalism may rely on reports about generally insignificant matters and portray them as a major influence on society  or biased presentations of newsworthy topics  in a trivial  or tabloid manner  contrary to general assumptions of professional journalistic standards        Some tactics include being deliberately obtuse     appealing to emotions     being controversial  intentionally omitting facts and information     being loud and self centered  and acting to obtain attention     Trivial information and events are sometimes misrepresented and exaggerated as important or significant  and often include stories about the actions of individuals and small groups of people     the content of which is often insignificant and irrelevant to the macro level day to day events occurring globally   Contents    History   In mass media   In broadcasting   Online   See also   References   External links   History edit  In A History of News  author Mitchell Stephens  professor of journalism and mass communication at New York University     notes sensationalism can be found in the Ancient Roman Acta Diurna  official notices and announcements which were presented daily on public message boards  the perceived content of which spread with enthusiasm in illiterate societies      Sensationalism was used in books of the   th and   th century  to teach moral lessons  According to Stevens  sensationalism brought the news to a new audience when it became aimed at the lower class  who had less of a need to accurately understand politics and the economy  to occupy them in other matters  Through sensationalism  he claims  the audience was further educated and encouraged to take more interest in the news     The more modern forms of sensationalism developed in the course of the nineteenth century in parallel with the expansion of print culture in industrialized nations  A genre of British literature   sensation novels   became in the     s the best example of how the publishing industry could capitalize on a rhetoric made of surprising turns in the narrative to market serialized fiction in the expanded market of the periodical press  The London magazine  Belgravia  edited by the popular author of sensation novels Mary Elizabeth Braddon between      and      offered one of the earliest theories of modernity and its  shock value  mediated by sensationalism  The attention grasping rhetorical techniques found in sensation fiction were also employed in articles on science  modern technology  finance  and in historical accounts of contemporary events  as discussed by Alberto Gabriele in Reading Popular Culture in Victorian Print     The collection of essays Sensationalism and the Genealogy of Modernity  a Global Nineteenth Century Perspective edited by Alberto Gabriele is also helpful to track the transhistorical presence of sensationalism in several national contexts in the course of the long nineteenth century  Scholars in the collection engage in an interdisciplinary discussion on popular culture  literature  performance  art history  theory  pre cinema and early cinema      In mass media edit  One presumed goal of sensational reporting is to increase or sustain viewership or readership  from which media outlets can price their advertising higher to increase their profits based on higher numbers of viewers and or readers         Sometimes this can lead to a lesser focus on objective journalism in favor of a profit motive      in which editorial choices are based upon sensational stories and presentations to increase advertising revenue      Additionally  advertisers tend to have a preference for their products or services to be reported positively in mass media  which can contribute to bias in news reporting in favor of media outlets protecting their profits and revenues  rather than reporting objectively about stated products and services          However  newspapers have a duty to report and investigate stories related to political corruption  Such investigative journalism is right and proper when it is backed up with documents  interviews with responsible witnesses  and other primary sources  Journalists and editors are often accused of sensationalizing scandals by those whose public image is harmed by the legitimate reporting of the scandal  News organizations are not obliged to  and are often ethically obliged not to  avoid stories that might make local  state and national public figures uncomfortable  Occasionally  news organizations mistakenly relay false information from unreliable anonymous sources  who use mass media as a tool for retaliation  defamation  victim and witness tampering  and monetary or personal gain  Therefore  any story based on sources who may be reasonably assumed to be motivated to act in this way is best interpreted with critical thinking  citation needed  In extreme cases  mass media may report only information that makes a  good story  without regard for factual accuracy or social relevance   It has been argued that the distrust in government that arose in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal created a new business tactic for the media and resulted in the spread of negative  dishonest and misleading news coverage of American politics          such examples include the labeling of a large number of political scandals  regardless of their importance  with the suffix   gate       Such stories are often perceived  rightly or wrongly  as politically partisan or biased towards or against a group or individual because of the sensational nature in which they are reported  A media piece may report on a political figure in a biased way or present one side of an issue while deriding another  It may include sensational aspects such as zealots  doomsayers and or junk science  Complex subjects and affairs are often subject to sensationalism  Exciting and emotionally charged aspects can be drawn out without providing the elements needed  such as pertinent background  investigative  or contextual information  for the audience to form its own opinions on the subject  citation needed   In broadcasting edit  Sensationalism is often blamed for the infotainment style of many news programs on radio and television     According to sociologist John Thompson  the debate of sensationalism used in the mass medium of broadcasting is based on a misunderstanding of its audience  especially the television audience  Thompson explains that the term  mass   which is connected to broadcasting  suggests a  vast audience of many thousands  even millions of passive individuals      Television news is restricted to showing the scenes of crimes rather than the crime itself because of the unpredictability of events  whereas newspaper writers can always recall what they did not witness     Television news writers have room for fewer words than their newspaper counterparts  Their stories are measured in seconds  not column inches  and thus  even with footage  television stories are inherently shallower than most newspaper stories  using shorter words and familiar idioms to express ideas which a newspaper writer is more free to expand upon and define with precision  citation needed   Online edit  The digital revolution has completely changed the way people both produce and consume news content  From a production standpoint  news outlets are now at a much higher risk of releasing content that is false because of how quickly news is circulated through the internet in order to capitalize on those views and clicks for profit      From a consumption standpoint  this means fewer people reading physical copies of newspapers and this is reflective in the way headlines are created for print media  The introduction of the term  clickbait  into the forefront of the global lexicon has had implications in many major world events  specifically the election of Donald J  Trump to the presidency of the United States  His coining of the term  Fake News  was able to capitalize on many people s mistrust in the sensational headlines which are often required to make a profit in online news production and the    hour news cycle   Another reason for the concern over internet sensationalism is the way certain algorithms can create  news loops  that show people the exact same thing over and over again  Many characters on the internet have been able to profit off of these tactics by instilling fear through completely ridiculous and unverified sources which are able to self permeate online through these algorithms      While these algorithms are meant to prioritize more trustworthy sources  this doesn t always happen since they rely on keywords and phrases      As politics have become more polarized  these tactics have become increasingly prominent as news outlets realize how easy it is to push their own agendas on the internet in this fashion  Many countries have implemented response efforts to this issue  as distrust in the media has become a global concern alongside the rapidly changing format of news media        See also edit
