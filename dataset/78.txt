philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop  a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force  to compete directly with CBS  NBC  and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia      In July         th Century Fox announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of     of Fox Filmed Entertainment  the parent company of   th Century Fox Film Corporation      A year later    th Century Fox earned      million in its fiscal third period ended May           in contrast to a loss of       million in the third period of the previous year      Subsequently  and prior to founding FNC  Murdoch had gained experience in the    hour news business when News Corporation s BSkyB subsidiary began Europe s first    hour news channel  Sky News  in the United Kingdom in           With the success of his fourth network efforts in the United States      experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of   th Century Fox  Murdoch announced on January           that News Corp  would launch a    hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp   worldwide platform  for Fox programming   The appetite for news   particularly news that explains to people how it affects them   is expanding enormously       In February       after former U S  Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive     Roger Ailes left cable television channel America s Talking  now MSNBC   Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel  Ailes demanded five months of    hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October             At its debut    million households were able to watch FNC      however  it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles  Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of    minute single topic shows such as Fox on Crime or Fox on Politics  surrounded by news headlines  Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest  The flagship newscast at the time was The Schneider Report  with Mike Schneider s fast paced delivery of the news  During the evening  Fox featured opinion shows  The O Reilly Report  later The O Reilly Factor   The Crier Report  hosted by Catherine Crier  and Hannity   Colmes  From the beginning  FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation  Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention  this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said  even if they could not hear the host  with on screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker  and  bullet points  when a host was delivering commentary   Fox News also created the  Fox News Alert   which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred    Fox News Studios in       To accelerate its adoption by cable providers  Fox News paid systems up to     per subscriber to distribute the channel      This contrasted with the normal practice  in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming  When Time Warner bought Ted Turner s Turner Broadcasting System  a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems  Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel  not Fox News  Fox News claimed this violated an agreement  to carry Fox News   Citing its agreement to keep its U S  headquarters and a large studio in New York City  News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani s administration to pressure Time Warner Cable  one of the city s two cable providers  to transmit Fox News on a city owned channel      City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner s cable franchises in the city      During the September          attacks  Fox News was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day  The ticker has remained  informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast  it has proven popular with viewers       Political alignment Further information  Media bias in the United States Fox News has been described as practicing biased reporting in favor of the Republican Party  the George W  Bush and Donald Trump administrations  and conservative causes while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light                  Critics have cited the channel as detrimental to the integrity of news overall          Fox News employees have said that news reporting operates independently of its opinion and commentary programming  and have denied bias in news reporting  while former employees have said that Fox ordered them to  slant the news in favor of conservatives       During Trump s presidency  observers have noted a pronounced tendency of the Fox News Channel to serve as a  mouthpiece  for the administration  providing  propaganda  and a  feedback loop  for Trump  with one presidential scholar stating   It s the closest we ve come to having state TV            Outlets

dedicated to streaming news clips formatted for video enabled mobile phones       Ratings and reception In       Fox News saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the U S  invasion of Iraq  At the height of the conflict  according to some reports  Fox News had as much as a      increase in viewership  averaging     million viewers daily       In       Fox News  ratings for its broadcast of the Republican National Convention exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks  During President George W  Bush s address  Fox News attracted     million viewers nationally  NBC  ABC  and CBS had a viewership of     million      million  and     million respectively  Between late      and early       Fox News saw a brief decline in ratings  One was in the second quarter of       when it lost viewers for every prime time program compared with the previous quarter  The audience for the Special Report with Brit Hume  for example  dropped      Several weeks later  in the wake of the      North Korean missile test and the      Lebanon War  Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the No    rated cable news channel      Fox produced eight of the top ten most watched nightly cable news shows  with The O Reilly Factor and Hannity   Colmes finishing first and second respectively      FNC ranked No    in viewership among all cable channels in       and No    in           The channel ranked number one during the week of Barack Obama s election  November      in       and reached the top spot again in January       during the week of the special Senate election in Massachusetts       Comparing Fox to its    hour news channel competitors  in May      the channel drew an average daily prime time audience of     million viewers  versus         for MSNBC and         for CNN       In September       the Pew Research Center published a report on the public view of national news organizations  In the report     percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as  favorable   while    percent of polled Democratic viewers and    percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion  However  Fox was given the highest  unfavorable  rating of all national outlets studied     percent of all polled viewers   The report went on to say   partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since            A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in      that positive perceptions of FNC had declined from           of polled voters said they trust it  down from     in       while     said they distrust it  up from     in       It was also called the  most trusted  network by     of those polled  more than had said the same of any other network        Then Fox anchor Megyn Kelly covering the      Democratic National Convention On the night of October           Fox set a record for its highest rated telecast  with      million viewers for the third U S  presidential debate      In prime time the week before  Fox averaged almost     million viewers with a total day average of      million viewers      In prime time and total day ratings for the week of April    to           Fox News  propelled by its coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing  was the highest ranked network on U S  cable television  for the first time since August       when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States      January      marked Fox News s    th consecutive month as the number one rated cable news channel  During that month  Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both prime time hours and the total day      In the third quarter of       the network was the most watched cable channel during prime time hours      During the final week of the campaign for the United States elections        Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel  news or otherwise  On election night itself  Fox News  coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between    and    years of age      The network hosted the first prime time GOP candidates  forum of the      campaign on August    The debate reached a record breaking    million viewers  by far the largest audience for any cable news event      In       the Fox News was rated by Nielsen as America s most watched cable network  averaging a record     million viewers in prime time and total day during the period of January   to December               The COVID    pandemic led to increased viewership for all cable news networks  For the first calendar quarter of         January     March   Fox News had their highest rated quarter in the network s history  with Nielsen showing a prime time average total audience of       million viewers  Sean Hannity s program  Hannity  weeknights at  PM ET was the top rated show in cable news for the quarter averaging     million viewers  a figure that not only beat out all of its cable news competition but also placed it ahead of network competition in the same time slot  Fox ended the quarter with the top five shows in prime time  with Fox s Tucker Carlson Tonight finishing the quarter in second overall with an average audience of     million viewers  followed by The Five  The Ingraham Angle  and Special Report with Bret Baier  The Rachel Maddow Show was the highest non Fox show on cable  coming in sixth place  Finishing the quarter in   nd place was The Lead with Jake Tapper  CNN s highest rated show      According to a Fox News article on the subject  Fox   Friends averaged     million viewers  topping CNN s New Day and MSNBC s Morning Joe combined  The same Fox News article noted that the Fox Business Network also had its highest rated quarter in history and that Fox News itself finished March as the highest rated network in cable for the   th consecutive month      and the digital platforms excelled  too   the article claimed      According to the Los Angeles Times on August            Fox News Channel had six of last week s    highest rated prime time programs to finish first in the network ratings race for the third time since June            A Morning Consult survey the week after Election Day      showed    percent of Republicans in the United States had an unfavorable opinion of Fox News  while    percent of Republicans viewed the network favorably  compared to    percent before the election  A McClatchy news story suggested criticism from Donald Trump as a major reason  as well as the network s early calling of Arizona for Joe Biden  and later joining other networks in declaring Biden the winner of the      election      Ratings were also down for Fox News  Although it remained ahead of other networks overall  its morning show fell out of first place for the first time since       Trump recommended OANN  which was gaining viewers   Newsmax was also increasing in popularity       Demographics As indicated by a New York Times article  based on Nielsen statistics  Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic      In       in the       age group  Fox News had an average of         viewers  but dropped to         in      while increasing its overall audience from      million in      to      million in       The median age of a prime time viewer was    as of      update       A      Pew Research Center survey showed that among those who named Fox News as their main source for political news      are aged    or older      According to a      Gallup poll      of Fox viewers  either identify as or lean Republican       The      Pew survey showed that among people who named Fox News as their main source for political and election news      identify as Republicans  Among the top eight political news sources named by at least    of American adults  the results show Fox News and MSNBC as the two news channels with the most partisan audiences       Slogan Fox News Channel originally used the slogan  Fair and Balanced   which was coined by network co founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established  The New York Times described the slogan as being a  blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr  Ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks           In a      interview with Peter Robinson of the Hoover Institution  Rupert Murdoch defended the company s  Fair and Balanced  slogan saying  In fact  you ll find just as many Democrats as Republicans on and so on       In August       Fox News sued comedian Al Franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them  A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right  which is critical of Fox News Channel      The lawsuit was dropped three days later  after Judge Denny Chin refused its request for an injunction  In his decision  Chin ruled the case was  wholly without merit  both factually and legally   He went on to suggest that Fox News  trademark on the phrase  fair and balanced  could be invalid      In December       FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan  when AlterNet filed a cancellation petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  to have FNC s trademark rescinded as inaccurate  AlterNet included Robert Greenwald s documentary film Outfoxed        as supporting evidence in its case      After losing early motions  AlterNet withdrew its petition  the USPTO dismissed the case      In       FNC used the slogan  We Report  You Decide   referring to  You Decide        FNC s original slogan for its coverage of election issues   In August       Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the  Fair and Balanced  slogan in favor of  Most Watched  Most Trusted   when these changes were reported in June      by Gabriel Sherman  a writer who had written a biography on Ailes   a network executive said the change  has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions   It was speculated by media outlets that Fox News Channel was wishing to distance itself from Ailes  tenure at the network              In March       the network introduced a new ad campaign  Real News  Real Honest Opinion  The ad campaign is intended to promote the network s opinion based programming and counter perceptions surrounding  fake news           In mid November       following the election  Fox News began to use the slogan  Standing Up For What s Right  to promote its primetime lineup       Content Benghazi attack and aftermath Further information       Benghazi attack Fox News provided extensive coverage of the      Benghazi attack  which host Sean Hannity described in December      as  the story that the mainstream media ignores  and  obviously  a cover up  And we will get to the bottom of it       Programming analysis by Media Matters found that during the twenty months following the Benghazi attacks  FNC ran       segments on the issue  including           segments involving Susan Rice s September          Sunday news show appearances  during which she was falsely accused of lying     segments on Special Report  the network s flagship news program     segments alleging a  cover up  by the Obama administration     interviews of GOP members of Congress  but just five interviews of Democratic members of Congress and Obama administration officials     comparisons to Iran Contra  Watergate  and the actions of the Nixon administration     segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a  stand down order  to prevent a rescue operation in Benghazi Over nearly four years after the Benghazi attack  there were ten official investigations  including six by Republican controlled House committees  None of the investigations found any evidence of scandal  cover up or lying by Obama administration officials  On June           Fox News broadcast a segment by news anchor Bret Baier entitled  Whatever happened to the Benghazi investigation   which repeated some of the accusations the network had previously made about Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton  but for which the women had been exonerated by the official investigations       Uranium One Further information  Uranium One controversy From      into       Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of Uranium One to Russian interests  which host Sean Hannity characterized as  one of the biggest scandals in American history       According to Media Matters the Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day  with particular emphasis by Hannity      The network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that  as Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for      million in bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation  Donald Trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president              No evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton had been found after four years of allegations  an FBI investigation  and the      appointment of a Federal attorney to evaluate the investigation  In November       Fox News host Shepard Smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal  infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC      Hannity later called Smith  clueless   while Smith stated   I get it  that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining  I get that  I don t work there  I wouldn t work there            Pro Republican and pro Trump bias Fox News Channel has been widely described as providing biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions                              the Republican Party             and President Donald Trump                          Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein described Fox News as an expanded part of the Republican Party          Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A  Hopkins wrote that Fox News helped  Republicans communicate with their base and spread their ideas  and they have been effective in mobilizing voters to participate in midterm elections  as in      and             Prior to       Fox News lacked an ideological tilt  and had more Democrats watch the channel than Republicans       During the      presidential election  Fox News was markedly more hostile in its coverage of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry  and distinguished itself among cable news outlets for heavy coverage of the Swift Boat smear campaign against Kerry                 During President Obama s first term in office  Fox News helped launch and amplify the Tea Party movement  a conservative movement within the Republican party that organized protests against Obama and his policies                                   During the Republican primaries  Fox News was perceived as trying to prevent Trump from clinching the nomination      However  under Trump s presidency  Fox News remade itself into his image  as hardly any criticism of Trump could be heard on Fox News  prime time shows            In Fox News  news reporting  the network dedicated far more coverage to Hillary Clinton related stories  which critics said was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into Russian interference in the      election       Trump provided significant access to Fox News during his presidency  giving    interviews to the channel while only   in total to other news channels by November       The New York Times described Trump s Fox News interviews as  softball interviews  and some of the interviewers  interview styles as  fawning        similarly  The Economist has described the network s coverage of Trump s presidency as  reliably fawning        From      to       the Fox News prime time line up changed from being skeptical and questioning of Trump to a  Trump safe space  with a dose of Bannonist populism once considered on the fringe        The Fox News website has also become more extreme in its rhetoric since Trump s election  according to Columbia University s Tow Center for Digital Journalism  the Fox News website has  gone a little Breitbart  over time       At the start of       Fox News mostly ignored high profile scandals in the Trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets  such as White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter s resignation amid domestic abuse allegations  the downgrading of Jared Kushner s security clearance and the existence of a non disclosure agreement between Trump and the porn star Stormy Daniels       In March       Jane Mayer reported in The New Yorker that Fox News com reporter Diana Falzone had the story of the Stormy Daniels Donald Trump scandal before the      election  but that Fox News executive Ken LaCorte told her   Good reporting  kiddo  But Rupert  Murdoch  wants Donald Trump to win  So just let it go   and the story was killed  LaCorte denied making the statement to Falzone  but conceded   I was the person who made the call  I didn t run it upstairs to Roger Ailes or others   I didn t do it to protect Donald Trump   adding   Falzone  had put up a story that just wasn t anywhere close to being something I was comfortable publishing   Nik Richie  who claimed to be one of the sources for the story  called LaCorte s account  complete bullshit   adding  Fox News was culpable  I voted for Trump  and I like Fox  but they did their own  catch and kill  on the story to protect him            A      study found Fox News gave disproportionate attention to polls suggesting low approval for President Bill Clinton       A      study found Fox News was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Democrats  and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Republicans       A      study comparing Fox News Channel s Special Report With Brit Hume and NBC s Nightly News coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during      concluded  Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC   suggesting  if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC     they should consider Fox as alternative  rather than mainstream  media        Research finds that Fox News increases Republican vote shares and makes Republican politicians more partisan                     A      study  using the introduction of Fox News into local markets             as an instrumental variable  found that in the      presidential election  Republicans gained     to     percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News   suggesting  Fox News convinced   to    percent of its viewers to vote Republican  depending on the audience measure       These results were confirmed by a      study       A      study  using the same instrumental variable  found congressional  representatives become less supportive of President Clinton in districts where Fox News begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where Fox News was not broadcast        A      study  using channel positions as an instrumental variable  found  Fox News increases Republican vote shares by     points among viewers induced into watching     additional minutes per week by variation in position        Another      paper found Fox News viewing increased Republican vote shares among voters who identified as Republican or independent       Fox News publicly denies it is biased  with Murdoch and Ailes saying have included Murdoch s statement that Fox has  given room to both sides  whereas only one side had it before        Fox News host Chris Wallace has said   I think we are the counter weight  to NBC News      they have a liberal agenda  and we tell the other side of the story        In       Robert Greenwald s documentary film Outfoxed  Rupert Murdoch s War on Journalism argued Fox News had a conservative bias and featured clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president John Moody directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects            A leaked memo from Fox News vice president Bill Sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the United States debate has been cited as an example of the pro Republican Party bias of Fox News  His memo asked the staff to  use the term  government run health insurance   or  when brevity is a concern   government option   whenever possible   The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised Sean Hannity on his Fox show   If you call it a public option  the American people are split  If you call it the government option  the public is overwhelmingly against it        Surveys suggest Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological  A      Pew survey found Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America  with    percent of those surveyed said Fox News is  mostly conservative      percent said  mostly liberal  and    percent said  neither   In comparison  MSNBC had    percent identify it as  mostly liberal      percent as  mostly conservative  and    percent as  neither   CNN had    percent describe it as  mostly liberal      percent as  mostly conservative  and    percent as  neither        A      Pew Research Center survey found FNC was cited  unprompted  by    percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization       A Rasmussen poll found    percent of Americans felt Fox News had a conservative bias  and    percent that it had a liberal bias  It found    percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias  compared with    percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and    percent who said the same of CNN       David Carr  media critic for The New York Times  praised the      presidential election results coverage on Fox News for the network s response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor Karl Rove challenging its call that Barack Obama would win Ohio and the election  Fox s prediction was correct  Carr wrote   Over many months  Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop  that President Obama was a clear failure  that a majority of Americans saw  Mitt  Romney as a good alternative in hard times  and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed  But on Tuesday night  the people in charge of Fox News were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that Mr  Romney had fallen short  was Fox  first and foremost  a place for advocacy or a place for news  In this moment  at least  Fox chose news       A May      study conducted by Harvard University s Shorenstein Center on Media  Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of Trump s first     days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox       It found Trump received     negative coverage from the overall media  and received the least negative coverage on Fox       negative and     positive       On March           Andrew Napolitano  a Fox News commentator  claimed on Fox   Friends that British intelligence agency GCHQ had wiretapped Trump on behalf of Barack Obama during the      United States presidential election            On March           White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeated the claim       When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference  he said  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television  I didn t make an opinion on it        On March           Shepard Smith  a Fox News anchor  admitted the network had no evidence that Trump was under surveillance  British officials said the White House was backing off the claim       Napolitano was later suspended by Fox News for making the claim       In June       Fox News executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators       The instructions came after a number of Fox News hosts and guests made incendiary comments about the Trump administration s policy of separating migrant children from their parents       Fox News host Laura Ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to  summer camps   Guest Corey Lewandowski mocked the story of a    year old child with Down syndrome being separated from her mother  the Fox News host did not address Lewandowski s statement       Guest Ann Coulter falsely claimed that the separated children were  child actors   the Fox News host did not challenge her claim       In a segment on Trump s alleged use of racial dog whistles  one Fox News contributor told an African American whom he was debating   You re out of your cotton picking mind        According to the      book Asymmetric Politics by political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A  Hopkins   Fox News tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving Democrats that receive scant attention in other media  such as the relationship between Barack Obama and William Ayers     Hillary Clinton s role in the fatal      attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi  Libya  the gun running scandal known as  Fast and Furious   the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient Solyndra  the past activism of Obama White House operative Van Jones  the      attacks on John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  the controversial sermons of Obama s Chicago pastor Jeremiah Wright  the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group ACORN  and the  war on Christmas  supposedly waged every December by secular  multicultural liberals        In October       Fox News ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between Trump supporting rapper Kanye West and President Trump in the Oval Office  Fox News had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with Democratic politicians and causes  such as when Fox News ran headlines describing conscious hip hop artist Common as  vile  and a  cop killer rapper   and when Fox News ran negative coverage of Kanye West before he became a Trump supporter       On November          Trump s website  DonaldJTrump com  announced in a press release that Fox News host Sean Hannity would make a  special guest appearance  with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau  Missouri       The following morning  Hannity tweeted  To be clear  I will not be on stage campaigning with the President        Hannity appeared at the president s lectern on stage at the rally  immediately mocking the  fake news  at the back of the auditorium  Fox News reporters among them  Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity s actions  with one stating   a new line was crossed        Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre planned  and Fox News stated it  does not condone any talent participating in campaign events        Fox News host Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally  The Trump press release was later removed from Trump s website            Fox News released a poll of registered voters  jointly conducted by two polling organizations  on June           The poll found some unfavorable results for Trump  including a record high     thought the Trump campaign had coordinated with the Russian government  and     thought he should be impeached       saying he should also be removed from office   while     said they did not favor impeachment            The next morning on Fox   Friends First  host Heather Childers twice misrepresented the poll results  stating  a new Fox News poll shows most voters don t want impeachment  and  at least half of U S  voters do not think President Trump should be impeached   while the on screen display of the actual poll question was also incorrect  Later that morning on America s Newsroom  the on screen display showed the correct poll question and results  but highlighted the     of respondents who opposed impeachment rather than the     who supported it  the latter being broken out into two figures   As host Bill Hemmer drew guest Byron York s attention to the     opposed figure  they did not discuss the     support figure  while the on screen chyron read   Fox News Poll      Support Trump s Impeachment and Removal      Oppose        Later that day  Trump tweeted   FoxNews Polls are always bad for me   Something weird going on at Fox        In April       it became known that former Obama administration national security advisor Susan Rice sought the unmasking of Trump associates who were unidentified in intelligence reports  notably Trump s incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn  during the presidential transition       In May       acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell  a Trump loyalist  declassified a list of Obama administration officials who had also requested unmasking of Trump associates  which was subsequently publicly released by Republican senators       That month  attorney general Bill Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Bash to examine the unmaskings       Fox News primetime hosts declared the unmaskings a  domestic spying operation  for which the Obama administration was  exposed  in the  biggest abuse of power  in American history       The Bash inquiry closed months later with no findings of substantive wrongdoing       However  certain Fox personalities have not had as much of a favorable reception from Trump  news anchors Shepard Smith  who retired from Fox in       and Chris Wallace have been criticised by Trump for allegedly being adversarial            alongside Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano  who said Trump s actions in the Trump Ukraine scandal were  both criminal and impeachable behavior        Trump was also critical of the network hiring former DNC chair Donna Brazile  in            The relationship between Trump and Fox News   and other Rupert Murdoch controlled outlets   soured following the      U S  presidential election as Trump refused to concede that Joe Biden had been elected President elect            This negative tonal shift led to increased viewership of Newsmax and One America News among Trump and his supporters due to their increased antipathy towards Fox                      and as a result  Fox released promotional videos of their opinion hosts disputing the election results  promoting a Trump affiliated conspiracy theory about voter fraud        Coverage of Russia investigation Further information  Special Counsel investigation             On October           when special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates  and revealed George Papadopoulos had plead guilty  all of whom were involved in the Trump      campaign   this was the focus of most media s coverage  except Fox News        Hosts and guests on Fox News called for Mueller to be fired            Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that Clinton sold uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation and on the Clinton campaign s role in funding the Donald Trump Russia dossier            Hannity asserted   The very thing they are accusing President Trump of doing  they did it themselves        During the segment  Hannity mistakenly referred to Clinton as President Clinton            Fox News dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story  which Democrats said was an attempt to distract from Mueller s intensifying investigation            CNN described the coverage as  a tour de force in deflection and dismissal        On October     CNN reported Fox News employees were dissatisfied with their outlet s coverage of the Russia investigation  with employees calling it an  embarrassment    laughable  and saying it  does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country  and that it is  another blow to journalists at Fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way             When the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the      presidential election intensified in October       the focus of Fox News coverage turned  what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of President Trump s political opponents  In reports like these  Bill and Hillary Clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the Russians to undermine American democracy        Paul Waldman of the Washington Post described the coverage as  No puppet  You re the puppet   saying it was a  careful  coordinated  and comprehensive strategy  to distract from Mueller s investigation       German Lopes of Vox said Fox News  coverage has reached  levels of self parody  as it dedicated coverage to low key stories  such as a controversial Newsweek op ed and hamburger emojis  while other networks had wall to wall coverage of Mueller s indictments       A FiveThirtyEight analysis of Russia related media coverage in cable news found most mentions of Russia on Fox News were spoken in close proximity to  uranium  and  dossier        On November          Vox analyzed the transcripts of Fox News  CNN and MSNBC  and found Fox News  was unable to talk about the Mueller investigation without bringing up Hillary Clinton    talked significantly less about George Papadopoulos   the Trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with Mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the Russian government s efforts to help Trump   than its competitors   and  repeatedly called Mueller s credibility into question        In December       Fox News escalated its attacks on the Mueller investigation  with hosts and guest commentators suggesting the investigation amounted to a coup                           Guest co host Kevin Jackson referred to a right wing conspiracy theory claiming Strzok s messages are evidence of a plot by FBI agents to assassinate Trump  a claim which the other Fox co hosts quickly said is not supported by any credible evidence            Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called the Mueller investigation team a  criminal cabal  and said the team ought to be arrested       Other Fox News figures referred to the investigation as  corrupt    crooked  and  illegitimate   and likened the FBI to the KGB  the Soviet era spy organization that routinely tortured and summarily executed people       Political scientists and scholars of coups described the Fox News rhetoric as scary and dangerous       Experts on coups rejected that the Mueller investigation amounted to a coup  rather  the Fox News rhetoric was dangerous to democracy and mirrored the kind of rhetoric that occurs before purges       A number of observers argued the Fox News rhetoric was intended to discredit the Mueller investigation and sway President Donald Trump to fire Mueller       In August       Fox News was criticized for giving more prominent coverage of a murder committed by an undocumented immigrant than the convictions of Donald Trump s former campaign manager  Paul Manafort  and his long term personal attorney  Michael Cohen       At the same time  most other national mainstream media gave wall to wall coverage of the convictions       Fox News hosts Dana Perrino and Jason Chaffetz argued that voters care far more about the murder than the convictions of the President s former top aides  and hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity downplayed the convictions                  False claims about other media CNN s Jake Tapper In November       following the      New York City truck attack wherein a terrorist shouted  Allahu Akbar   Fox News distorted a statement by Jake Tapper to make it appear as if he had said  Allahu Akbar  can be used under the most  beautiful circumstances        Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of  Allahu Akbar  in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances       A headline on FoxNews com was preceded by a tag reading  OUTRAGEOUS        The Fox News Twitter account distorted the statement even more  saying  Jake Tapper Says  Allahu Akbar  Is  Beautiful  Right After NYC Terror Attack  in a tweet that was later deleted       Tapper chastised Fox News for choosing to  deliberately lie  and said  there was a time when one could tell the difference between Fox and the nutjobs at Infowars  It s getting tougher and tougher  Lies are lies        Tapper had in       while a White House correspondent for ABC News  come to the defense of Fox News when Obama criticized the network for not being a legitimate news organization       Fox News guest host Jason Chaffetz apologized to Tapper for misrepresenting his statement       After Fox News had deleted the tweet  Sean Hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called Tapper  liberal fake news CNN s fake Jake Tapper  and mocked his ratings             The New York Times In July       a report by Fox   Friends falsely said The New York Times had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped Abu Bakr al Baghdadi  the leader of the Islamic State  to evade capture       The report cited an inaccurate assertion by Gen  Tony Thomas  the head of the United States Special Operations Command  that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence            Fox News said it was The New York Times  repeatedly running the chyron  NYT Foils U S  Attempt To Take Out Al Bahgdadi        Pete Hegseth  one of the show s hosts  criticized the  failing New York Times        President Donald Trump tweeted about the Fox   Friends report shortly after it first aired  saying  The Failing New York Times foiled U S  attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist  Al Baghdadi  Their sick agenda over National Security        Fox News later updated the story  but without apologizing to the New York Times or responding directly to the inaccuracies       In a Washington Post column  Erik Wemple said Chris Wallace had covered The New York Times story himself on Fox News Sunday   Here s another case of the differing standards between Fox News s opinion operation   which has given  a state run vibe on all matters related to Trump   compared to Fox News s news operation  which has provided  mostly sane coverage         Climate change Further information  Media coverage of climate change and Climate change denial Fox News has often been described as a major platform for climate change denial                      According to the fact checking website Climate Feedback  Fox News is part of  a network of unreliable outlets for climate news        A      study found Fox News  takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC        A      study found Fox News emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than CNN  was less likely to say climate change was real  and more likely to interview climate change skeptics       Leaked emails showed that in      Bill Sammon  the Fox News Washington managing editor  instructed Fox News journalists to dispute the scientific consensus on climate change   refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed  or cooled  in any given period without IMMEDIATELY pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question        According to climate scientist Michael E  Mann  Fox News  has constructed an alternative universe where the laws of physics no longer apply  where the greenhouse effect is a myth  and where climate change is a hoax  the product of a massive conspiracy among scientists  who somehow have gotten the polar bears  glaciers  sea levels  superstorms  and megadroughts to play along        According to James Lawrence Powell s      study of the climate science denial movement  Fox News provides  the deniers with a platform to say whatever they like without fear of contradiction        Fox News employs Steve Milloy  a prominent climate change denier with close financial and organizational ties to oil companies  as a contributor  In his columns about climate change for FoxNews com  Fox News has failed to disclose his substantial funding from oil companies       In       the hosts of Fox   Friends described climate change as  unproven science   a  disputed fact   and criticized the Department of Education for working together with the children s network Nickelodeon to teach children about climate change       In       Sean Hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as  phony science from the left        In       he falsely alleged   scientists still can t agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction        In       Hannity said the so called  Climategate    the leaking of e mails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing   a  scandal  that  exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists        Hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows       In       a widely shared Fox News news report falsely claimed that new climate science research showed that the Earth might be heading to a new Ice Age  the author of the study that Fox News cited said that Fox News  utterly misrepresents our research  and the study did not in any way suggest that Earth was heading to an Ice Age  Fox News later corrected the story       Shepard Smith has drawn attention for being one of few voices on Fox News to forcefully state that climate change is real  that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue            His acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change has drawn criticism from Fox News viewers and conservatives             Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy See also  Murder of Seth Rich On May           a day when other news organizations were extensively covering Donald Trump s revelation of classified information to Russia       Fox News ran a lead story about a private investigator s uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich  a DNC staffer                 The private investigator said he had uncovered evidence that Rich was in contact with Wikileaks and law enforcement were covering it up       The killing of Rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in rightwing circles that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the DNC leaks       U S  intelligence agencies determined Russia was the source of the leaks       In reporting the investigator s claims  the Fox News report reignited right wing conspiracy theories about the killing            The Fox News story fell apart within hours       Other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to NBC News  developed a reputation for making outlandish claims  such as one appearance on Fox News in      in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol toting lesbian gangs were raping young women             The family of Seth Rich  the Washington D C  police department  the Washington D C  mayor s office  the FBI  and law enforcement sources familiar with the case rebuked the investigator s claims            Rich s relatives said   We are a family who is committed to facts  not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth s murderers        The spokesperson for the family criticized Fox News for its reporting  alleging the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump Russia story   I think there s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda        The family has called for retractions and apologies from Fox News for the inaccurate reporting            Over the course of the day  Fox News altered the contents of the story and the headline  but did not issue corrections            When CNN contacted the private investigator later that day  the investigator said he had no evidence that Rich had contacted Wikileaks       The investigator claimed he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a Fox News reporter       Fox News did not respond to inquiries by CNN  and the Washington Post            Fox News later on    May  seven days after the story was published  retracted its original report  saying the original report did not meet its standards            Nicole Hemmer  then assistant professor at the Miller Center of Public Affairs  wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how Fox News was  remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of Trump  blurring the lines between real and fake news        Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations said while intent behind Fox News  as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable  the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths  of which the promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy is an example       Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets  such as the Weekly Standard       National Review            and conservative columnists  such as Jennifer Rubin       Michael Gerson       and John Podhoretz       Rich s parents  Joel and Mary Rich  sued Fox News for the emotional distress it had caused them by its false reporting   In       Fox News settled with Rich family  making a payment that was not officially disclosed but which was reported to be in the seven figures       Although the settlement had been agreed to earlier in the year  Fox News arranged to delay the public announcement until after the      presidential election        Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville Further information  Unite the Right rally Fox News hosts and contributors defended Trump s remarks that  many sides  were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville  Virginia            Some criticized Trump            In a press conference on August     Trump used the term  alt left  to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally  a term which had been used in Fox News  coverage of the white supremacist rally       Several of Trump s comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News       According to Dylan Byers of CNN  Fox News  coverage on the day of the press conference  was heavy with  whataboutism   The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media s criticism of Trump and leftist protestors  toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president s apparent defense of bigotry        Byers wrote   it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump s presidency  it was not crossed on Tuesday         Glenn Beck s comments about George Soros During Glenn Beck s tenure at Fox News  he became one of the most high profile proponents of conspiracy theories about George Soros  a Jewish Hungarian American businessman and philanthropist known for his donations to American liberal political causes       Beck regularly described Soros as a  puppet master  and used common anti Semitic tropes to describe Soros and his activities       In a      three part series  Beck depicted George Soros as a cartoonish villain trying to  form a shadow government  using humanitarian aid as a cover   and that Soros wanted a one world government            Beck promoted the false and anti Semitic conspiracy theory that Soros was a Nazi collaborator as a    year old in Nazi occupied Hungary       Beck also characterized Soros s mother as a  wildly anti Semitic  Nazi collaborator       According to The Washington Post   Beck s series was largely considered obscene and delusional  if not outright anti Semitic   but Beck s conspiracy theory became common on the rightwing of American politics       Amid criticism of Beck s false smears  Fox News defended Beck  stating  information regarding Mr  Soros s experiences growing up were taken directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the media  and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a child             Roger Ailes  then head of Fox News  dismissed criticism levied at Beck by hundreds of rabbis  saying that they were  left wing rabbis who basically don t think that anybody can ever use the word  Holocaust  on the air         COVID    pandemic Main articles  Fox News coverage of the COVID    pandemic and Media coverage of the COVID    pandemic During the first few weeks of the COVID    pandemic s spread into the United States  Fox News was considerably more likely than other mainstream news outlets to promote misinformation about coronavirus       The network promoted the narrative that the emergency response to the pandemic was politically motivated or otherwise unwarranted       with Sean Hannity explicitly calling it a  hoax   he later denied doing so  and other hosts downplaying it       This coverage was consistent with the messaging of Trump at the time       Only in mid March did the network change the tone of its coverage       after President Trump declared a national emergency       Two of Fox News s commentators   Hannity and Laura Ingraham   promoted use of the drug hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of Coronavirus   off label usage which at the time was supported only by anecdotal evidence   after it was touted by Trump as a possible cure       As a result of this continued skewed reporting  Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple has called Hannity to be fired       Fox News promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus death toll numbers were inflated with people who would have died anyway from preexisting conditions  This was refuted by White House coronavirus task force members Dr  Anthony Fauci and Dr  Deborah Birx  with Fauci describing conspiracy theories as  nothing but distractions  during public health crises       In a USA Today article   Coronavirus  How Fox News and other right wing media endanger our health   the author cited as an example  a Fox News interview with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton who raised the  escaped virus conspiracy theory  by saying the coronavirus may have started in a  biosafety level   super laboratory  in Wuhan  China  The article said that Cotton had mentioned the  debunked theory  on  at least two other times on Fox             Several weeks later Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin detailed a      trip made to the Wuhan Institute of Virology by scientists from the U S  Embassy  Rogin cited cables sent back to Washington  warning  about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and that the lab s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS like pandemic        Rogin s article quoted Xiao Qiang  a research scientist at the University of California  Berkeley   I don t think it s a conspiracy theory  I think it s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered        Days later  multiple media outlets confirmed that U S  intelligence officials were investigating the possibility that the virus started in the same lab Cotton cited during the Fox News interview                      At the same time that Fox News commentators downplayed the threat of the virus in public  Fox s management and the Murdoch family took a broad range of internal measures to protect themselves and their employees against it                           According to a study published at BMJ Global

political  and speculated they were made  because we are conservative        Bill O Reilly and Fox News settled six agreements  totaling     million  with women who accused O Reilly of sexual harassment            In January       shortly after Bill O Reilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for     million   an extraordinarily large amount for such cases    Fox News renewed Bill O Reilly s contract       Fox News s parent company    st Century Fox  said it was aware of the lawsuit       The contract between O Reilly and Fox News read he could not be fired from the network unless sexual harassment allegations were proved in court       Fox News s extensive coverage of the Harvey Weinstein scandal in October      was seen by some as hypocritical            Fox News dedicated at least    hours of coverage to the Weinstein scandal  yet only dedicated    minutes to Bill O Reilly  who just like Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women            Indira Lakshmana  an expert in journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute  said  to devote hours of airtime to crowing about Weinstein s well deserved downfall because of his liberal politics  while ignoring the massive  decades long pattern of harassment by powerful men at Fox  is both hypocritical and sad        A few weeks later  when a number of women under the age of     including a    year old  accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making sexual advances  Hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his TV show to casting doubt on the accusers            Other prime time Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham queried The Washington Post s reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Louis C K       Fox News figures Jeanine Pirro and Gregg Jarrett questioned both the validity of The Washington Post s reporting and that of the women       In December       a few days before the Alabama Senate election  Fox News  along with the conspiracy websites Breitbart and Gateway Pundit  ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of Roy Moore s accusers admitted to forging an inscription by Roy Moore in her yearbook  Fox News later added a correction to the story       A number of Fox News hosts have welcomed Bill O Reilly to their shows and paid tributes to Roger Ailes after his death  In May       Hannity called Ailes  a second father  and said to Ailes s  enemies  that he was  preparing to kick your a   in the next life        Ailes had the year before been fired from Fox News after women alleged he sexually harassed them       In September       several months after Bill O Reilly was fired from Fox News in the wake of women alleging he sexually harassed them  Hannity hosted O Reilly on his show                 Some Fox News employees criticized the decision       According to CNN  during the interview  Hannity found kinship with O Reilly as he appeared  to feel that he and O Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them        Earlier  Hannity had dedicated extensive coverage to the Weinstein scandal        Obama administration conflict In September       the Obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel  On September     President Barack Obama appeared on all major news programs except Fox News  a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Fox coverage of Obama s health care proposal            In late September       Obama s senior advisor David Axelrod and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps  Two weeks later  White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel referred to FNC as  not a news network  and communications director Anita Dunn said  Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party             Obama observed   If media is operating basically as a talk radio format  then that s one thing  and if it s operating as a news outlet  then that s another        Emanuel said it was important  to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox        Within days  it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official Ken Feinberg  with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool  ABC  CBS  NBC  and CNN  coming to Fox s defense       A bureau chief said   If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing  it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues        Shortly after the story broke  the White House admitted to a low level mistake  saying Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg  Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett said he had not made a specific request  but had a  standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made        On November          the Los Angeles Times reported an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again  According to the article  Dunn claimed in an e mail to have checked with colleagues who  deal with TV issues  who denied telling anyone to avoid Fox  Patrick Caddell  a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Jimmy Carter  said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House       On October          Fox News host Anna Kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the National Report parody site  which claimed Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket                  Journalistic ethical standards Fox News attracted controversy in April      when it was revealed primetime host Sean Hannity had defended Trump s then personal attorney Michael Cohen on air without disclosing Cohen was Hannity s lawyer       On April          federal agents from the U S  Attorney s office served a search warrant on Cohen s office and residence       On the air  Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action  calling it  highly questionable  and  an unprecedented abuse of power        On April           in a court hearing  Cohen s lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in           but did  traditional legal tasks  for only three  Trump  Elliott Broidy  and a  prominent person  who did not wish to be named for fear of being  embarrassed                  The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client  whom Cohen s lawyers named as Hannity       Hannity was not sanctioned by Fox News for this breach of journalistic ethics  with Fox News releasing a statement that the channel was unaware of Hannity s relationship to Cohen and that it had  spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support                       Media ethics experts said that Hannity s disclosure failure was a major breach of journalistic ethics and that the network should have suspended or fired him for it

Canada  which would have featured a mixture of U S  and Canadian news programming  As a result  the CRTC denied a      application requesting permission for Fox News Channel to be carried in Canada

  United Kingdom and Ireland FNC was carried in the United Kingdom by Sky  which was    percent owned by   st Century Fox at the time  and operates its own domestic news channel Sky News  On August           Sky dropped Fox News  the broadcaster said its carriage was not  commercially viable  due to average viewership of fewer than       viewers per day  The company said the decision was unrelated to   st Century Fox s proposed acquisition of the remainder of Sky plc  which ultimately led to a bidding war that resulted in its acquisition by Comcast instead        The potential co ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal  who felt Sky News could similarly undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right wing viewpoint  However  such a move would violate Ofcom broadcast codes  which requires all news programming to show due impartiality  The channel s broadcasts in the country have violated this rule on several occasions  while the channel also violated election silence rules by broadcasting analysis of the      Brexit referendum while polls were still open  the channel was blacked out while polls were open during the      general election to comply with the rule                        Notable personalities Program hosts  Bret Baier Maria Bartiromo Jedediah Bila Shannon Bream Will Cain Tucker Carlson Neil Cavuto Lou Dobbs Steve Doocy Ainsley Earhardt
