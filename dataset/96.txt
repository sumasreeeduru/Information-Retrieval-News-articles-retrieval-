other functions  whether they be institution based  academy based  or independent self taught  Such a magazine can be published in print  online  or both  and may be aimed at different audiences  including galleries  buyers  amateur or professional artists  and the general public  In short  art magazines can be either trade or consumer magazines  or both  There are also radio and TV features
