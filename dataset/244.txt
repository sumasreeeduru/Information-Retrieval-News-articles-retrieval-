       Strong objectivity  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search  Strong objectivity is a term coined by feminist philosopher Sandra Harding  known for her work on feminist standpoint theory  Harding suggests that starting research from the lives of women  actually strengthens standards of objectivity      Strong objectivity can be contrasted with the  weak objectivity  of supposed value neutral research     Strong objectivity is posited in contrast to scientific objectivity since strong objectivity amplifies researcher bias  something that Harding argues can never really be removed     a researcher s life experiences will always be a lens through which they view the world and subsequently their research   From a feminist standpoint  the question of objectivity stems from what kinds of knowledge projects are objective and which aren t  and why  whether or not objectivity is necessary  and how  or if  it is possible to achieve objectivity  These considerations arise at least in part from concerns about sexism and androcentric bias in dominant scientific life and studies  Strong objectivity argues that there is androcentric bias in research because male researchers attempt to be a neutral researcher  where Harding argues that is not possible     Harding suggests researcher reflexivity  or consideration of the researcher s positionality  and how that affects their research  as a  stronger  objectivity than researchers claiming to be completely neutral  Knowledge and the biases affecting it must be equally judged by the scientific community and located in social history      See also edit  Relativism Standpoint theory View from nowhere References edit     Tickner  J Ann        You Just Don t Understand  Troubled  Engagements between Feminists and IR Theorists  International Studies Quartlery               Ritzer  George  ed   Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology  Blackwell Publishing        Blackwell Reference Online    January       http   www blackwellreference com public book id g              yr                      a b Harding  Sandra   Rethinking Standpoint Epistemology  What is  Strong Objectivity   Feminist Theory  A Philosophical Anthology  Ed  Cudd  Ann E  and Robin O  Andreasen        Oxford  Blackwell Publishing     Ramazanoglu  Caroline  Holland  Janet         Feminist Methodology  Challenges and Choices  Thousand Oaks  SAGE  pp         ISBN               Further reading edit  Harding  Sandra        Whose Science  Whose Knowledge  Thinking from Women s Lives  Ithaca  NY  Cornell University Press    This feminism related article is a stub  You can help Wikipedia by expanding it vte     Retrieved from  https   en wikipedia org w index php title Strong objectivity oldid            Categories  Feminist terminologyFeminist theoryFeminism stubsHidden categories  Use dmy dates from August     All stub articles       Navigation menu     Personal tools   Not logged inTalkContributionsCreate accountLog in       Namespaces   ArticleTalk       Variants           Views   ReadEditView history       More        Search                    Navigation   Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate      Contribute   HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file      Tools   What links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageWikidata item      Print export   Download as PDFPrintable version      Languages         Edit links        This page was last edited on   May       at        UTC   Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License  additional terms may apply   By using this site  you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy  Wikipedia  is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation  Inc   a non profit organization    Privacy policy About Wikipedia Disclaimers Contact Wikipedia Mobile view Developers Statistics Cookie statement
