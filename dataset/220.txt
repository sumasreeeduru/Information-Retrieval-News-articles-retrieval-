landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon  This includes both crewed and robotic missions  The first human made object to touch the Moon was the Soviet Union s Luna    on    September          The United States  Apollo    was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon  on    July          There were six crewed U S  landings between      and       and numerous uncrewed landings  with no soft landings happening between    August      and    December       The United States is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon  with the last departing the lunar surface in December       All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until   January       when the Chinese Chang e   spacecraft made the first landing on the far

with a drawing of the first soft landed probe Luna    next to the first view of the lunar surface photographed by the probe  After the unsuccessful attempt by Luna   to land on the Moon in       the Soviet Union performed the first hard Moon landing    hard  meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon   later that same year with the Luna   spacecraft  a feat the U S  duplicated in      with Ranger    Since then  twelve Soviet and U S  spacecraft have used braking rockets  retrorockets  to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface  between      and       In      the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna   and Luna    missions  The U S  followed with five uncrewed Surveyor soft landings  The Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil sample return with the Luna    probe on    September       This was followed by Luna    and Luna    in      and       respectively  Following the failure at launch in      of the first Lunokhod  Luna E   No      the Luna    and Luna    were successful uncrewed lunar rover missions in      and       Many missions were failures at launch  In addition  several uncrewed landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful  including  Luna     Luna     and Luna    all crashed on landing  and the U S  Surveyor   lost all radio contact only moments before its landing  More recently  other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around       kilometres per hour        mph   often at precise  planned locations  These have generally been end of life lunar orbiters that  because of system degradations  could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations   masscons   to maintain their orbit  Japan s lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon s surface on    April       The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART   on   September       Indian Space Research Organisation  ISRO  performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe  MIP  on    November       The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan   lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface  The Chinese lunar orbiter Chang e   executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on   March       The rover mission Chang e   soft landed on    December       as did its successor  Chang e    on   January       All crewed and uncrewed soft landings had taken place on the near side of the Moon  until   January      when the Chinese Chang e   spacecraft made the first landing on the far side of the Moon     On    February       Israeli private space agency SpaceIL launched spacecraft Beresheet on board a Falcon   from Cape Canaveral  Florida with the intention of achieving a soft landing  SpaceIL lost contact with the spacecraft and it crashed into the surface on    April          Indian Space Research Organization launched Chandrayaan   on    July      with landing scheduled on   September       However  at an altitude of     km from the Moon a few minutes before soft landing  the lander lost contact with the control room      Crewed landings edit  Further information  Apollo program  The view through the window of the Lunar Module Orion shortly after Apollo    s landing  A total of twelve men have landed on the Moon  This was accomplished with two US pilot astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a    month period starting    July       with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo     and ending on    December      with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo     Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface  All Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the command module  The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover  the Lunar Roving Vehicle  for increased mobility   Scientific background edit  To get to the Moon  a spacecraft must first leave Earth s gravity well  currently  the only practical means is a rocket  Unlike airborne vehicles such as balloons and jets  a rocket can continue accelerating in the vacuum outside the atmosphere  Upon approach of the target moon  a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity  In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about     kilometres per hour     mph  and be ruggedized to withstand a  hard landing  impact  or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a  soft landing   the only option for humans   The first three attempts by the U S  to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in      all failed     The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in       followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U S  The speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between    and      of the escape velocity of the target moon  and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon s gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur  For Earth s Moon  the escape velocity is      kilometres per second       mi s      The change in velocity  referred to as a delta v  is usually provided by a landing rocket  which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft  An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in       As the moon with the thickest atmosphere  landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability  The Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in           Crash landings     may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft  or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket  There have been many such Moon crashes  often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface  For example  during the Apollo program the S IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the Lunar Module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface  Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon  To return to Earth  the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon  Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space  Upon reaching Earth  atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing  citation needed  These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations  Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon s surface by a moon landing rocket  increasing the latter s required size  The Moon departure rocket  larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle  greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree   Political background edit  Main article  Space Race This section has multiple issues  Please help improve it or discuss these

easier to understand in the political context of its historical era  World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and Finland  and in the attack on Pearl Harbor  the V   rocket  a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp  and the atom bomb  which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  In the     s  tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict  particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb    The first image of another world from space  returned by Luna    showed the far side of the Moon in October       Willy Ley wrote in      that a rocket to the Moon  could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers       On   October       the Soviet Union launched Sputnik   as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race  This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U S   who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear tipped Soviet rockets in under    minutes  citation needed  Also  the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik   as it passed overhead every    minutes was widely viewed on both sides citation needed  as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U S  This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid fire Soviet space achievements  In       the R   rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth s gravity into a solar orbit  the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon  and the first photography of the never before seen far side of the Moon  These were the Luna    Luna    and Luna   spacecraft    A      conceptual model of the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module The U S  response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency  NASA  Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles  ICBMs  that would bridge the so called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD  These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects  which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload  guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U S  ICBMs to the Soviets   While NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets  their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic  goal oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure  citation needed  just as the Soviets were doing with their R     Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions             edit  After the fall of the Soviet Union in       historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts  Unlike the U S  tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch  the Soviets assigned a public  Luna  mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit  The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view  If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon  it was frequently  but not always  given a  Sputnik  or  Cosmos  Earth orbit mission number to hide its purpose  Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all     Mission  Mass  kg   Launch vehicle

 Artist s portrayal of a Ranger spacecraft right before impact  One of the last photos of the Moon transmitted by Ranger   right before impact In contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in       success eluded initial U S  efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs  Fifteen consecutive U S  uncrewed lunar missions over a six year period from      to      all failed their primary photographic missions          however  Rangers   and   successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions          Failures included three U S  attempts            in      to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft  These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing  unlike the parent vehicle  which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface  The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between

the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of   milliradian to study the Moon s surface  an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space  a diaphragm microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites  a magnetometer  and temperature variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions  The first  a mission managed by the United States Air Force  exploded during launch  all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization  The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around         kilometres         mi  and       kilometres      mi   far short of the roughly         kilometres          mi  required to reach the vicinity of the Moon  NASA then collaborated with the United States Army s Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone shaped probes on the Juno ICBM  carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger M ller tube detector  The first of these reached an altitude of only around         kilometres         mi   serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth s atmosphere  The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than        kilometres         mi   twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on board scientific instruments  yet still becoming the first U S  spacecraft to reach a solar orbit  The final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four  paddlewheel  solar panels extending from a one meter diameter spherical spin stabilized spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television like system  estimate the Moon s mass and topography of the poles  record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites  study radiation  measure magnetic fields  detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well  None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage  Following the unsuccessful Atlas Able Pioneer probes  NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions  The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners  lunar versions were Rangers  JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes  Block I prototypes  which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon  Block II  which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package  and Block III  which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide area photographs of the Moon during their descent   Ranger missions edit  See also  Ranger program The Ranger   and   Block I missions were virtually identical          Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman alpha telescope  a rubidium vapor magnetometer  electrostatic analyzers  medium energy range particle detectors  two triple coincidence telescopes  a cosmic ray integrating ionization chamber  cosmic dust detectors  and scintillation counters  The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of         kilometres         mi  and a perigee of        kilometres         mi       From that vantage point  scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances  Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one shot fifteen minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents  Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch  both burned up upon reentry after only a few days  The first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in      during the Rangers      and   missions flown by the United States             All three Block II missions basic vehicles were     m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact limiter      mm in diameter  a mono propellant mid course motor  a retrorocket with a thrust of       pounds force       kN       and a gold  and chrome plated hexagonal base     m in diameter  This lander  code named Tonto  was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon  A    kg     pounds     centimetre diameter       ft  metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere  citation needed     Everything that we do ought to really be tied in to getting onto the Moon ahead of the Russians     We re ready to spend reasonable amounts of money  but we re talking about fantastic expenditures which wreck our budget and all these other domestic programs  and the only justification for it  in my opinion  to do it is because we hope to beat them and demonstrate that starting behind  as we did by a couple of years  by God  we passed them     John F  Kennedy on the planned Moon landing     November            This payload sphere contained six silver cadmium batteries to power a fifty milliwatt radio transmitter  a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures  and a seismometer designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a   lb      kg  meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon  Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere  After landing  plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere  The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere  Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator  which the lander ideally would reach    hours after launch  No cameras were carried by the Ranger landers  and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission  Instead  the     metres     ft  Ranger Block II mother ship carried a     scan line television camera which was to capture images during the free fall descent to the lunar surface  The camera was designed to transmit a picture every    seconds      Seconds before impact  at   and     kilometres       and      mi  above the lunar surface  the Ranger mother ships took picture  which may be viewed here   Other instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter  The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship  The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at     metres        ft  above the surface and separate  allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface  citation needed  On Ranger    failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon  Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in flight failure of the onboard flight computer  This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for    hours on the ground  to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms  Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger   and the power subsystem on Ranger    Only Ranger   reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon  citation needed  Heat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes  citation needed  These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier  more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions  Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high altitude photographs in the final twenty minute period before crashing on the lunar surface  Camera resolution was       scan lines  far higher than the     lines found in a typical U S       home television  While Ranger   suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight  the subsequent Ranger   mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success  Breaking the six year string of failures in U S  attempts to photograph the Moon at close range  the Ranger   mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key      NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program  Subsequent successes with

     the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with uncrewed spacecraft  To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon  These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight  However  the Luna   hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a    kilometre per hour     mph  ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed      Ranger landing attempts and their planned     kilometre per hour     mph  impacts than with the Surveyor   soft landing on three footpads using its radar controlled  adjustable thrust retrorocket  While Luna   and Surveyor   were both major national accomplishments  only Surveyor   had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight  Thus as of mid       the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so called Space Race to land a man on the Moon    A timeline of the space race between      and       with missions from the US and USSR  Advances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon  Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit  Ranger  Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit  Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one way trip  In contrast  crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew  Leaving this massive amount of required Earth return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again  working against lunar gravity both ways  Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a crewed Moon landing  Accordingly  beginning in mid      both the U S  and U S S R  naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing  The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and  for the Soviets  the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings  An unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon s maria  Such mass concentrations   mascons   can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe  Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low altitude satellites around the Moon  making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years  Controlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value  For example  in      the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole  It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth  No such plume was observed  However  a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor   currently when   the only human remains on the Moon   Soviet lunar orbit satellites             edit    U S S R  mission  Mass  kg   Booster  Launched  Mission goal

possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit  following the so called free return trajectory  Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required  However  a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low Earth orbit mission  offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing  Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re entering the Earth s atmosphere upon returning from the Moon  Inhabited Earth orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around       m s         km h   Due to the effects of gravity  a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth s atmosphere at a much higher speed of around        m s         km h   The g loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry  Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force  Achieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program  The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes  after that  the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program  The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high speed reentry techniques  This focus was not shared by the U S   who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose  Initial crewed spaceflights in the early     s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U S  Mercury programs  A two flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in      and spacewalks in early       These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U S  in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout      and       using a totally new second generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury  These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile  After the end of the Gemini program  the Soviet Union began flying their second generation Zond crewed spacecraft in      with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth  The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket  unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N   booster  The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U S  human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory  However  significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U S  Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort  Like Zond  Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a service module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit  This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo    mission in       which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date  when      U S S R mission  Mass  kg   Booster  Launched  Mission goal  Payload  Mission result   Cosmos

Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean   Zond   was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return  initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of tortoises  insects  plants  and bacteria  Despite the failure suffered in its final moments  the Zond   mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well  Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements  both these Zond missions flew off nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans  As a result  the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated  However  due to NASA s continuing problems with the lunar module  and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late       NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo   from an Earth orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December       In early December      the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur  giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon  Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon  Ultimately  however  the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission  Their decision proved to be a wise one  since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later  By this time flights of the third generation U S  Apollo spacecraft had begun  Far more capable than the Zond  the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth  The Apollo   mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on    December       certifying the Saturn V booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth  Apollo    then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May       This mission orbited within        feet       km  of the lunar surface  performing necessary low altitude mapping of trajectory altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land  With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna    in July       the stage was set for Apollo      Human Moon landings             edit   The U S  Saturn V and the Soviet N   US strategy edit  Main article  Apollo program   Political pressure builds Plans for human Moon exploration began during the Eisenhower administration  In a series of mid     s articles in Collier s magazine  Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base  A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR  Besides guidance and weight management  atmospheric re entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle  After the Soviets launched Sputnik  von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by       After the early Soviet successes  especially Yuri Gagarin s flight  US President John F  Kennedy looked for a project that would capture the public imagination  He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership  The proposals included non space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World  The Soviets  at the time  had more powerful rockets than the US  which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission  Advances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller  lighter warheads  the Soviets  were much heavier  and the powerful R   rocket was developed to carry them  More modest missions such as flying around the Moon  or a space lab in lunar orbit  both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun   offered too much advantage to the Soviets  landing  however  would capture the world s imagination    Apollo landing sites Johnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik  sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator  When Kennedy asked him in      to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets  lead  Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing  but not for anything less  Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space  He ensured continuing funding  shielding space spending from the      tax cut  but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects  These diversions dismayed NASA s leader  James E  Webb  who perceived the need for NASA s support from the scientific community  The Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle  which achieved a perfect record  zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle caused mission failures in thirteen launches  For the program to succeed  its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left  more money for social programs  and on the right  more money for the military   By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance  Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion  by          percent of Americans favored Apollo  up from    percent two years earlier  After Johnson became President in       his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in       as Kennedy had planned   Soviet strategy edit  Main article  Soviet Moonshot Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October      the USSR was  not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon   while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race  Only after another year did the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon landing attempt  which ultimately failed  At the same time  Kennedy had suggested various joint programs  including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U S  astronauts and the development of better weather monitoring satellites  Khrushchev  sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology  rejected the idea  if the USSR went to the Moon  it would go alone  Sergey Korolev  the Soviet space program s chief designer  had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N  launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing  Khrushchev directed Korolev s design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology  while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft  the Proton booster and the Zond  for a human cislunar flight in       In      the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction  With Korolev s death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in       coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled  The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed Alexei Leonov on the Moon s surface  but with the successive launch failures of the N  booster in       plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation  A program of automated return vehicles was begun  in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks  This had several failures  It eventually succeeded with Luna         But this had little impact  because the Apollo    and Apollo    lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then   Apollo missions

launched the Beresheet lunar lander  developed by Israel s SpaceIL organization  Launched from Cape Canaveral  Florida on a Falcon   booster  with the lander being one of three payloads on the rocket  Beresheet arrived near the Moon using a slow but fuel efficient trajectory  Taking six weeks and several increasingly large orbits around the Earth  it first achieved a large elliptical orbit around Earth with an apogee near         kilometers          mi   At that point  with a short deceleration burn  it was caught by the Moon s gravity in a highly elliptical lunar orbit  an orbit which was circularized and reduced in diameter over a week s time  before attempting a landing on the Moon s surface on    April       The mission was the first Israeli  and the first privately funded  lunar landing attempt      SpaceIL was originally conceived in      as a venture to pursue the Google Lunar X Prize  On    April      Beresheet crashed on the surface of the Moon  as a result of a main engine failure in the final descent  The Beresheet lunar lander s target landing destination was within Mare Serenitatis  a vast volcanic basin on the Moon s northern near side  Despite the failure  the mission represents the closest a private entity has come to a soft lunar landing       Chandrayaan    India  edit  ISRO  the Indian National Space agency  launched Chandrayaan   on    July               It has   major modules  Orbiter  Lander and Rover  Each of these modules has scientific instruments from scientific research institutes in India and the US      The       kg        lb  spacecraft was launched by the GSLV Mk III      On   September      at      IST Chandryaan   s Vikram lander started the soft landing sequence  Contact was lost on     km      mi  above the lunar surface after the rough braking phase  and was not regained      From the images of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and chandrayaan orbiter it was found that the Vikram lander had crashed on the Moon and was destroyed   Landings on moons of other Solar System bodies edit  Progress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well  The Huygens probe of the Cassini Huygens mission to Saturn performed a successful moon landing on Titan in       Similarly  the Soviet probe Phobos   came within     mi      km  of performing a moon landing on Mars  moon Phobos in      before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost  A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos Grunt   grunt  means  soil  in Russian  launched in November       but stalled in low Earth orbit  There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter s moon Europa to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface       Current missions edit  China is planning to land and return lunar soil samples during the ongoing Chang e   mission      The Chang e   lander touched down on the surface of the Moon on December          Chandrayaan   is a planned third lunar exploration mission by Indian Space Research Organisation      The Lunar Polar Exploration Mission is a robotic space mission concept by the Indian Space Research Organisation  ISRO  and Japan s space agency JAXA         that would send a lunar rover and lander to explore south pole region of the Moon in                   JAXA is likely to provide launch service using the future H  rocket  along with responsibility for the rover  ISRO would be responsible for the lander           Proposed future missions edit  Main article  List of missions to the Moon   Proposed After the failure of the Vikram lander of Chandrayaan    India plans to re attempt a soft landing by Chandrayaan    which is scheduled to launch in November           Russia s Luna Glob    is expected to be launched in May                Historical empirical evidence edit  Main article  Moon landing conspiracy theories Many conspiracists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax      however  empirical evidence is readily available to show that human Moon landings did occur  Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo            and     verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon  In addition  in August      NASA s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites  These photos show the large descent stages of the six Apollo Lunar Modules which were left behind  the tracks of the three Lunar Roving Vehicles  and the paths left by the twelve astronauts as they walked in the lunar dust     In       then President of the United States  Barack Obama  acknowledged that the Moon landing was not a hoax and publicly thanked the members of the television show Mythbusters for publicly proving as much in season   episode         See also edit    Spaceflight portal List of Apollo astronauts Lunar Escape
