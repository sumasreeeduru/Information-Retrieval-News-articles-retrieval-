File on     Export Controls     Costing       million               it is the BBC s most expensive national radio network and is considered by many to be its flagship  There is no comparable British commercial network  Channel   abandoned plans to launch its own speech based digital radio station in October      as part of a     m cost cutting review      In       Mohit Bakaya replaced Gwyneth

related to various forms of both popular and classical music  and the long running music based Desert Island Discs  Prior to the creation of BBC Radio   it broadcast sports based features  notably Sport on Four  and since the creation of BBC Radio   Live in       the station has become the home of ball by ball commentaries of most Test cricket matches played by England  The coverage is broadcast on long wave  Consequently  for around    days a year  listeners have to rely on FM broadcasts or increasingly DAB for mainstream Radio   broadcasts   the number relying solely on long wave is now a small minority  The cricket broadcasts take precedence over on the hour news bulletins  but not the Shipping Forecast  carried since its move to long wave in      because that can be received

broadcast on medium wave with a network of VHF FM transmitters being added from       Radio   replaced it on    September       when the BBC renamed many of its domestic radio stations     in response to the challenge of offshore radio  It moved to long wave in November       taking over the     kHz frequency       metres  previously held by Radio     later moved to     kHz as a result of international agreements aimed at avoiding interference  all UK MW LW frequencies are divisible by     At this point  Radio   became available across all of the UK for the first time and the station officially became known as Radio   UK  a title that remained until September       For a time during the     s Radio   carried regional news bulletins Monday to Saturday  These were broadcast twice at breakfast  at lunchtime and at     p m  There were also programme variations for the parts of England not served by BBC Local Radio stations  These included Roundabout East Anglia  a VHF opt out of the Today programme broadcast from BBC East s studios in Norwich each weekday from      a m  to      a m      Roundabout East Anglia came to an end in mid      ahead of the launch of BBC Radio Norfolk      All regional news bulletins broadcast from BBC regional news bases around England ended in August       apart from in the south west as until January      there was no BBC Local Radio in the south west so these news bulletins and its weekday morning regional programme  Morning Sou West  continued to be broadcast from the BBC studios in Plymouth on VHF and on the Radio   medium wave Plymouth relay until    December       The launch of Radio   on    August      saw the removal of Open University  schools programming  children s programmes and the Study on   Options adult education slot from Radio   s FM frequencies  Consequently  the full Radio   schedule became available on FM for the first time  However  adult educational and Open University programming returned to Radio   in      when Radio   was closed to make way for the launch of BBC Radio   Live and were broadcast on Sunday evenings on longwave only  Between    January      and   March      FM broadcasts were replaced by a continuous news service devoted to the Gulf War  Radio   News FM  with the main Radio   service being exclusively on longwave  In September      it was decided that the main Radio   service would be on FM as FM coverage had now extended to cover almost all of the UK   Radio   didn t become available on FM in much of Scotland and Wales until the early     s  Opt outs were transferred to longwave  currently Test Match Special  extra shipping forecasts  The Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament  Longwave very occasionally opts out at other times  such as to broadcast special services  the most recent being when Pope Benedict XVI visited Britain in        Programmes and schedules edit  Daily schedule edit  An online schedule page lists the running order of programmes       Production edit  Many programmes are pre recorded  Programmes transmitted live include Today  magazine programme Woman s Hour  consumer affairs programme You and Yours  and  often  the music  film  books  arts and culture programme Front Row  Continuity is managed from Broadcasting House with news bulletins  including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the Six O Clock News and Midnight News  and news programmes such as Today  The World at One and PM  which by early      had returned to Broadcasting House after    years at BBC Television Centre in White City      The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity  which regularly occurs at       each night and       on a Sunday  This has reduced the total number of continuity announcers required each day down from four to three  The Time Signal  known as  the pips   is broadcast every hour to herald the news bulletin  except at midnight and        where the chimes of Big Ben are played  There is no Greenwich Time Signal during the Saturday Afternoon Drama at       on Radio   on Saturdays either  Only pips broadcast on FM MW LW are accurate  On all digital platforms they are in delay by between   and   seconds and even longer online  up to    seconds    Programmes edit  Main article  List of BBC Radio   programmes Radio   programmes cover a wide variety of genre including news and current affairs  history  culture  science  religion  arts  drama and light entertainment  A number of the programmes on Radio   take the form of a  magazine  show  featuring numerous small contributions over the course of the programme Woman s Hour  From Our Own Correspondent  You and Yours  The rise of these magazine shows is primarily due to the work of Tony Whitby  controller of Radio   from      to           The station hosts a number of long running programmes  many of which have been broadcast for over    years  Most programmes are available for four weeks after broadcast as streaming audio from Radio   s listen again page     and via BBC iPlayer  A selection of programmes is also available as podcasts or downloadable audio files      Many comedy and drama programmes from the Radio   archives are rebroadcast on BBC Radio   Extra  formerly BBC Radio     Due to the capacity limitations of DAB and increasing sport broadcasts on BBC Radio   Live Sports Extra  BBC Radio   DAB has to reduce its bit rate most evenings  such that after  p m  its DAB output is usually in mono  even though many of its programmes are made in stereo  including its

by centre right newspapers in recent years have a perceived left political bias across a range of issues              as well as sycophancy in interviews  particularly on the popular morning news magazine Today     as part of a reported perception of a general  malaise  at the BBC  Conversely  the journalist Mehdi Hasan has criticised the station for an overtly  socially and culturally conservative  approach      There has been criticism of Today in particular for a lack of female broadcasters      In September       Radio   employed the first female continuity announcers Hylda Bamber and Barbara Edwards  an event which caused the Daily Mail to proclaim that Radio   had  fallen  to women s liberation   For quite some time  the introduction of female newsreaders led to complaints from listeners  women discussing topics of feminist interest led to similar complaints      In addition  there has been long running criticism by atheist and humanist groups of Thought for the Day  a slot dedicated exclusively to religious discussion during Radio   s flagship morning news programme              Radio   has been criticised for being too middle class and being of little interest to non white listeners           See also edit  ABC Radio National CBC Radio One   A Canadian talk radio station from CBC List of BBC newsreaders and reporters National Public Radio Radio New
