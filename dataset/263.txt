simply Krung Thep  c  The city occupies         square kilometres        sq mi  in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has an estimated population of        million as of            percent of the country s population  Over fourteen million people       percent  lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the      census  making Bangkok an extreme primate city  dwarfing Thailand s other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy  Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the   th century  which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities  Thonburi in      and Rattanakosin in       Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam  later renamed Thailand  during the late   th century  as the country faced pressures from the West  The city was at the centre of Thailand s political struggles throughout the   th century  as the country abolished absolute monarchy  adopted constitutional rule  and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings  The city  incorporated as a special administrative area under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration in       grew rapidly during the     s through the     s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand s politics  economy  education  media and modern society  The Asian investment boom in the     s and     s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok  The city is now a regional force in finance and business  It is an international hub for transport and health care  and has emerged as a centre for the arts  fashion  and entertainment  The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks  as well as its red light districts  The Grand Palace and Buddhist temples including Wat Arun and Wat Pho stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of Khaosan Road and Patpong  Bangkok is among the world s top tourist destinations  and has been named the world s most visited city consistently in several international rankings  Bangkok s rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure  Despite an extensive expressway network  an inadequate road network and substantial private car usage have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion  which caused severe air pollution in the     s  The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem  operating five rapid transit lines and building other public transit  but congestion still remains a prevalent issue  The city faces long term environmental threats such as land subsidence  which contributes to frequent flooding  an issue expected to be exacerbated by the effects of climate

early   th century  when it was a village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River  under the rule of Ayutthaya     Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river  the town gradually increased in importance  Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river  and was the site of a siege in      in which the French were expelled from Siam  After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese Empire in       the newly crowned King Taksin established his capital at the town  which became the base of the Thonburi Kingdom  In       King Phutthayotfa Chulalok  Rama I  succeeded Taksin  moved the capital to the eastern bank s Rattanakosin Island  thus founding the Rattanakosin Kingdom  The City Pillar was erected on    April       which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city      Bangkok s economy gradually expanded through international trade  first with China  then with Western merchants returning in the early to mid   th century  As the capital  Bangkok was the centre of Siam s modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late   th century  The reigns of Kings Mongkut  Rama IV           and Chulalongkorn  Rama V             saw the introduction of the steam engine  printing press  rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city  as well as formal education and healthcare  Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country abolished absolute monarchy in             Engraving of the city from British diplomat John Crawfurd s embassy in      As Thailand allied with Japan in World War II  Bangkok was subjected to Allied bombing  but rapidly grew in the post war period as a result of US aid and government sponsored investment  Bangkok s role as a US military R R destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination  Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok  its population surged from     million to   million in the     s      Following the US withdrawal from Vietnam in       Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment  and the expansion of export oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok      Rapid growth of the city continued through the     s and early     s  until it was stalled by the      Asian financial crisis  By then  many public and social issues had emerged  among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city s notorious traffic jams  Bangkok s role as the nation s political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests  from the student uprisings in      and       anti military demonstrations in       and frequent street protests since       including those by groups opposing and supporting former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra from      to       and a renewed student led movement in           Administration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in       with the establishment of Monthon Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon                        as a national subdivision  In       the monthon was split into several provinces  the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed  The city in its current form was created in      with the formation of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration  BMA   following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year       Name edit  The origin of the name Bangkok          pronounced in Thai as  b    k   k   listen    is unclear  Bang is a Thai word meaning  a village on a stream       and the name might have been derived from Bang Ko            ko meaning  island   stemming from the city s watery landscape     Another theory suggests that it is shortened from Bang Makok             makok being the name of Elaeocarpus hygrophilus  a plant bearing olive like fruit  d  This is supported by the former name of Wat Arun  a historic temple in the area  that used to be called Wat Makok      Officially  the town was known as Thonburi Si Mahasamut                     from Pali and Sanskrit  literally  city of treasures gracing the ocean   or Thonburi  according to the Ayutthaya Chronicles      Bangkok was likely a colloquial name  albeit one widely adopted by foreign visitors  who continued to use it to refer to the city even after the new capital s establishment  When King Rama I established his new capital on the river s eastern bank  the city inherited Ayutthaya s ceremonial name  of which there were many variants  including Krung Thep Thawarawadi Si Ayutthaya                           and Krung Thep Maha Nakhon Si Ayutthaya                               Edmund Roberts  visiting the city as envoy of the United States in       noted that the city  since becoming capital  was known as Sia Yut hia  and this is the name used in international treaties of the period      Today  the city is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon                 or simply Krung Thep             a shortening of the ceremonial name which came into use during the reign of King Mongkut  The full name reads as follows  e           Full ceremonial name   Problems playing this file  See media help  Krungthepmahanakhon

name  although few can explain its meaning as many of the words are archaic  and known to few  Many Thais who recall the full name do so because of its use in the      song  Krung Thep Maha Nakhon  by Thai rock band Asanee Wasan  the lyrics of which consist entirely of the city s full name  repeated throughout the song      The city is now officially known in Thai by a shortened form of the full ceremonial name  Krung Thep Maha Nakhon  which is colloquially further shortened to Krung Thep   Krung is a Thai word of Khmer origin  meaning  capital       while thep is from Pali Sanskrit  meaning  deity  or  god  and corresponding to deva   Bangkok is the city s official English name  as reflected in the name of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration   Government edit  Main article  Bangkok Metropolitan Administration  The city s ceremonial name  partially visible  is displayed in front of Bangkok City Hall  On the building is the BMA seal bearing an image of Indra riding Erawan  The city of Bangkok is locally governed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration  BMA   Although its boundaries are at the provincial  changwat  level  unlike the other    provinces Bangkok is a special administrative area whose governor is directly elected to serve a four year term  The governor  together with four appointed deputies  form the executive body  who implement policies through the BMA civil service headed by the Permanent Secretary for the BMA  In separate elections  each district elects one or more city councillors  who form the Bangkok Metropolitan Council  The council is the BMA s legislative body  and has power over municipal ordinances and the city s budget      However  after the coup of      all local elections have been cancelled and the council was appointed by the government on    September       The current Bangkok Governor is Police General Aswin Kwanmuang  who was appointed by the military government on    October          following the suspension of the last elected governor M R  Sukhumbhand Paribatra  Bangkok is divided into fifty districts  khet  equivalent to amphoe in the other provinces   which are further subdivided into     sub districts  khwaeng  equivalent to tambon   Each district is managed by a district director appointed by the governor  District councils  elected to four year terms  serve as advisory bodies to their respective district directors  The BMA is divided into sixteen departments  each overseeing different aspects of the administration s responsibilities  Most of these responsibilities concern the city s infrastructure  and include city planning  building control  transportation  drainage  waste management and city beautification  as well as education  medical and rescue services      Many of these services are provided jointly with other agencies  The BMA has the authority to implement local ordinances  although civil law enforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police Bureau   The seal of the city shows Hindu god Indra riding in the clouds on Airavata  a divine white elephant known in Thai as Erawan  In his hand Indra holds his weapon  the vajra      The seal is based on a painting done by Prince Naris  The tree symbol of Bangkok is Ficus benjamina      The official city slogan  adopted in       reads  As built by deities  the administrative center  dazzling

the national government  The Government House  Parliament House and Supreme  Administrative and Constitutional Courts are all in the city  Bangkok is the site of the Grand Palace and Dusit Palace  respectively the official and de facto residence of the king  Most government ministries also have headquarters and offices in the capital   Calls to move the capital edit  Bangkok is faced with multiple problems including congestion  see    Transport below   and especially subsidence and flooding  see   Geography  which have raised the issue of moving the nation s capital elsewhere  The idea is not new  during World War II Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram planned unsuccessfully to relocate the capital to Phetchabun  In the     s  the Thaksin Shinawatra administration assigned the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council  NESDC  to formulate a plan to move the capital to Nakhon Nayok Province  The      floods revived the idea of moving government functions from Bangkok  In       the military government assigned NESDC to study the possibility of moving government offices from Bangkok to Chachoengsao Province in the east               Geography edit   Bangkok city proper is highlighted in this satellite image of the lower Chao Phraya delta  The built up urban area extends northward and southward into Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan Provinces  Bangkok city proper covers an area of         square kilometres        sq mi   ranking   th among the other    provinces of Thailand  Of this  about     square kilometres      sq mi  form the built up urban area     It is ranked   rd in the world in terms of land area      The city s urban sprawl reaches into parts of the six other provinces it borders  namely  in clockwise order from northwest  Nonthaburi  Pathum Thani  Chachoengsao  Samut Prakan  Samut Sakhon  and Nakhon Pathom  With the exception of Chachoengsao  these provinces  together with Bangkok  form the greater Bangkok Metropolitan Region      Topography edit  Bangkok is in the Chao Phraya River delta in Thailand s central plain  The river meanders through the city in a southerly direction  emptying into the Gulf of Thailand approximately    kilometres     mi  south of city centre  The area is flat and low lying  with an average elevation of     metres    ft    in  above sea level     g  Most of the area was originally swampland  which was gradually drained and irrigated for agriculture by the construction of canals  khlong  which took place from the   th to   th centuries  The course of the river as it flows through Bangkok has been modified by the construction of several shortcut canals    Bangkok s major canals are shown in this map detailing the original course of the river and its shortcut canals  The city s waterway network served as the primary means of transport until the late   th century  when modern roads began to be built  Up until then  most people lived near or on the water  leading the city to be known during the   th century as the  Venice of the East       Many of these canals have since been filled in or paved over  but others still criss cross the city  serving as major drainage channels and transport routes  Most canals are now badly polluted  although the BMA has committed to the treatment and cleaning up of several canals      The geology of the Bangkok area is characterized by a top layer of soft marine clay  known as  Bangkok clay   averaging    metres     ft  in thickness  which overlies an aquifer system consisting of eight known units  This feature has contributed to the effects of subsidence caused by extensive ground water pumping  First recognized in the     s  subsidence soon became a critical issue  reaching a rate of     millimetres      in  per year in       Ground water management and mitigation measures have since lessened the severity of the situation  although subsidence is still occurring at a rate of    to    millimetres       to      in  per year  and parts of the city are now   metre    ft   in  below sea level      There are fears that the city may be submerged by                   A study published in October      in Nature Communications corrected earlier models of coastal elevations     and concluded that up to    million Thais mostly in the greater Bangkok metropolitan area face the prospect of annual flooding events            Bangkok population density and low elevation coastal zones  Bangkok is especially vulnerable to sea level rise  Subsidence has resulted in increased flood risk  as Bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low elevation and an inadequate drainage infrastructure          often compounded by blockage from rubbish pollution  especially plastic waste       The city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and building drain tunnels  but parts of Bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly inundated  Heavy downpours resulting in urban runoff overwhelming drainage systems  and runoff discharge from upstream areas  are major triggering factors      Severe flooding affecting much of the city occurred in      and       In       most of Bangkok s northern  eastern and western districts were flooded  in some places for over two months  Coastal erosion is also an issue in the gulf coastal area  a small length of which lies within Bangkok s Bang Khun Thian District  Global warming poses further serious risks  and a study by the OECD has estimated that       million people in Bangkok may be exposed to coastal flooding by       the seventh highest figure among the world s port cities        There are no mountains in Bangkok  The closest mountain range is the Khao Khiao Massif  about    km     mi  southeast of the city  Phu Khao Thong  the only hill in the metropolitan area  originated with a very large chedi that King Rama III             built at Wat Saket  The chedi collapsed during construction because the soft soil could not support its weight  Over the next few decades  the abandoned mud and brick structure acquired the shape of a natural hill and became overgrown with weeds  The locals called it phu khao          as if it were a natural feature      In the     s  enclosing concrete walls were added to stop the hill from eroding        Climate edit  Like most of Thailand  Bangkok has a tropical savanna climate  Aw  under the K ppen climate classification and is under the influence of the South Asian monsoon system  It experiences three seasons  hot  rainy  and cool  although temperatures are fairly hot year round  ranging from an average low of       C        F  in December to an average high of       C        F  in April  The rainy season begins with the arrival of the southwest monsoon around mid May  September is the wettest month  with an average rainfall of       millimetres        in   The rainy season lasts until October  when the dry and cool northeast monsoon takes over until February  The hot season is generally dry  but also sees occasional summer storms      The surface magnitude of Bangkok s urban heat island has been measured at      C       F  during the day and      C      F  at night      The highest recorded temperature of Bangkok metropolis was       C         F  in March           and the lowest recorded temperature was      C        F  in January           The Climate Impact Group at NASA s Goddard Institute for Space Studies projected severe weather impacts on Bangkok caused by Climate change  It found that Bangkok in      had     days at or above

the functional divisions of its neighbourhoods or land usage  Although urban planning policies date back to the commission of the  Litchfield Plan  in       which set out strategies for land use  transportation and general infrastructure improvements  zoning regulations were not fully implemented until       As a result  the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion  both horizontally as ribbon developments extended along newly built roads  and vertically  with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas      The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces  The highly populated and growing cities of Nonthaburi  Pak Kret  Rangsit and Samut Prakan are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok  Nevertheless  large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes  Land use in the city consists of    percent residential use     percent agriculture  and    percent used for commerce  industry  and government     The BMA s City Planning

 In Europe  London has      m  of green space per head      Bangkokians thus have    times less green space than is standard in the region s urban areas      Green belt areas include about     square

The BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department  However  many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems  and much of transport related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government   Roads edit  Road based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok  Due to the city s organic development  its streets do not follow an organized grid structure  Forty eight major roads link the different areas of the city  branching into smaller streets and lanes  soi  which serve local neighbourhoods  Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city  while several expressway and motorway routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces    Traffic jams  seen here on Sukhumwit Road  are common in Bangkok  Bangkok s rapid growth in the     s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand  which have since continued in      there were           in use vehicles in Bangkok  of which      percent were private cars and      percent were motorcycles       These increases  in the face of limited carrying capacity  caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early     s  The extent of the problem is such that the Thai Traffic Police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time       While Bangkok s limited road surface area    percent  compared to       percent in most Western cities  is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams  other factors  including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level  inadequate public transport systems  and lack of transportation demand management  also play a role       Efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways  as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems  The city s overall traffic conditions  however  remain poor  Traffic has been the main source of air pollution in Bangkok  which reached serious levels in the     s  But efforts to improve air quality by improving fuel quality and enforcing emission standards  among others  had visibly ameliorated the problem by the     s  Atmospheric particulate matter levels dropped from    micrograms per cubic metre in      to    in            However  increasing vehicle numbers and a lack of

cycling is still largely impractical  especially in the city centre  Most of these bicycle lanes share the pavement with pedestrians  Poor surface maintenance  encroachment by hawkers and street vendors  and a hostile environment for cyclists and pedestrians  make cycling and walking unpopular methods of getting around in Bangkok   Buses and taxis edit   Many buses  minibuses and taxis share

registered for use as taxis       Meters have been required for car taxis since       while tuk tuk fares are usually negotiated  Motorcycle taxis operate from regulated ranks  with either fixed or negotiable fares  and are usually employed for relatively short journeys  Despite their popularity  taxis have gained a bad reputation for often refusing passengers when the requested route is not to the driver s convenience       Motorcycle taxis were previously unregulated  and subject to extortion by organized crime gangs  Since       registration has been required for motorcycle taxi ranks

it was only in      that the BTS finally began operation  The BTS consists of two lines  Sukhumvit and Silom  with    stations along       kilometres        mi        The MRT opened for use in July       and currently consists of two lines  the Blue Line and Purple Line  The Airport Rail Link  opened in August       connects the city center to Suvarnabhumi Airport to the east  Its eight stations span a distance of    kilometres     mi   Although initial passenger numbers were low and their service area was limited to the inner city until the      opening of the Purple Line  which serves the Nonthaburi area  these systems have become indispensable to many commuters  The BTS reported an average of         daily trips in            while the MRT had         passenger trips per day       As of September      update   construction work is ongoing to extend the city wide transit system s reach  including the construction of the Light Red grade separated commuter rail line  The entire Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region consists of eight main lines and four feeder lines totaling     kilometres      mi  to be completed by       In addition to rapid transit and heavy rail lines  there have been proposals for several monorail systems   Water transport edit   The Chao Phraya Express Boat serves over        passengers daily  Although much diminished from its past prominence  water based transport still plays an important role in Bangkok and the immediate upstream and downstream provinces  Several water buses serve commuters daily  The Chao Phraya Express Boat serves thirty four stops along the river  carrying an average of        passengers per day in       while the smaller Khlong Saen Saep boat service serves twenty seven stops on Saen Saep Canal with        daily passengers  Long tail boats operate on fifteen regular routes on the Chao Phraya  and passenger ferries at thirty two river crossings served an average of         daily passengers in            Bangkok Port  popularly known by its location as Khlong Toei Port  was Thailand s main international port from its opening in      until it was superseded by the deep sea Laem Chabang Port in       It is primarily a cargo port  though its inland location limits access to ships of        deadweight tonnes or less  The port handled            tonnes             tons  of cargo in the first eight months of the      fiscal year  about    percent the total of the country s international ports             Airports edit   Suvarnabhumi Airport is home to flag carrier Thai Airways International  Bangkok is one of Asia s busiest air transport hubs  Two commercial airports serve the city  the older Don Mueang International Airport and the newer Suvarnabhumi Airport  Suvarnabhumi  which replaced Don Mueang as Bangkok s main airport after its opening in       served            passengers in            making it the world s   th busiest airport by passenger volume  This volume exceeded its designed capacity of    million passengers  Don Mueang reopened for domestic flights in            and resumed international service focusing on low cost carriers in October            Suvarnabhumi is undergoing expansion to increase its capacity to    million passengers by      and    million by             Health and education edit  Education edit   The campus of Chulalongkorn University was surrounded by rural fields when it was established in       Pathum Wan District has since become part of the Bangkok city centre  Bangkok has long been the centre of modern education in Thailand  The first schools in the country were established here in the later   th century  and there are now       schools in the city       The city is home to the country s five oldest universities  Chulalongkorn  Thammasat  Kasetsart  Mahidol and Silpakorn  founded between      and       The city has since continued its dominance  especially in higher education  the majority of the country s universities  both public and private  are located in Bangkok or the Metropolitan Region  Chulalongkorn and Mahidol are the only Thai universities to appear in the top     of the QS World University Rankings       King Mongkut s University of Technology Thonburi  also located in Bangkok  is the only Thai university in the top     of the         Times Higher Education World University Rankings       Over the past few decades the general trend of pursuing a university degree has prompted the founding of new universities to meet the needs of Thai students  Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities  but also for a chance to receive a university degree  Ramkhamhaeng University emerged in      as Thailand s first open university  it now has the highest enrolment in the country  The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges  both public and private  While many universities have been established in major provinces  the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions  and the city s tertiary education scene remains over populated with non Bangkokians  The situation is not limited to higher education  either  In the     s     to    percent of     to    year olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education  This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital       Although this discrepancy has since largely abated  tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok s leading schools  Education has long been a prime factor in the centralization of Bangkok and will play a vital role in the government s efforts to decentralize the country   Healthcare edit   Siriraj Hospital  established in       is the oldest hospital in Thailand  Much of Thailand s medical resources are disproportionately concentrated in the capital  In       Bangkok had      percent of the country s doctors and a physician to population ratio of        compared to a median of         among all provinces       The city is home to    public hospitals  five of which are university hospitals  as well as    private hospitals and       registered clinics  dead link       The BMA operates nine public hospitals through its Medical Service Department  and its Health Department provides primary care through sixty eight community health centres  Thailand s universal healthcare system is implemented through public hospitals and health centres as well as participating private providers  Research oriented medical school affiliates such as Siriraj  King Chulalongkorn Memorial and Ramathibodi Hospitals are among the largest in the country  and act as tertiary care centres  receiving referrals from distant parts of the country  Lately  especially in the private sector  there has been much growth in medical tourism  with hospitals such as Bumrungrad and Bangkok Hospital  among others  providing services specifically catering to foreigners  An estimated         medical tourists visited Thailand in       making Bangkok the most popular global destination for medical tourism        Crime and safety edit   Political violence has at times spilled onto the streets of Bangkok  as seen during the military crackdown on protesters in       Bangkok has a relatively moderate crime rate when compared to urban counterparts around the world       Traffic accidents are a major hazard      while natural disasters are rare  Intermittent episodes of political unrest and occasional terrorist attacks have resulted in losses of life  Although the crime threat in Bangkok is relatively low  non confrontational crimes of opportunity such as pick pocketing  purse snatching  and credit card fraud occur with frequency       Bangkok s growth since the     s has been followed by increasing crime rates partly driven by urbanisation  migration  unemployment and poverty  By the late     s  Bangkok s crime rates were about four times that of the rest of the country  The police have long been preoccupied with street crimes ranging from housebreaking to assault and murder       The     s saw the emergence of vehicle theft and organized crime  particularly by foreign gangs       Drug trafficking  especially that of ya ba methamphetamine pills  is also chronic            According to police statistics  the most common complaint received by the Metropolitan Police Bureau in      was housebreaking  with        cases  This was followed by       cases of motorcycle thefts        cases of assault and       cases of embezzlement  Serious offences included     murders     gang robberies      robberies    kidnapping and   arson cases  Offences against the state were by far more common  and included        drug related cases         cases involving prostitution and       related to gambling       The Thailand Crime Victim Survey conducted by the Office of Justice Affairs of the Ministry of Justice found that     percent of surveyed households reported a member being victim of a crime in       Of these       percent were crimes against property      percent were crimes against life and body  and     percent were information related crimes       Political demonstrations and protests are common in Bangkok  The historic uprisings of            and      are infamously known for the deaths from military suppression  Most events since then have been peaceful  but the series of major protests since      have often turned violent  Demonstrations during March May      ended in a crackdown in which    were killed  including armed and unarmed protesters  security forces  civilians and journalists  Terrorist incidents have also occurred in Bangkok  most notably the bombing in      at the Erawan shrine  which killed     and also a series of bombings on the         New Year s Eve  Traffic accidents are a major hazard in Bangkok  There were        accidents in the city in       resulting in        injuries and     deaths as well as        million baht in damages  However  the rate of fatal accidents is much lower than in the rest of Thailand  While accidents in Bangkok amounted to      percent of the entire country  only     percent of fatalities occurred in the city       Another serious public health hazard comes from Bangkok s stray dogs  Up to         strays are estimated to roam the city s streets       and dog bites are among the most common injuries treated in the emergency departments of the city s hospitals  Rabies is prevalent among the dog population  and treatment for bites pose a heavy public burden  k   International relations edit   Protesters in front of the United Nations Building during the      Bangkok Climate Change Conference  Bangkok is home to several UN offices  The city s formal international relations are managed by the International Affairs Division of the BMA  Its missions include partnering with other major cities through sister city agreements  participation and membership in international organizations  and pursuing cooperative activities with the
