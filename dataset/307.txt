 Edition of Contemporary Music  is an independent record label founded by Karl Egger  Manfred Eicher and Manfred Scheffner in Munich in       While ECM is best known for jazz music  the label has released a variety of recordings  and ECM s artists often refuse to acknowledge boundaries between genres  ECM s motto is  the Most Beautiful Sound Next to Silence   taken from a      review of ECM releases in Coda  a Canadian jazz magazine     ECM has been distributed in the U S  by Warner Bros  Records  PolyGram Records  BMG  and  since       Universal Music  the successor of PolyGram  worldwide  Its album covers were profiled in two books  Sleeves of Desire and Windfall Light  both published by Lars M ller   Contents    History   ECM and film   Discography   Record label of the year awards   Further reading   References   External links   History edit  The first ECM release produced by Manfred Scheffner was pianist Mal Waldron s      recording  Free at Last  The label went on to release recordings by many prominent jazz musicians  including Keith Jarrett  Jan Garbarek  Pat Metheny  Gary Burton  Chick Corea  Charlie Haden  John Abercrombie  Dave Liebman  Eberhard Weber  Egberto Gismonti  Dave Holland   Terje Rypdal  and Ralph Towner  The label has also released recordings in the world music genre by artists including Steve Tibbetts  Stephan Micus  Codona  Anouar Brahem  L  Shankar  Jon Hassell  and Nan  Vasconcelos  The ECM New Series was created in      to document Western classical works  It has released works by composers from the early  Thomas Tallis  Carlo Gesualdo  Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina  to the contemporary  John Cage  Elliott Carter  Steve Reich and John Adams   The series was initiated for Arvo P rt s record debut Tabula Rasa  which Eicher recorded and produced in             and       Since then P rt and Eicher have built a strong relationship  all works premiere on recordings for the label and all are done in presence of the composer  Keith Jarrett  better known as a jazz musician  contributed together with Gidon Kremer amongst others to Tabula Rasa  He later recorded several classical works by Bach  Mozart  Shostakovich  and others for the series  The three albums Music for    Musicians  Octet Music for a Large Ensemble Violin Phase  and Tehillim by Reich were recorded before       all with the composer performing  and were later moved to the classical department together with some by Meredith Monk  Thomas Demenga and Harald Weiss     Several of John Adams  works from his minimalist period have been released through the label as well  including Harmonium and Harmonielehre  Over the years  many other works by contemporary composers such as Valentyn Sylvestrov  Tigran Mansurian  Erkki Sven T  r  Heinz Holliger  Giya Kancheli  Gy rgy Kurt g  or Heiner Goebbels as well as the soundtracks of several works by the filmmaker Jean Luc Godard have been issued on the ECM New Series label  Interpreters who released records in classical genres include Kim Kashkashian  Andr s Schiff  Gidon Kremer  the Hilliard Ensemble  Thomas Zehetmair  Carolin Widmann  Till Fellner  Herbert Henck  Alexei Lubimov  Andr s Keller  Mikl s Per nyi  John Holloway  John Potter or most recently Patricia Kopatchinskaja                    On many releases  the jazz and classical sides of ECM are combined  For example  Garbarek s Officium        features him playing saxophone solos over the Hilliard Ensemble singing Gregorian chant  early polyphony and Renaissance works  Garbarek s work with guitarist Ralph Towner draws on  and is as apparently influenced by    th century chamber music as by any overtly jazz oriented material  John Potter  formerly of the Hilliard Ensemble  has recorded works by John Dowland with jazz saxophonist John Surman and others  and Surman s Proverbs and Songs is a suite of choral settings of Old Testament texts  recorded in Salisbury Cathedral  The label has also released unique works that fit into no obvious genre at all  like the records of composer Meredith Monk   In      and      ECM released a series of compilation CDs titled  rarum  Twenty of the label s artists were asked to compile a single CD of their work for the label  Garbarek and Jarrett s compilations are double CDs   Artists who contributed to this series are Keith Jarrett  Jan Garbarek  Chick Corea  Gary Burton  Bill Frisell  Art Ensemble of Chicago  Terje Rypdal  Bobo Stenson  Pat Metheny  Dave Holland  Egberto Gismonti  Jack DeJohnette  John Surman  John Abercrombie  Carla Bley  Paul Motian  Tomasz Sta ko  Eberhard Weber  Arild Andersen  Jon Christensen  Manfred Eicher continues to take an active interest in the music released by ECM  acting as producer on the vast majority of its recordings  although Steve Lake  Thomas Stoewsand  Robert Hurwitz  Lee Townsend  Hans Wendl and Sun Chung have also produced discs for the label  The typical ECM session is just three days  two days to record  one day to mix  Many of the albums have been recorded with Jan Erik Kongshaug  of Talent Studios and later Rainbow Studios  in Oslo  Norway  as sound engineer  other engineers have included Martin Wieland  who recorded Jarrett s  The K ln Concert    James Farber  Stefano Amerio and  on classical recordings  Peter Laenger  After working as a writer for the Melody Maker Steve Lake first joined the ECM staff in          While working predominant for the writing department he now has also produced more than    records which are more in the experimental areas of jazz like ones of Evan Parker  Roscoe Mitchell  Hal Russell  Robin Williamson  Joe Maneri or Mat Maneri      Furthermore  he published the book Horizons Touched  The Music of ECM        with music critic novelist Paul Griffiths and made contributions to the books Sleeves of Desire  a Cover Story         Windfall Light  The Visual Language of ECM        and ECM   A Cultural Archaeology             In fall      the Munich museum Haus der Kunst opened an exhibition about the work of the label called ECM   A Cultural Archaeology  It pointed out the early jazz focused years till mid    s before the New Series was initiated  In close relation with Eicher and ECM the exhibition was created by Okwui Enwezor and Markus M ller  In contrast to the historic based content of the exhibition  it was accompanied with a concert series of current artists of the label which included Fran ois Couturier  Enrico Rava  Meredith Monk  Andr s Schiff  Evan Parker  Gidon Kremer or Tomasz Sta ko       Some of them  anyway  do have a long past with the label   even if their  home  is ECM or New Series          Additionally Eicher curated also a film series of eleven selected movies which relate to the label   some of its filmmakers are strongly related to ECM like Theo Angelopoulos or Jean Luc Godard  others gave inspiration to the label like Ingmar Bergman or Andrei Tarkovsky  and others used its music      The physical catalogue of the exhibition was published by Prestel Verlag in German and English      Another extended exhibition was displayed in Seoul  Korea  from September till November       Under the Gertrude Stein quote Think of your Ears as Eyes the exhibition took a wider view on the label s history than the Munich one  but was also accompanied by a concert series with Kim Kashkashian  Andr s Schiff  Myung whun Chung  Heinz Holliger  Norma Winstone  Ralph Towner and Yeahwon Shin      On November          ECM announced in a press release that its entire catalog would be made available for streaming on all major music streaming platforms  Apple Music  Amazon  Spotify  Deezer  Tidal and Qobuz   The catalog thus became available from November           Previously  ECM recordings had never been available for streaming  save for a few select compilations of major performers  In a press release on its website  ECM explained its decision   In recent years  ECM and the musicians have had to face unauthorized streaming of recordings via video sharing websites  plus piracy  bootlegs  and a proliferation of illegal download sites  It was important to make the catalogue accessible within a framework where copyrights are respected      ECM further added that the physical recordings  CD   LP  still constitute the  preferred mediums        ECM and film edit  The label has a special relation towards film and directors      Founder Manfred Eicher himself is a very passionate movie viewer and directed in      an adaption of Max Frisch s Holoz n together with Heinz B tler          The label has also released some soundtracks e g  for The Return        by Andrey Zvyagintsev or Nouvelle Vague  ECM NewSeries          and Histoire s  du cin ma  ECM NewSeries       by French Swiss director Jean Luc Godard  This collaboration expanded over the years and led on the one hand into the contribution of several stills from Godard s movies for covers like Morimur  ECM NewSeries       by Christoph Poppen  Asturiana   Songs from Spain and Argentinia  ECM NewSeries       by Kim Kashkashian or the      Live at Birdland  ECM       by Lee Konitz Brad Mehldau Charlie Haden Paul Motian      On the other hand  Eicher took over the musical direction of many of Godard s films like Germany Year    Nine Zero  H las pour moi  JLG or For Ever Mozart  Besides these Eicher was also the head behind the music of Xavier Koller s Reise der Hoffnung  Sandra Nettelbeck s Mostly Martha and the Oscar nominated documentary War Photographer by Christian Frei      Additionally Godard has released a collection of short films on the label with Anne Marie Mi ville called Four Short Films  ECM            Apart from her own work Greek composer Eleni Karaindrou wrote scores for stage and for movies  which include Ulysses  Gaze         Eternity and a Day        and The Dust of Time         among others by filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos released on ECM      The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz  who has also worked with Angelopoulos  has recorded two spoken word albums for the label  one in      with poems by Friedrich H lderlin  ECM New Series       and one in      called Wenn Wasser W re  ECM New Series       with works of T  S  Eliot and Giorgos Seferis  Another nameable release is the record Scardanelli  ECM       with texts and music from Harald Bergmann s film of the same name from       which

   ECM released a record called Turmgedichte  ECM New Series       by actor voice actor vocalist Christian Reiner also with poems by H lderlin      Furthermore  ECM has many projects and albums
