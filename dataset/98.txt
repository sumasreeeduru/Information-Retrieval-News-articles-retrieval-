Austronesians reached the Philippines at around      BC  settling the Batanes Islands and northern Luzon from Taiwan  From there  they rapidly spread downwards to the rest of the islands of the Philippines and Southeast Asia          This population assimilated with the existing Negritos resulting in the modern Filipino ethnic groups which display various ratios of genetic admixture between Austronesian and Negrito groups      Jade artifacts have been found dated to      BC          with the lingling o jade items crafted in Luzon made using raw materials originating from Taiwan      By

of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine  the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork  not knife and fork       The traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan  using the hand for bringing food to the mouth       was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas       However  due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities  as well as to Filipino urbanites  kamayan fast became popular            This recent trend also sometimes

regional or seasonal variations in climate that might affect the incidence of some diseases  In general  however  the fact that the Philippines comprise some seven thousand islands  some of which are
