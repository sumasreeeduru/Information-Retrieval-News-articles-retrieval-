Scottish  and Welsh descent            Clinton has two younger brothers  Hugh and Tony        Rodham in sixth grade  Rodham in Maine South High School s      yearbook As a child  Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge      She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout      She has often told the story             of being inspired by U S  efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around      asking what she could do to become an astronaut  only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program      She attended Maine East High School  where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society         She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys  one of whom told her that  you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president       For her senior year  she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School  There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted  most likely to succeed   She graduated in      in the top five percent of her class      Rodham s mother wanted her to have an independent  professional career      Her father  who was otherwise a traditionalist  felt that his daughter s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender      She was raised in a politically conservative household      and she helped canvass Chicago s South Side at age    after the very close      U S  presidential election  She saw evidence of electoral fraud  such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots  against Republican candidate Richard Nixon      and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the      election      Rodham s early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher  like her father  a fervent anti communist   who introduced her to Goldwater s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister  like her mother  concerned with issues of social justice   with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met  civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr  at a      speech in Chicago s Orchestra Hall       Wellesley College

        During her first year  she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans          As the leader of this  Rockefeller Republican  oriented group      she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate      She later stepped down from this position  In      Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years      In a letter to her youth minister at that time  she described herself as  a mind conservative and a heart liberal       In contrast to the factions in the     s that advocated radical actions against the political system  she sought to work for change within it          By her junior year  Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy      In early      she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association  a position she held until early               Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr   Rodham organized a two day student strike and worked with Wellesley s black students to recruit more black students and faculty      In her student government role  she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges          A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States      To help her better understand her changing political views  Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference  and she attended the  Wellesley in Washington  summer program      Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller s late entry campaign for the Republican nomination      Rodham attended the      Republican National Convention in Miami Beach  However  she was upset by the way Richard Nixon s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention s  veiled  racist messages  and she left the Republican Party for good      Rodham wrote her senior thesis  a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky  under Professor Schechter       Years later  while she was the first lady  access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation  The thesis was later released       In       she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts      with departmental honors in political science      After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement  she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event  Her address followed that of the commencement speaker  Senator Edward Brooke          After her speech  she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes              She was featured in an article published in Life magazine          because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke      She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers      She was asked to speak at the   th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington  D C   the next year      That summer  she worked her way across Alaska  washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez  which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions        Yale Law School and postgraduate studies Rodham then entered Yale Law School  where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action      During her second year  she worked at the Yale Child Study Center      learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work  Beyond the Best Interests of the Child                 She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale New Haven Hospital      and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor      In the summer of       she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman s Washington Research Project  where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor  There she researched various migrant workers  issues including education  health and housing      Edelman later became a significant mentor      Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the      campaign of Connecticut U S  Senate candidate Joseph Duffey  Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics      In the spring of       she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton  During the summer  she interned at the Oakland  California  law firm of Treuhaft  Walker and Burnstein  The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights  civil liberties and radical causes  two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members       Rodham worked on child custody and other cases  a  Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California      the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school      The following summer  Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful      Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern      She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in           having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton      He first proposed marriage to her following graduation  but she declined  uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his      Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center      In late      her first scholarly article   Children Under the Law   was published in the Harvard Educational Review      Discussing the new children s rights movement  the article stated that  child citizens  were  powerless individuals      and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age  but instead that courts should presume competence on a case by case basis  except when there is evidence otherwise      The article became frequently cited in the field       Marriage  family  law career and first ladyship of Arkansas From the East Coast to Arkansas During her postgraduate studies  Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman s newly founded Children s Defense Fund in Cambridge  Massachusetts      and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children      In       she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington  D C   and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal      Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W  Nussbaum      Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for it      The committee s work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August           By then  Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future  Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham s career      Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president      Meanwhile  boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him  but she continued to demur      After failing the District of Columbia bar exam     and passing the Arkansas exam  Rodham came to a key decision  As she later wrote   I chose to follow my heart instead of my head       She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas  rather than staying in Washington  where career prospects were brighter  He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U S  House of Representatives in his home state  In August       Rodham moved to Fayetteville  Arkansas  and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas  Fayetteville           Early Arkansas years At the university  Rodham taught classes in criminal law  She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades      Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school  where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding      As a court appointed lawyer  Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a    year old girl  after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed  Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge  She has called the trial a  terrible case       During her time in Fayetteville  Rodham and several other women founded the city s first rape crisis center      Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married  she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost  and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else      In       Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race  facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt      Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of      and she agreed to marry him      The wedding took place on October           in a Methodist ceremony in their living room      A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham          Her motivation was threefold  She wanted to keep the couple s professional lives separate  avoid apparent conflicts of interest  and as she told a friend at the time   it showed that I was still me       The decision upset both mothers  who were more traditional      In       Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter          In November       Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general  and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock      In February       Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm  a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence      She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law     while working pro bono in child advocacy      she rarely performed litigation work in court      Rodham maintained her interest in children s law and family policy  publishing the scholarly articles  Children s Policies  Abandonment and Neglect  in          and  Children s Rights  A Legal Perspective  in           The latter continued her argument that children s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases  judicial intervention was sometimes warranted  An American Bar Association chair later said   Her articles were important  not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate       Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as  one of the more important scholar activists of the last two decades       Conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority      would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents      and exemplified critical legal studies run amok        Hillary and Bill lived in this house in Little Rock s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General                  In       Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families  a state level alliance with the Children s Defense Fund          Later that year  President Jimmy Carter  for whom Rodham had been the      campaign director of field operations in Indiana      appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation      She held that position from      until the end of           From mid      to mid       b  she was the chair of that board  the first woman to hold the job       During her time as chair  funding for the corporation was expanded from     million to      million  subsequently  she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization      Following her husband s November      election as governor of Arkansas  Rodham became that state s first lady in January       She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years                     Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year       where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas s poorest areas without affecting doctors  fees       In       Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm       From      until they entered the White House  she had a higher salary than her husband       During      and       while looking to supplement their income  Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts       an initial        investment generated nearly          when she stopped trading after ten months       At this time  the couple began their ill fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal       Both of these became subjects of controversy in the     s  On February           Rodham gave birth to the couple s only child  a daughter whom they named Chelsea  In November       Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re election        Later Arkansas years  Bill and Hillary Clinton with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan Two years after leaving office  Bill Clinton returned to his job as governor of Arkansas after winning the election of       During her husband s campaign  Hillary began to use the name  Hillary Clinton   or sometimes  Mrs  Bill Clinton   to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters  she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full time       During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas  she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name  c  She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in       where she sought to reform the state s court sanctioned public education system            In one of the Clinton governorship s most important initiatives  she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size            It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort           In       she introduced Arkansas s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth  a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy       She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in      and Arkansas Mother of the Year in                 Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas  She earned less than the other partners  as she billed fewer hours      but still made more than          in her final year there       The firm considered her a  rainmaker  because she brought in clients  partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections  She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges       Bill Clinton s Republican opponent in his      gubernatorial re election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business  the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated       From      to       Clinton was on the board of directors  sometimes as chair  of the New World Foundation       which funded a variety of New Left interest groups       From      to       she was the first chair of the American Bar Association s Commission on Women in the Profession  created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it       She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the     most influential lawyers in America in      and            When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in       Hillary Clinton considered running  Private polls were unfavorable  however  and in the end he ran and was re elected for the final time         Clinton in      Clinton was chairman of the board of the Children s Defense Fund         and on the board of the Arkansas Children s Hospital s Legal Services                In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations  she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY                 Wal Mart Stores                and Lafarge                 TCBY and Wal Mart were Arkansas based companies that were also clients of Rose Law            Clinton was the first female member on Wal Mart s board  added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it       Once there  she pushed successfully for Wal Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices  She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company s management and was silent about the company s famously anti labor union practices                 According to Dan Kaufman  awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor  helping contribute to her loss in the      election  where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump             Bill Clinton presidential campaign of      Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the      Democratic presidential nomination  Before the New Hampshire primary  tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers       In response  the Clintons appeared together on    Minutes  where Bill denied the affair  but acknowledged  causing pain in my marriage        This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign       During the campaign  Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song  Stand by Your Man   d  Later in the campaign  she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas  but wanted to pursue her career instead  e  The remarks were widely criticized  particularly by those who were  or defended  stay at home mothers  In retrospect  she admitted they were ill considered  Bill said that in electing him  the nation would  get two for the price of one   referring to the prominent role his wife would assume       Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg s August      The American Spectator article  The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock   Hillary s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives      At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth        First Lady of the United States             When Bill Clinton took office as president in January       Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady  Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name  c  She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House       She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing           She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration  Her choices filled at least eleven top level positions and dozens more lower level ones       After Eleanor Roosevelt  Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history            Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in public policy matters  Supporters pointed out that Clinton s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors  and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband s presidency       Bill Clinton s campaign promise of  two for the price of one  led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as  co presidents  or sometimes use the Arkansas label  Billary                  The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into  imaginary discussions  with the also politically active Eleanor Roosevelt  f  From the time she came to Washington  Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures            Triggered in part by the death of her father in April       she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings  liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner s  politics of meaning  to overcome what she saw as America s  sleeping sickness of the soul   that would lead to a willingness  to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century  moving into a new millennium              Health care and other policy initiatives See also  Clinton health care plan of       Clinton presenting her health care plan  September      In January       President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform  hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform       Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority            The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan  This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations  Its opponents quickly derided the plan as  Hillarycare  and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress       Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July      bus tour to rally support for the plan  Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times       Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate  although Democrats controlled both chambers   the proposal was abandoned in September            Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors  The first lady s approval ratings  which had generally been in the high    percent range during her first year  fell to    percent in April      and    percent

Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare  however  Hillary urged him to veto the bills  which he did            A third version came up during his      general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas  critics  including her past mentor Edelman  urged her to get the president to veto it again       But she decided to support the bill  which became the Welfare Reform Act of       as the best political compromise available            This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called  sad and painful        Together with Attorney General Janet Reno  Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice      In       she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe

World Conference on Women in Beijing  Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People s Republic of China itself  She declared   it is no longer acceptable to discuss women s rights as separate from human rights        Delegates from over     countries heard her say   If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference  let it be that human rights are women s rights and women s rights are human rights  once and for all        In doing so  she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks            The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton s key phrases       During the late     s  she was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban            She helped create Vital Voices  an international initiative sponsored by the U S  to

controversy Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel  committees of the U S  Congress and the press  The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from its publication in a New York Times report during the      presidential campaign      and throughout her time as the first lady  The Clintons had lost their late     s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation  at the same time  their partners in that investment  Jim and Susan McDougal  operated Madison Guaranty  a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm      and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses  Madison Guaranty later failed  and Clinton s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators her husband had appointed       She said she had done minimal work for the bank       Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton s legal billing records  she said she did not know where they were            After a two year search  the records were found in the first lady s White House book room and delivered to investigators in early            The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been       Clinton s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor s Mansion       On January           Clinton became the first spouse of a U S  president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury       After several Independent Counsels had investigated  a final report was issued in      that stated there was

of the May      firings of the White House Travel Office employees  an action that became known as  Travelgate   began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas       The      discovery of a two year old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true            The      final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made  factually false  statements  but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings  to prosecute her       In March       newspaper reports revealed that Clinton had earned spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in               The press made allegations that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery  Several individuals analyzed her trading records  but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing       An outgrowth of the  Travelgate  investigation was the June      discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees  an affair that some called  Filegate        Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office       The      final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter       In early       a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House  there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons  personal property  During the last year of Bill

that year  including three weeks at number one       By       it had sold         copies in hardcover and another         in paperback       Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in      for the book s audio recording        Response to Lewinsky scandal Further information  Clinton Lewinsky scandal In       the Clintons  private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with    year old White House intern Monica Lewinsky       Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives  he was later acquitted by the senate  When the allegations against her husband were first made public  Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a  vast right wing conspiracy             She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long  organized  collaborative series of charges by Bill s political enemies g  rather than any wrongdoing by her husband  She later said she had been misled by her husband s initial claims that no affair had taken place       After the evidence of President Clinton s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible  she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage  Privately  she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage       The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period       Public reaction varied  Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public  They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband s insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband s indiscretions  They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence       In the wake of the revelations  her public approval ratings shot upward to around    percent  the highest they had ever been       In her      memoir  she would attribute her decision to stay married to  a love that has persisted for decades  and add   No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does  Even after all these years  he is still the most interesting  energizing and fully alive person I have ever met        Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills  In       Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House  not only dead broke  but in debt   The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office  The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks        Other books and initiatives Other books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks  Dear Buddy  Kids  Letters to the First Pets

efforts around the building  often trying to make it look brighter       These included changing of the Treaty Room and a presidential study to have a   th century look       Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices  with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most       Clinton hosted many large scale events at the White House  including a state dinner for

related to his failing marriage became public  Clinton then faced Rick Lazio  a Republican member of the U S  House of Representatives who represented New York s  nd congressional district  Throughout

credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment  especially in the high tech sector  She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long term care       The contest drew

at least early            On January           she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of       stating   I m in and I m in to win        No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency  and no first lady had ever run for president  When Bill Clinton became president in       a blind trust was established  in April       the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race  Later disclosure statements revealed the couple s worth was now upwards of     million       They had earned over      million since      most of it coming from Bill s books  speaking engagements and other activities         Clinton at the      CDA National Convention Throughout the first half of       Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election  Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors       The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War  which Obama had opposed from the beginning       Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising  swapping the money lead each quarter       At the end of October  Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama  Edwards  and her other opponents            Obama s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton s message of experience         Clinton campaigning at Augsburg College in Minneapolis  Minnesota  two days before Super Tuesday       In the first vote of       she placed third in the January   Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards       Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days  with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary       Clinton gained a surprise win there on January    narrowly defeating Obama       It was the first time a woman had won a major American party s presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection       Explanations for Clinton s New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically  especially by women  after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter s question the day before the election       The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days  Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates       and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr  and Lyndon B  Johnson  i  were perceived by many as  accidentally or intentionally  limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign       Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue  Democratic voting became more polarized as a result  with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans            She lost by a two to one margin to Obama in the January     South Carolina primary       setting up  with Edwards soon dropping out  an intense two person contest for the twenty two February   Super Tuesday states  Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign  and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president  needs to stop        The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton  eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy         State by state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses  shaded by percentage won  Obama in purple  Clinton in green   Popular vote winners and delegate winners differed in New Hampshire  Nevada  Missouri  Texas and Guam   On Super Tuesday  Clinton won the largest states  such as California  New York  New Jersey and Massachusetts  while Obama won more states       they almost evenly split the total popular vote       But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules       The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort  lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign            There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff  and she made several top level personnel changes            Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country  often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton            On March    Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places       where her criticism of NAFTA  a major legacy of her husband s presidency  helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular       Throughout the campaign  Obama dominated caucuses  for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare            Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger  college educated  or more affluent voters were heavily represented  Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older  non college educated  or working class white voters predominated            Behind in delegates  Clinton s best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted  party appointed superdelegates         Clinton speaks on behalf of her former rival  Barack Obama  during the second night of the      Democratic National Convention Following the final primaries on June          Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee       In a speech before her supporters on June    Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama       By campaign s end  Clinton had won       pledged delegates to Obama s             at the time of the clinching  Clinton had     superdelegates to Obama s           with those numbers widening to     versus     once Obama was acknowledged the winner       Clinton and Obama each received over    million votes during the nomination process j  with both breaking the previous record       Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed  by a very wide margin  Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm s      marks for most votes garnered and

victory over McCain in the general election on November         Clinton s campaign ended up severely in debt  she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the     million that she lent it herself  The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of              Official secretary of state portrait       Secretary of State             Main article  Hillary Clinton s tenure as

state to Hillary Rodham Clinton as her husband Bill Clinton holds the Bible In mid November       President elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration       She was initially quite reluctant  but on November    she told Obama she would accept the position            On December    President elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state            Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate  but that the new position represented a  difficult and exciting adventure        As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest  Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J  Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative       The appointment required a Saxbe fix  passed and signed into law in December            Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January           a week before the Obama inauguration  two days later  the committee voted      to approve Clinton       By this time  her public approval rating had reached    percent  the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal       On January           Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of            Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state  resigning from the Senate later that day       She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet        First half of tenure  Clinton and Obama at the   st NATO summit  April      Clinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U S  foreign policy would change direction   We have a lot of damage to repair        She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department  and cited the need for an increased U S  diplomatic presence  especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions       Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms  the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review  which establishes specific objectives for the State Department s diplomatic missions abroad  it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee       The first such review was issued in late       It called for the U S  leading through  civilian power  as a cost effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises       It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world       A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world  to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women         Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Clinton hold a  reset button   March      In a      internal debate regarding the War in Afghanistan  Clinton sided with the military s recommendations for a maximal  Afghanistan surge   recommending        troops and no public deadline for withdrawal  She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden s opposition but eventually supported Obama s compromise plan to send an additional        troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal            In March       Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a  reset button  symbolizing U S  attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president  Dmitry Medvedev            The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian  The policy  which became known as the Russian reset  led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev s time in office       Relations would worsen considerably  however  following Vladimir Putin s return to the position in            In October       on a trip to Switzerland  Clinton s intervention overcame last minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long hostile nations            In Pakistan  she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students  talk show hosts and tribal elders  in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U S       k  Beginning in       she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran  in an effort to force curtailment of that country s nuclear program  this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in                      Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles  she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president            Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks       Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non ideological  pragmatic exercise       She met with him weekly but did not have the close  daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents       moreover  certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon            Nevertheless  the president had trust in her actions         Greeting service members at Andersen Air Force Base  Guam  October      In a prepared speech in January       Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet       Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it  The speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy       In July       she visited South Korea  where she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE A  a large apparel subcontractor  to invest in Haiti despite the company s deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage  In the summer of       the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department  ensuring that the Caracol Industrial Park would have a key tenant       This was part of the  build back better  program initiated by her husband  named UN Special Envoy to Haiti in      after a tropical storm season caused    billion in damages to the island       In January       Clinton traveled to Haiti in order to help pave the way for the election of Michel Martelly        Second half of tenure The      Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration       Clinton s public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was  stable   to a stance that there needed to be an  orderly transition  to  a democratic participatory government   to a condemnation of violence against the protesters            Obama came to rely upon Clinton s advice  organization and personal connections in the behind the scenes response to developments       As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region  Clinton was at the forefront of a U S  response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory  backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others         The London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya  March          As the Libyan Civil War took place  Clinton s shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power  This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates  security advisor Thomas E  Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for  and Arab and U N  approval of  the      military intervention in Libya                 Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya  despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution  The State Department s legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution s    day limit for unauthorized wars was passed  a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration        Clinton later used U S  allies and what she called  convening power  to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime       The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state       The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate                 During April       internal deliberations of the president s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U S  special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden  Clinton was among those who argued in favor  saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U S  relationship with Pakistan            Following the completion of the mission on May   resulting in bin Laden s death  Clinton played a key role in the administration s decision not to release photographs of the dead al Qaeda leader       During internal discussions regarding Iraq in       Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to               U S  troops there   All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U S  Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed               Clinton with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi during her December      visit to Myanmar In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December       Clinton said that   Gay rights are human rights   and that the U S  would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gay people abroad       The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U S  secretary of state since       She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the      Burmese democratic reforms            She also said the   st century would be  America s Pacific century        a declaration that was part of the Obama administration s  pivot to Asia        During the Syrian Civil War  Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform  As government violence allegedly rose in August       they called for him to resign from the presidency       The administration joined several countries in delivering non lethal assistance to so called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria       During mid       Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels  The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict  fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets            In December       Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus       Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier  as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe            The clot  which caused no immediate neurological injury  was treated with anticoagulant medication  and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery            l   Overall themes  Clinton  along with members of the national security team  receive an update on Operation Neptune Spear in the White House Situation Room on May          Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex  Throughout her time in office  and mentioned in her final speech concluding it   Clinton viewed  smart power  as the strategy for asserting U S  leadership and values  In a world of varied threats  weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities  smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U S  soft power capacities in global economics  development aid  technology  creativity and human rights advocacy            As such  she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach       In debates over use of military force  she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration                 In August      she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U S  response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action       Clinton greatly expanded the State Department s use of social media  including Facebook and Twitter  to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis   vis their governments       And in the Mideast turmoil  Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure  the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide       Moreover  in a formulation that became known as the  Hillary Doctrine   she viewed women s rights as critical for U S  security interests  due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state  and the instability and challenge to international security of that state            In turn  there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities  and in some cases feeling safer  as the result of her actions and visibility       Clinton visited     countries during her tenure  making her the most widely traveled secretary of state      m   Time magazine wrote that  Clinton s endurance is legendary         The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor  she believed that in person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age       As early as March       she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re elected in            in December       following that re election  Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton s successor       Her last day as secretary of state was February               Upon her departure  analysts commented that Clinton s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished            and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect       She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State        Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings See also       Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi  Obama and Clinton honor the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony  held at Andrews Air Force Base on September          On September           the U S  diplomatic mission in Benghazi  Libya  was attacked  resulting in the deaths of the U S  Ambassador  J  Christopher Stevens and three other Americans  The attack  questions surrounding the security of the U S  consulate  and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U S       On October     Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events            On December     a panel led by Thomas R  Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter  It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment       It focused its criticism on the department s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs  four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence       Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations       Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January           regarding the Benghazi attack  She defended her actions in response to the incident  and while still accepting formal responsibility  said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security       Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points  to which she responded  In particular  after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate  talking points  after the attack  Clinton responded with the much quoted rejoinder   With all due respect  the fact is we had four dead Americans  Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they d they go kill some Americans  What difference at this point does it make  It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again  Senator             In November       the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration s response to the attack       The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May      and conducted a two year investigation related to the      attack       Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics            This was especially the case in September       when House majority leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton s poll numbers  thereby contradicting the Republicans  previous talking points on the investigation            On October           Clinton testified at an all day and nighttime session before the committee            The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves       Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing  because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy  meandering  repetitive line of questioning from the committee       The committee issued competing final reports in June      that broke along partisan lines       The Republican report offered some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton        Email scandal Main article  Hillary Clinton email controversy A controversy arose in March       when the State Department s inspector general revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non government  privately maintained server exclusively instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state  Some experts  officials  members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures  and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements       The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton s      presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi            In a joint statement released on July           the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent  remained so at the time of their inspection and  never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system   They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems  Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house       Government policy  reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance  is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such       After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so called  born classified  category  an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server       The New York Times reported in February      that nearly       emails stored on Clinton s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department       Additionally  the intelligence community s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails  contained classified State Department information when originated        In May       the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state  stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked       Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent  In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February          Clinton said   I never sent or received any classified material they are retroactively classifying it   On July          Clinton stated   Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now  I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified             On July          the FBI concluded its investigation  In a statement  FBI director James Comey said       e mails in    e mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received  Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent     chains contained Secret information at the time  and eight contained Confidential information  which is the lowest level of classification  Separate from those  about       additional e mails were  up classified  to make them Confidential  the information in those had not been classified at the time the e mails were sent            Out of         three emails were found to be marked as classified  although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small  c  in parentheses  described as  portion markings  by Comey  He also said it was possible Clinton was not  technically sophisticated  enough to understand what the three classified markings meant       The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States  both sending and receiving work related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries  Comey acknowledged that it was  possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton s personal email account   He added that   although  we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information  there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information   Nevertheless  Comey asserted that  no reasonable prosecutor  would bring criminal charges in this case  despite the existence of  potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information   The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute       On July          U S  Attorney General Loretta Lynch who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June              confirmed that the probe into Clinton s use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges       On October           Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails  Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner  husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin  to a    year old girl in North Carolina  they discovered emails related to Clinton s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner  On November    Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July       The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the      presidential election       The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the      presidential election                 In September       the State Department finished its internal review into        emails that Clinton had turned over  The investigation that began in      found     violations of security procedures and found that Clinton s use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information  In    cases  the culpability of sending classified information could be attributed to    people  but the review concluded there was  no persuasive evidence of systemic  deliberate mishandling of classified information              Clinton Foundation  Hard Choices  and speeches Main articles  Clinton Foundation and Hard Choices  Clinton in September      When Clinton left the State Department  she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years       She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill  Hillary   Chelsea Clinton Foundation in            There she focused on early childhood development efforts  including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a      million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide  led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard            In       Clinton published a second memoir  Hard Choices  which focused on her time as secretary of state  As of July      update   the book has sold about         copies       Clinton also led the No Ceilings  The Full Participation Project  a partnership with the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in            its March      report said that while  There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman     this data shows just how far we still have to go        The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments  which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state  n  However  even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments  they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments       She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit       There she received                  per engagement  often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions            She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation       For the fifteen months ending in March       Clinton earned over     million from her speeches       For the overall period          the Clintons earned almost      million  paid some     million in federal and state taxes and donated about     million to charity       As of      update   she was estimated to be worth over     million on her own  or        million with her husband       Clinton resigned from the board of the foundation in April       when she began her presidential campaign  The

Democratic Party presidential candidates       Democratic Party presidential primaries  and      Democratic National Committee email leak On April           Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the      election       She had a campaign in waiting already in place  including a large donor network  experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure       Prior to her campaign  Clinton had claimed in an interview on NDTV in May      that she would not seek the presidency again  but later wrote in her      autobiography Hard Choices that she had not decided            The campaign s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn       Her campaign focused on  raising middle class incomes  establishing universal preschool  making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act            Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination       Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U S  and contrasted with Clinton s Wall Street ties            In the initial contest of the primaries season  Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses  held February    over an increasingly popular Sanders            the first woman to win them       In the first primary  held in New Hampshire on February    she lost to Sanders by a wide margin       Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest  the Nevada caucuses on February          but Clinton managed a five percentage point win  aided by final days campaigning among casino workers       Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February          These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her      effort       On March   Super Tuesday  Clinton won seven of eleven contests  including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed  as in South Carolina  by African American voters  She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders       She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season  with a consistent pattern throughout  Sanders did better among younger  whiter  more rural and more liberal voters and states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents  Clinton did better among older  black and Hispanic voter populations  and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats                 By June          she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee       On June    after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries  Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party       By campaign s end  Clinton had won       pledged delegates to Sanders         with an estimated     superdelegates compared to Sanders           She received almost    million votes during the nominating process  as opposed to Sanders     million         Clinton  accepting Senator Bernie Sanders  endorsement in New Hampshire  July      Clinton was

of vice presidential running mate  Senator Tim Kaine  was nominated by the convention the following day       Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump  Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party  Around the time of the convention  WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton s favor  Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of       In early July  Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI s conclusion of its investigation into her emails            FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been  extremely careless  in her handling of classified government material       In late July  Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention  This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since       although it was toward the low side by historical standards                 Following Clinton s seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention  she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August            In fall       Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together  which outlined their vision for the United States         Clinton delivering her

votes  with     needed to win  media sources proclaimed him the winner       Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory  whereupon Trump gave his victory speech       The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss  but called on her supporters to accept Trump as their next president  saying   We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead        Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only     electoral votes to Trump s      she won the popular vote by more than     million votes  or      of the

out a detailed economic plan  which The New York Times called  optimistic  and  wide ranging   Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism  Clinton proposed a  clawback  that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas  providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees  communities and the environment  rather than focusing on short term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders  increasing collective bargaining rights  and placing an  exit tax  on companies that move their headquarters out of America to

She opposed and criticized Trump s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States       Expressing support for Common Core      she said   The really unfortunate argument that s been going on around Common Core  it s very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort  It was actually nonpartisan  It wasn t politicized     Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time  And  speaking to Iowans  you see the value of it  you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system  And a lot of states unfortunately haven t had that and so don t understand the value of a core  in this sense a Common Core        On foreign affairs  Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq

attending various churches throughout her lifetime and all are part of the United Methodist Church    First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge  Illinois   in her early life  First United Methodist Church of Little Rock  Arkansas   while in Arkansas  Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington  D C    as the first lady of the United States  Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York  New York   currently a congregant   Clinton discussed her faith at      United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville  Kentucky       However  she has seldom discussed her faith while campaigning            She has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions  discussing for example the importance of loving one s neighbor as oneself  of helping the poor and  creating opportunities for others to be lifted up        Clinton has also expressed disappointment that  Christianity  which has such great love at its core  is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly        Professor Paul Kengor  author of God and Hillary Clinton  A Spiritual Life has suggested that Clinton s political positions are rooted in her faith  She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley   Do all the good you can  by all the means you can  in all the ways you can        In fact  Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the      Democratic National Convention  adding that her mother Dorothy  made sure I learned  these  words from our Methodist faith         Cultural and political image Main article  Cultural and political image of Hillary Clinton  Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years  Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as the first lady  Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton  A      survey by the New York Observer found  a virtual cottage industry  of  anti Clinton literature  put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints  Some titles include Madame Hillary  The Dark Road to the White House  Hillary s Scheme  Inside the Next Clinton s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped   Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless     Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well       other than her memoirs and those of her husband   When she ran for Senate in       several fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her       Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable  bogeyman  to mention in fundraising letters  on a par with Ted Kennedy  and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich       Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives  In       writer Todd S  Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test       an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan  who said   Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society        She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live  beginning with her time as the first lady  She has made guest appearances on the show herself  in      and in       to face off with her doppelg ngers            Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her including  The Hillary Shimmy Song   which went viral                        Clinton in April      She has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure  though some argue otherwise       In the early stages of her      presidential campaign  a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled  Love Her    Hate Her        Mother Jones titled its profile of her  Harpy  Hero  Heretic  Hillary        Following Clinton s  choked up moment  and related incidents in the run up to the January      New Hampshire primary  both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse            Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events   brought an odd truth to light  though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades     she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics        Once she became secretary of state  Clinton s image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure            Her favorability ratings dropped  however  after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more       By September       with her      presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department  her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever       During      she acknowledged that   I m not a natural politician  in

had not legally changed her name from Hillary Rodham       Bill Clinton s advisers thought her use of her maiden name to be one of the reasons for his      gubernatorial re election loss  During the following winter  Vernon Jordan suggested to Hillary Rodham that she start using the name Clinton  and she began to do so publicly with her husband s February      campaign announcement to regain that office  She later wrote   I learned the hard way that some voters in Arkansas were seriously offended by the fact that I kept my maiden name        Once he was elected again  she made a point of using  Hillary Rodham Clinton  in work she did as First Lady of the state      Once she became first lady of the United States in       she publicly stated that she wanted to be known as  Hillary Rodham Clinton        She has authored all her books under that name  She continued to use that name on her website and elsewhere once she was a U S  senator       When she ran for president during          she used the name  Hillary Clinton  or just  Hillary  in campaign materials       She used  Hillary Rodham Clinton  again in official materials as secretary of state       As of the      launch of her second presidential campaign  she again switched to using  Hillary Clinton  in campaign materials       in November      both the Associated Press and The New York Times noted that they would no longer use  Rodham  in referring to Clinton  with the Times stating that  the Clinton campaign confirmed     that Mrs  Clinton prefers to be simply   Hillary Clinton            Clinton said in the joint    Minutes interview   I m not sitting here as some little woman  standing by my man  like Tammy Wynette  I m sitting here because I love him and I respect him  and I honor what he s been through and what we ve been through together   The seemingly sneering reference to country music provoked immediate criticism that Clinton was culturally tone deaf  and Tammy Wynette herself did not like the remark because  Stand by Your Man  is not written in the first person       Wynette added that Clinton had  offended every true country music fan and every person who has  made it on their own  with no one to take them to a White House        A few days later  on Primetime Live  Hillary Clinton apologized to Wynette  Clinton would later write that she had been careless in her choice of words and that  the fallout from my reference to Tammy Wynette was instant as it deserved to be and brutal        The two women later resolved their differences  with Wynette appearing at a Clinton fundraiser     Less than two months after the Tammy Wynette remarks  Clinton was facing questions about whether she could have avoided possible conflicts of interest between her governor husband and work given to the Rose Law Firm when she remarked   I ve done the best I can to lead my life     You know  I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas  but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession  which I entered before my husband was in public life        The  cookies and teas  part of this statement prompted even more culture based criticism of Clinton s apparent distaste for women who had chosen to be homemakers  the remark became a recurring campaign liability       Clinton subsequently offered up some cookie recipes as a way of making amends and would later write of her chagrin   Besides  I ve done quite a lot of cookie baking in my life  and tea pouring too           The Eleanor Roosevelt  discussions  were first reported in      by The Washington Post writer Bob Woodward  they had begun from the start of Hillary Clinton s time as first lady       Following the Democrats  loss of congressional control in the      elections  Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent Jean Houston  Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection  and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton  critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding s ances with Eleanor Roosevelt  The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise  and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations  with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible       In her      autobiography  Clinton titled an entire chapter  Conversations with Eleanor   and stated that holding  imaginary conversations  is  actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems  provided you choose the right person to visualize  Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal           Clinton was referring to the Arkansas Project and its funder Richard Mellon Scaife  Kenneth Starr s connections to Scaife  Regnery Publishing and its connections to Lucianne Goldberg and Linda Tripp  Jerry Falwell  and others          General Jack Keane  one of the architects of the surge  later related that he tried to convince Clinton of its merits at the time  but that she felt it would not succeed and that U S  casualties would be too high  Keane said that sometime during      she told him   You were right  this really did work        In       Secretary of Defense Gates related that after Clinton had left the Senate and become Secretary of State  she told President Obama that her opposition to the      Iraq surge had been political  due to her facing a strong challenge from the anti Iraq War Obama in the upcoming Democratic presidential primary  Gates also quotes Clinton as saying   The Iraq surge worked        Clinton responded that Gates had misinterpreted her remark regarding the reason for her opposition          When asked for her reaction to an Obama remark about the possibility that his campaign represented false hope  Clinton responded   I would point to the fact that Dr  King s dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of       when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do  the President before had not even tried  but it took a president to get it done  That dream became a reality  the power of that dream became real in people s lives because we had a president who said we are going to do it  and actually got it accomplished                 Democratic Popular Vote   RealClearPolitics  Retrieved July          The popular vote count for a nomination process is unofficial  and meaningless in determining the nominee  It is difficult to come up with precise totals due to some caucus states not reporting popular vote totals and thus having to be estimated  It is also difficult to compare Clinton and Obama s totals  due to only her name having been on the ballot in the Michigan primary          These efforts were not immediately rewarded  largely due to the unpopularity of drone attacks in Pakistan and other U S  anti terrorism actions  Polls in Pakistan and other Muslim countries showed approval of the U S  declined among its citizens between      and       Confidence that Clinton was doing the right thing in world affairs was also low  The confidence ratings for Clinton were high in most European countries and generally mixed in the BRIC countries          While generally experiencing good health in her life  Clinton had previously had a potentially serious blood clot behind her knee  a deep vein thrombosis  while first lady in       for which she had required anticoagulant treatment       An elbow fracture and subsequent painful recuperation had caused Clinton to miss two foreign trips as Secretary of State in            It was also disclosed in      that she had a second deep vein thrombosis in            The      concussion and clot episode caused Clinton to postpone her congressional testimony on the Benghazi attack and to miss any foreign trips planned for the rest of her tenure       After returning to public activity  she wore special glasses for two months  with a Fresnel lens for the left eye to compensate for double vision  a lingering effect of the concussion            She remained on anticoagulant medication as a precaution          Clinton s     countries visited broke Madeleine Albright s previous mark of          Clinton s sum of         air miles traveled  however  fell short of Condoleezza Rice s record for mileage       That total             was bolstered late in her tenure by repeated trips to the Middle East          a b During Clinton s tenure there were several cases where foreign governments continued making donations to the Clinton Foundation at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary of state  which was permissible under the agreement forged before she took office  There was one instance of a new donation           from Algeria for earthquake relief in Haiti  that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special State Department ethics review but did not       The foundation s new stance as of April      update  and Clinton s presidential candidacy was to accept foreign governmental donations only from Australia  Canada  Germany  the Netherlands  Norway and the United Kingdom          The others were Andrew Jackson who lost to John Quincy Adams  Samuel Tilden who lost by one electoral vote to Rutherford B Hayes  Grover Cleveland who lost to Benjamin Harrison  and Al Gore who lost to George W Bush     See Barone  Michael  Cohen  Richard E          The Almanac of American Politics  National Journal  p        And      edition of same
