journalism into the democratic process  The media not only informs the public  but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate  The civic journalism movement is an attempt to abandon the notion that journalists and their audiences are spectators in political and social processes  In its place  the civic journalism movement seeks to treat readers and community members as participants   Contents    Overview   History   Definition   Civic journalism in recent years   The evolution of civic journalism   Goals   Related concepts   Political journalism   Main tenets

philosophy as it is a practice  Civic journalism has began to develop a strong following again after first emerging as a philosophy in the late     s and early     s  Those who find civic journalism to be a new  progressive  and profound method for the media to engage with the public see it as an opportunity to revitalize democracy as we know it  As technological advances overtake the modern world  it is becoming less common for the general public to buy newspapers or watch TV news to inform themselves on the events in the political sphere  Including this  younger generations  such as Generation X  Generation Y  and even Millennials  are not coming out to the polls due to a variety of reasons  Overall  democracy is beginning to fail as there is a lack of civic engagement and even interference with democratic processes  such as Russia s involvement with the      United States election  and even electronic voting  e voting  machines that are being hacked and altering results  All in all  proponents of civic journalism believe that for democracy to regain its traction and glory in the modern world  the media must be more receptive to feedback from the public and take initiative to engage the public as well  According to Oxford Research Encyclopedias  the popularity of political journalism is rising  and the area is becoming one of the more dominant domains of journalism  Political journalism is meant to be more of an overseer of democratic process as they relate to civic engagement rather than a scapegoat for the issues with democracy  Including this  there are four key concepts that political journalism can be boiled down to  These concepts are the framing of politics as a strategic game  interpretive versus straight news  conflict framing and media negativity  and finally  political or partisan bias  In essence  these can be viewed as the four quintessential pillars of civic journalism   History edit  In the     s  before the notion of public journalism was developed  there was the famous debate between Walter Lippmann and John Dewey over the role of journalism in a democracy  Lippmann viewed the role of the journalist to be simply recording what policy makers say and then providing that information to the public  In opposition to this  Dewey defined the journalist s role as being more engaged with the public and critically examining information given by the government  He thought journalists should weigh the consequences of the policies being enacted  Dewey believed conversation  debate  and dialogue were what democracy was all about and that journalism has an important piece of that conversation  Decades later Dewey s argument was further explored by Jay Rosen and Davis Merritt  who were looking at the importance of the media in the democratic process  In       Rosen and Merritt formed the concept of public journalism  In their joint  manifesto  on public journalism that was published in       Rosen explains that  public journalism  tries to place the journalist within the political community as a responsible member with a full stake in public life  But it does not deny the important difference between journalists and other actors including political leaders  interest groups and citizens themselves   In a word  public journalists want public life to work  In order to make it work they are willing to declare an end to their neutrality on certain questions   for example  whether a community comes to grips with its problems  whether political earns the attention it claims        Picture of Jay Rosen  a professor of journalism at New York University  According to communication scholar Seong Jae Min  it was actually in the     s when this conversation style of journalism   gained significant traction in both academia and the professional world of journalism      He reports that the rise of this idea combined with ongoing dissent over traditional journalistic practice lead to the movement of public journalism   This new journalistic movement was born to defeat the plagues of modern democracy in which citizens are alienated from the civic life and reduced to passive voters      He later admits that this movement was superficially prescriptive  and that due to several reasons it was eclipsed by the movement for citizen journalism      Definition edit  According to the now dormant Pew Center for Civic Journalism  the practice  is both a philosophy and a set of values supported by some evolving techniques to reflect both of those in journalism  At its heart is a belief that journalism has an obligation to public life   an obligation that goes beyond just telling the news or unloading lots of facts  The way we do our journalism affects the way public life goes       Leading organizations in the field include the now dormant Pew Center  the Kettering Foundation  the Participatory Journalism Interest Group  formerly named the Civic and Citizen Journalism Interest Group  in the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication  AEJMC  and the Public Journalism Network  Although they developed the concept of public journalism together  both Rosen and Merritt have differing viewpoints on what exactly public journalism is  Rosen defines public journalism as a way of thinking about the business of the craft that calls on journalists to     address people as citizens  potential participants in public affairs  rather than victims or spectators      help the political community act upon  rather than just learn about  its problems      improve the climate of public discussion  rather than simply watch it deteriorate  and     help make public life go well  so that it earns its claim on our attention and     speak honestly about its civic values  its preferred view of politics  its role as a public actor     Rosen explains five ways to understand public journalism   As an argument  a way of thinking about what journalist should be doing  given their own predicament and general state of public life     As an experiment  a way of breaking out of established routines and making a different kind of contribution to public life     As a movement involving practicing journalists  former journalists who want to improve their craft  academics and researchers with ideas to lend and studies that might help  foundations and think tanks that gave financial assistance and sanctuary to the movement  and other like minded folk who wanted to contribute to the rising spirit of reform     As a debate with often heated conversation within the press and with others outside it about the proper role of the press     As an adventure  an open ended and experimental quest for another kind of press     Merritt  on the other hand  explains that it is the responsibility of the journalist to act as a fair minded participant in the public arena  His famous analogy of the journalist having the same role as a sports referee best depicts this idea  The function of a third party   a referee or umpire or judge   in sports competition is to facilitate the deciding of the outcome  Ideally  the official impinges on the game  if things go according to the rules  he or she is neither seen nor heard  Yet the presence of a fair minded participant is necessary in order for an equitable decision to be reached  What he or she brings to the arena is knowledge of the agreed upon rules  the willingness to contribute that knowledge  and authority   that is  the right to be attended to  The referee s role is to make sure that the process works as the contestants agreed it should  In order to maintain that authority  that right to be heard  the referee must exhibit no interest in the final score other than it is arrived at under the rules  But  both for referees and contestants  that is the ultimate interest  It is important to remember that the referee doesn t make the rules  Those are agreed on by the contestants   in this case  the democratic public  The referee  rather  is the fair minded caretaker  What journalist should bring to the arena of public life is knowledge of the rules   how the public has decided a democracy should work and the ability and the willingness to provide relevant information and a lace for that information to be discussed and turned into democratic consent  Like the referee  to maintain our authority   the right to be heard   we must exhibit no partisan interest in the specific outcome other than it is arrived at under the democratic process     In a National Public Radio interview Merritt summed up civic journalism as  a set of values about the craft that recognizes and acts upon the interdependence between journalism and democracy  It values the concerns of citizens over the needs of the media and political actors  and conceives of citizens as stakeholders in the democratic process rather than as merely victims  spectators or inevitable adversaries  As inherent participants in the process  we should do our work in ways that aid in the resolution of public problems by fostering broad citizen engagement       Civic journalism in recent years edit  In recent history  civic journalism has played an important role in the development of society  This is seen as civic journalism has adopted a more holistic approach towards recognizing the need for criminal justice reform  societal improvement  enhanced professional capacity  and strengthened institutions that support free speech and development of technological infrastructure     Specifically  civic journalism has played a major role in the development of countries by helping spur democratic transitions  encouraging economic growth  conducting public health campaigns  and imposing accountability of politicians     For instance  in Guadalajeara  Mexico  the local media played a major role in keeping the Mexican government accountable in their role behind an explosion in      that killed over     people     Similarly  in       many journalists worked to expose Apple s working conditions in Chinese factories      Many believe the role that civic journalists play in keeping politicians and corporations in check is one of their most important functions      Additionally  civic journalism can help form political agendas  and can have a policy agenda setting effect            The evolution of civic journalism edit  Civic journalism continues to rapidly evolve over time  The future of civic journalism appears fluid  However  it is speculated to consist of privately owned  independent media     This is a far cry from the past  where the majority of news outlets were publicly owned  Many believe that the presence of many private media companies operating in a single country is one of the best ways to increase the effectiveness of democracy     As civic journalism evolves  its effect on society changes as well  Civic journalism plays a major role in daily life  Many studies identify a positive relationship between engagement with civic journalism and increased civic participation in local communities       One of the first instances of civic journalism being widely used is in politics is Barack Obama s presidential campaign           As the world becomes more interconnected through the internet  so does civic journalism  With access to the internet at an all time high      people are more able to interact with civic journalism media outlets  giving them access to vast amounts of information      However  with information so widespread and available  ethical questions arise to challenge journalistic integrity  The concerns about ethics in civic journalism becomes a contentious one  as it can become quickly polarized      These debates plague the civic journalism community and force them to evaluate what their approach to journalism is  In recent years  some have questioned the ethics of prominent media conglomerates  such as Facebook  and the role they play in civic journalism  Many have suggested possible solutions or guidelines to ethical journalism  such as frameworks for ethical lobbying       however the law remains inconclusive    With the internet having greater influence in civic journalism  social media outlets are starting to play a bigger role in civic journalism as well  The future of civic journalism is moving digital as more and more media moves away from a traditional medium  For instance  in the wake of the      Boston Marathon bombings  traditional news channels relied heavily on videos  pictures  and comments from social media platforms for coverage of the event      Similarly  ethical concerns regarding civic journalism on social media arise as our laws are not always well equipped to handle emerging issues regarding data privacy      censorship      and other contemporary subjects                                            Goals edit  The goal of civic journalism  or public journalism  is to allow the community to remain engaged with journalists and news outlets  restore democratic values  and rebuild the public s trust in journalists  The ubiquity of  fake news  and biased reporting in the modern media landscape has led to an overall decrease in the trust that people put in journalists and media sources  Proponents of civic journalism believe that this philosophy will allow individuals to have a greater say in decision making and in the broader political sphere  Given the rise in yellow journalism and search engine optimization algorithms that create an echo chamber among mass media  civic journalism is entering a niche role where it can shift the position of news within public reception  Recently  news publishers undergo more and more observation as their ethics and content come under extensive scrutiny for political biases  Civic journalism pivots the role of publishers from distributing information to curating information  Given one of civic journalism s central tenets   making the press a forum for discussion of community issues   a publisher is able to seek out a niche in bolstering local engagement over spreading knowledge of international issues readily available on the Internet   Related concepts edit  Citizen journalism is variety of journalism that is conducted by people who are not simply professional journalists  but who convey information by using social media and various blog posts  Recently  citizen journalism has expanded its worldwide influence despite continuing concerns over whether citizen journalists are as reliable as true  well practiced journalists  The goal of citizen journalists is to increase civic engagement  similar to how the goal civic journalism is to increases civic engagement  Citizen journalists may be influencers as opposed to accredited journalists  but still have a substantial means of conveying their message to the general public   Political journalism edit  As previously mentioned  a similar concept to civic journalism is political journalism  Political journalism has four key pillars  which are the framing of politics as a strategic game  conflict framing and media negativity  interpretive versus straight news  and political or partisan bias  These four pillars are integral to the ideology as a whole  Political journalism relates to civic journalism in that it is a movement towards democratizing the media to partake in the voting process      Political journalism s first pillar  the framing of politics as a strategic game  is meant to signify how politics should not simply be seen as a simple election process for democracies  In order to win  one must play the game well  Civic journalism and political journalism are meant to be tools for successful democratic elections in viewing politics as a strategic game  This is mainly due to the fact that they both encourage constituents to voice their opinions so that politicians are more representative of the true whole  The second pillar is conflict framing and media negativity  due to the fact that information portrayed in the media can often be skewed or false  Political journalism offers an avenue to resolve this issue and eliminates potential conflicts of interest  The third pillar is interpretative versus straight news  Often  the way that information is portrayed is not entirely neutral  and has some bias  Media sources may leave the implications or ramifications of a certain news event up to interpretation by the viewer  An idea that relates to this is interpretive journalism  or interpretive reporting  which requires a journalist to go beyond the basic facts related to a news event and provide a deeper analysis or coverage of an event      Finally  the last pillar is political or partisan bias  which in a sense relates to the rest of these pillars as well  Political or partisan bias refers to the non neutrality of news coverage or general political occurrences  Often  when politicians speak they are heavily biased  and it is up to the individual to determine whether to believe what they are hearing  Political and civic journalism provide an avenue for the media and the general public to integrate into the democratic process to promote transparency   Main tenets edit  According to The Roots of Civic Journalism by David K  Perry      the practitioners of civic journalism   who saw the movement s most drastic growth in the early     s   have always adhered to the basic tenets of public journalism    Attempting to situate newspapers and journalists as active participants in community life  rather than as detached spectators    Making a newspaper a forum for discussion of community issues    Favoring the issues  events and problems important to ordinary people    Considering public opinion through the process of discussion and debate among members of a community    Attempting to use journalism to enhance social capital   Structure edit  Usually formulated by a few devoted members in a newsroom  civic journalism projects are typically associated with the opinion section of papers   These projects are usually found in the form of organized town meetings and adult education programs  The Public Journalism Network explains that  journalism and democracy work best when news  information and ideas flow freely  when news portrays the full range and variety of life and culture of all communities  when public deliberation is encouraged and amplified  and when news helps people function as political actors and not just as political consumers        Key proponents and opponents edit  Civic journalism is a polarizing philosophy  according to the University of Nebraska Lincoln College of Journalism and Mass Communications  Proponents believe integrating journalism into the democratic process helps inform voters and makes them more aware of what is occurring in the political sphere  It may make a difference in the democratic process if all voters are well informed  Civic journalism itself is the process of integrating journalism into the democratic process and allowing voters and the media to play a more active role rather than being witnesses and bystanders of political events  Opponents find civic journalism to be risky and ineffective and believe it brings about conflicts of interest and necessitates involvement in unethical public affairs  Notable proponents of civic journalism include   John Bender  assistant professor of new editorial at the University of Nebraska Lincoln  claims that journalists who are the most esteemed and high regarded play active roles in helping their community thrive  David Mathews  president of the Kettering Foundation and a supporter of civic journalism states that   when people are in the business of making choices  are going to look for information to inform their choices   Mathews affirms that civic journalism is aimed at aligning journalistic practices with the ways that citizens form publics  in turn creating a more efficient and reciprocal way of communicating with readers  Jay Rosen  a journalism professor at New York University  is one of the earliest proponents of civic journalism   From      to       Rosen wrote and spoke frequently about civic journalism   He published his book  What Are Journalists For  in      about the  early rise of the civic journalism movement      Rosen writes a popular blog called PressThink  W  Davis  Buzz  Merritt Jr   a former editor of The Wichita Eagle  is another pioneer of civic journalism   Merritt is a key advocate for news media reforms  and published his book Public Journalism and Public Life in        Merritt began exploring civic journalism after acknowledging loss of public trust in traditional journalistic values   Merritt feels that journalists need a clear understanding and appreciation for the interdependence of journalism and democracy  James W  Carey  a media critic and a journalism instructor at Columbia University  was an advocate for the public journalism movement  He saw it as a  reawakening of an antecedent tradition of journalism and politics  one that emphasizes local democracy  the community of locale  and citizenship as against the distant forces that would overwhelm it   public journalism performs a great service in reminding us what is work protecting       Seong Jae Min states that the idea of public or civic journalism is a notion that the press not only informs the public  but also works toward engaging citizens and creating public debate  It was  about problem solving for the public rather than truth seeking   But it eventually faltered for several reasons  public journalism lacked clear conceptual definitions  ignored news businesses  commercial interests  and its effort was artificial  surrounded by many textbook  normative parameters of deliberative democracy  public journalists imposed shared values and goals on citizens to force problem solving and public judgment      Case studies edit  Citizen Voices The Citizen Voices Project was one newspaper s attempt to facilitate civic conversation within the diverse city of Philadelphia  Citizen Voices came into effect in       during a very close mayoral election between a black democrat and a white republican  Citizen Voices was modeled on the National Issues Forum and was intended to amplify minority voices not frequently acknowledged in the political realm  Forums were held throughout the city  facilitating deliberation of the most important issues facing citizens  jobs  neighborhoods  public safety  and reforming city hall  Essays written by Citizen Voices participants were published in the commentary pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer  while the editorial board framed its coverage of the campaign around the five designated issues   While the Citizen Voices Project did not increase voter turnout  it has given journalists a new perspective on how to cover urban political issues   The Front Porch Forum was introduced in Seattle in      through a partnership between the Seattle Times newspaper  KUOW FM radio station and the Pew Center for Civic Journalism   The mission of the Front Porch Forum was to strengthen communities through news coverage that focuses on citizens  concerns  encourages civic participation  improves public deliberation and reconnects citizens  candidates and reporters to community life   Over the course of     years  the Seattle Times and KUOW FM featured a series of stories highlighting issues that affect Seattle residents  and encouraged readers  participation  Critical thinking in Public Journalism   Public conversation imagined in public journalism was rigid and artificial  Public journalism placed a high premium on consensus and civility  it has made no space for social movements and settled for a demure  middle class conception of public life       See also edit    Journalism portal References edit      Rosen  Jay         What Are Journalists For
