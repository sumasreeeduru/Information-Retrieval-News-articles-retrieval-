        Burman stated that the recent decision by the government of Stephen Harper to sever diplomatic relations with Iran was evidence that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is Canada s  new foreign minister  His day job may be prime minister of Israel  but Canada s abrupt actions against Iran seem to confirm that the Harper government s outsourcing of Canada s Middle East policy to Jerusalem is now complete   He further stated that  There is little else to conclude from Canada s unwise decision to move unilaterally on Iran at this moment  Burman wrote that the Canadian government has adopted a  passionate pro Israeli stance  and  has gained the reputation throughout the Middle East of being a passionate warrior on behalf of Israel s foreign ministry   Burman cited  references in the Israeli media about Canada s unwavering support of the Israeli government  to support his claim  He concluded the article by stating that  reflecting on its recent actions  we may have to wait until our government checks with its new foreign minister in Jerusalem before we get some answers         Recent scholarship edit  Burman  T          World Perspectives  Ignoring the World at our Peril  In J  Owen   H  Purdey  International News Reporting  Frontlines and Deadlines  pp            West Sussex  UK  John Wiley   Thoughts on journalism edit  Credibility   Every news organization has only its credibility and reputation to rely on       Public Broadcasting   It s sad there is no tradition of public service broadcasting in the U S   a country of     million people  beyond PBS  It s a problem for us all     If there is a resurgence in public service broadcasting  hopefully it will be universal       Supporting Democracy   We believe that informed citizenship benefits from the expression of the fullest range of responsible opinion on important issues  rather than artificially limiting the spectrum of debate to favour one particular perspective    however apparently right and justified it may be  At the end of the day  we trust our  audiences  to draw their own conclusions       New Trends   In the days ahead    the challenge for established newspapers  broadcast networks and websites is to come up with ways of harnessing the power and wisdom of the audience in a way that adheres to professional ethics and accepted journalistic policy  In other words  a genuine partnership    and one that is more methodical than simply tossing people small cameras or microphones and then wishing for the best       New Trends   More than ever  audiences are determining how the media will evolve  They want news  information and much of their media on their terms on a variety of platforms    whether TV  radio  newspapers  laptops  personal organizers  cellphones or iPods  And they want a genuine two way relationship with their content providers that is more than simply sitting back and absorbing     They want to respond  engage and create    to be contributors  not merely consumers       Credibility   Credibility cannot be achieved overnight  But public broadcasters must conduct journalism in an open and accountable way     If you find that the news is only gossip and irrelevant to public interest  avoid going into it       Supporting Democracy   There is no more important contribution that we can make to society than strong  publicly spirited investigative journalism       In a Crisis   the role of the media    is to try to separate fact from fiction  to help our audiences understand what is happening and why   and to respond to the unfolding drama  as best we can under the circumstances  in a way that makes sense of it all     To connect the dots  knowing full well that horrific events are rarely random       New Trends   We re heading into a world where we re all going to become content providers  not TV stations  not newspapers  not radio stations     Our reporters will no longer be radio reporters or TV reporters   that particular T shirt will be put aside and there will be far more contributions to the web  far more mixing and movement among the various networks and platforms          New Trends   I have always felt that an openness to change and renewal is at the core of the best journalism       International News   I have a feeling that  as we look ahead five to    years from now  that we ll look back at      as being very much a turning point for American democracy  So  it s important that not only Americans understand what is going on  but also those of us outside of America       Public Broadcasting   there s more to journalism than simply the commercial aspect of it     I have incredible distrust and a skepticism about the commercial influences on journalism and on news organizations       International News      people care about what s in front of them  what s on their street and in their community  but that should not be at the expense of understanding the world  I think the financial meltdown was a reminder that what globalization means is a lot of the decisions that affect your life are made far from your community     You have to see the wider world and what kind of impact it s having on your lives  The only way you can do that is through the media  because the media provides a window on that world  And if those windows are shut by organizations that up till now provided international coverage  then people who are interested in the world have few places to go       International News   People need accurate information to make sensible choices about their lives  about the direction of their countries  An informed citizenry produces enlightened policies that benefit people generally  And the reverse is true when you have inaccurate information or you have sensationalism or distortion  that plays with people s minds and leads to bad decisions     I think that organizations like Al Jazeera     that are committed to accurate and full information  ultimately help society       Supporting Democracy   In the U S   the broadcast media in particular does a poor job of making crucial issues clear and relevant for Americans to understand  And I think that s a real threat to a functioning democracy       New Trends   We have always needed to rely on people in our audiences and in the public to be our eye witnesses  The challenge in our use of social media is to determine how to organize it and marshal it in ways that enrich our content and better serve our audiences  And we can do that by creating ways to double check and verify the accuracy of this information  We can t just put things on the air  on the Web or in print       New Trends   There is so much potential here in North America  compared to the developing world  because computers  smartphones and the Internet are everywhere  It s a way to enrich our coverage and capture a younger audience  But in the developing world  social media are being used far more to help people learn about their societies and figure out how to make them better  We should learn from that       References edit      Vukets  Cynthia                Toronto News  Former chief of CBC  Al
