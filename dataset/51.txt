       Corvette  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about a type of warship  For the car  see Chevrolet Corvette  For other uses  see Corvette  disambiguation   Small warship  Corvette Comandante Foscari of the Italian Navy A corvette is a small warship  It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper  or  rated   warship  The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate  while the class below was historically that of the sloop of war  The modern types of ship below a corvette are coastal patrol craft  missile boat and fast attack craft  In modern terms  a corvette is typically between     tons and       tons  although recent designs may approach       tons  which might instead be considered a small frigate  The word  corvette  is first found in Middle French  a diminutive of the Dutch word corf  meaning a  basket   from the Latin corbis     The rank  corvette captain   equivalent in many navies to  lieutenant commander   derives from the name of this type of ship  The rank is the most junior of three  captain  ranks in several European  e g   France  Spain  Italy  Croatia  and South American  e g   Argentina  Chile  Brazil  navies  because a corvette  as the smallest class of rated warship  was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a  captain  rank

smaller than a frigate and with a single deck of guns     They were very closely related to sloops of war  The role of the corvette consisted mostly of coastal patrol  fighting minor wars  supporting large fleets  or participating in show the flag missions  The English  Navy began using small ships in the     s  but described them as sloops rather than corvettes  The first reference to a corvette was with the French Navy in the     s  which may be where the term originated  The French Navy s corvettes grew over the decades and by the     s they were ships of    guns or so  approximately equivalent to the British Navy s post ships  The British Navy did not adopt the term until the     s  long after the Napoleonic Wars  to describe a small sixth rate vessel somewhat larger than a sloop  The last vessel lost by France during the American Revolutionary War was the corvette Le Dragon  scuttled by her captain to avoid capture off Monte Cristi  Ha ti in January          Most corvettes and sloops of the   th century were around    to    ft     to    m  in length and measured    to    tons burthen   They carried four to eight smaller guns on a single deck  Over time  vessels of increasing size and capability were called corvettes  by       they reached lengths of over     ft     m  and measured from     to     tons burthen   Steam ships edit   French steam corvette Dupleix             Ships during the steam era became much faster and more maneuverable than their sail ancestors  Corvettes during this era were typically used alongside gunboats during colonial missions  Battleships and other large vessels were unnecessary when fighting the indigenous people of the Far East and Africa   World War II edit  See also  List of corvettes of the Second World War The modern corvette appeared during World War II as an easily built patrol and convoy escort vessel     The British naval designer William Reed drew up a small ship based on the single shaft Smiths Dock Company whale catcher Southern Pride  whose simple design and mercantile construction standards lent itself to rapid production in large numbers in small yards unused to naval work  First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill  later Prime Minister  had a hand in reviving the name  corvette   During the arms buildup leading to World War II  the term  corvette  was almost attached to the Tribal class destroyer  The Tribals were so much larger than and sufficiently different from other British destroyers that some consideration was given to resurrecting the classification of  corvette  and applying it to them  This idea was dropped  and the term applied to small  mass produced antisubmarine escorts such as the Flower class of World War II    HMCS Regina  a Flower class corvette The first modern corvettes were the Flower class  Royal Navy ship were named after flowers  and ships in Royal Canadian Navy service took the name of smaller Canadian cities and towns   Their chief duty was to protect convoys throughout the Battle of the Atlantic and on the routes from the UK to Murmansk carrying supplies to the Soviet Union  The Flower class corvette was originally designed for offshore patrol work  and was not ideal when pressed into service as an antisubmarine escort  It was shorter than ideal for oceangoing convoy escort work  too lightly armed for antiaircraft defense  and the ships were barely faster than the merchantmen they escorted  This was a particular problem given the faster German U boat designs then emerging  Nonetheless the ship was quite seaworthy and maneuverable  but living conditions for ocean voyages were challenging  As a result of these shortcomings  the corvette was superseded in the Royal Navy as the escort ship of choice by the frigate  which was larger  faster  better armed  and had two shafts  However  many small yards could not produce vessels of frigate size  so an improved corvette design  the Castle class  was introduced later in the war  with some remaining in service until the mid     s  The Royal Australian Navy built    Bathurst class corvettes  including    for the Royal Navy crewed by Australians  and four for the Indian Navy  These were officially described as Australian minesweepers  or as minesweeping sloops by the Royal Navy  and were named after Australian towns  The Bird class minesweepers or trawlers were referred to as corvettes in the Royal New Zealand Navy  and two  Kiwi and Moa  rammed and sank a much larger Japanese submarine  I    in      in the Solomon Islands  In Italy  the Regia Marina  in dire need of escort vessels for its convoys  designed the Gabbiano class corvette  of which    were built between      and       out of    planned   they proved apt at operations in the Mediterranean Sea  especially in regards to their anti air and anti submarine capability  and were so successful that the class survived after the war into the Marina Militare Italiana until        Modern corvettes edit  Modern navies began a trend in the late   th and early   st centuries towards smaller more manoeuverable surface capability  Corvettes have a displacement between     and       long tons      and       t  and measure         ft         m  in length  They are usually armed with medium  and small calibre guns  surface to surface missiles  surface to air missiles  SAM   and anti submarine weapons  Many can accommodate a small or medium anti submarine warfare helicopter  Most countries with coastlines can build corvette sized ships  either as part of their commercial shipbuilding activities or in purpose built yards  but the sensors  weapons  and other systems required for a surface combatant are more specialized and are around     of the total cost   These components are purchased on the international market      Current corvette classes edit  Many countries today operate corvettes  some include Argentina     Bangladesh  Brazil  Bulgaria  China  Germany  Egypt  India  Indonesia  Iran  Israel  Italy  Norway  Pakistan  the Philippines  Poland  Portugal  Romania  Russia  Singapore  South Korea  Sweden  Malaysia  Turkey  and United Arab Emirates  Countries that border smaller seas  such as the Baltic Sea or the Persian Gulf  are more likely to build the smaller and more manoeuvrable corvettes  with Russia operating the most corvettes in the world    Argentine MEKO Espora class corvette  A Swedish Visby class stealth corvette  Corvette Braunschweig of the German Navy In the     s  the Portuguese Navy designed the Jo o Coutinho class corvettes as multi role small frigates intended to be affordable for a small navy  The Jo o Coutinho class would soon inspire a series of similar projects   including the Spanish Descubierta  the German MEKO      the French A   and the own Portuguese Baptista de Andrade   adopted by a number of medium and small sized navies  The first operational corvette based on stealth technology was the Royal Norwegian Navy s Skjold class  The Swedish Navy introduced the similarly stealthy Visby class  The United States is developing littoral combat ships  which are essentially large corvettes  their spacious hulls permitting space for mission modules  allowing them to undertake tasks formerly assigned to specialist classes such as minesweepers or the anti submarine Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate  The Israeli Navy operates three Sa ar   class corvettes  Built in the U S to an Israeli design  they carry one helicopter and are well armed with offensive and defensive weapons systems  including the Barak   SAM  and advanced electronic sensors and countermeasures  They displace over       tons at full load  The Indian Navy operates four Kamorta class corvettes built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers  All of them were in service by       The new German Navy Braunschweig class is designed to replace Germany s fast attack craft and also incorporates stealth technology and land attack capabilities  The Israeli Navy has ordered four Sa ar   class corvettes  a more heavily armed version of the type  deliveries commencing in       Turkey began to build M LGEM class corvettes in       The M LGEM class is designed for anti submarine warfare and littoral patrol duty  The lead ship  TCG Heybeliada  entered navy service in       The design concept and mission profile of the M LGEM class is similar to the Freedom class of littoral combat ships of the United States  Finland has plans to build four multi role corvettes  currently dubbed the Pohjanmaa class  in the     s as part of its navy s Project Squadron       The corvettes will have helicopter carrying  mine laying  ice breaking  anti aircraft and anti ship abilities  They will be over     metres      ft  long and cost a total of     billion euros  The Greek Navy has categorised the class as fast attack missile craft  A similar vessel is the K l   class fast attack missile craft of the Turkish Navy  which is classified as a corvette by L rssen Werft  the German ship designer  In       to replace the Ardhana class patrol boat  the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Defence awarded a contract to Abu Dhabi Ship Building for the Baynunah class of corvettes  This class is based on the CMN Group s Combattante BR   design  The Baynunah class is designed for patrol and surveillance  minelaying  interception and other anti surface warfare operations in the United Arab Emirates territorial waters and exclusive economic zone  The lead ship was launched on June           Sea trials commenced in
