January           when George W  Bush was inaugurated as the   rd president of the United States  and ended on January           Bush  a Republican  took office following a very close victory over

the eldest son of the   st president  George H  W  Bush  He was succeeded by Democrat Barack Obama  who won the      presidential election  Upon taking office  Bush pushed through a      trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act  a major education bill  He also pushed for socially conservative efforts  such as the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith based welfare initiatives  After the terrorist attacks on September           Bush created the United States Department of Homeland Security and declared a global war on terrorism  In October       Bush ordered an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban  destroy the terrorist group al Qaeda  and capture Osama bin Laden  That same month  he signed into law the controversial Patriot Act in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists  In       Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq  with administration officials arguing that the Saddam Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction  no WMD stockpiles were ever found  and had an operational relationship with al Qaeda  which conflicted with the consensus in the intelligence community   Later that year  he signed the Medicare Prescription

presidential campaign       Republican Party presidential primaries  and      Republican National Convention The oldest son of George H  W  Bush  the   st president of the United States  George W  Bush emerged as a presidential contender in his own right with his victory in the      Texas gubernatorial election  After winning re election by a decisive margin in the      Texas gubernatorial election  Bush became the widely acknowledged front runner in the race for the Republican nomination in the      presidential election  In the years preceding the      election  Bush established a stable of advisers  including supply side economics advocate Lawrence B  Lindsey and foreign policy expert Condoleezza Rice     With a financial team led by Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman  Bush built up a commanding financial advantage over other prospective Republican candidates     Though several prominent Republicans declined to challenge Bush  Arizona senator John McCain launched a spirited challenge that was supported by many moderates and foreign policy hawks  McCain s loss in the South Carolina primary effectively ended the      Republican primaries  and Bush was officially nominated for president at the      Republican National Convention  Bush selected former secretary of defense Dick Cheney as his running mate  though Cheney offered little electoral appeal and had health problems  Bush believed that Cheney s extensive experience would make him a valuable governing partner       Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore in the      presidential election  With President Bill Clinton term limited  the Democrats nominated Vice President Al Gore for president  Bush s campaign emphasized their own candidate s character in contrast with that of Clinton  who had been embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal  Bush held a substantial lead in several polls taken after the final debate in October  but the unearthing of Bush s      DUI arrest appeared to sap his campaign s momentum  By the end of election night  Florida emerged as the key state in the election  as whichever candidate won the state would win the presidency  Bush held an extremely narrow lead in the vote by the end of election night  triggering an automatic recount  The Florida Supreme Court ordered a partial manual recount  but the Supreme Court of the United States effectively ordered an end to this process  on equal protection grounds  in the case of Bush v  Gore  leaving Bush with a victory in both the state and the election  Though Gore narrowly won a plurality of the nationwide popular vote  Bush won the presidential election with     electoral votes compared to Gore s      In the concurrent congressional elections  Republicans retained a narrow majority in the House  but lost five seats in the Senate  leaving the partisan balance in the Senate at fifty Republicans and fifty Democrats      Administration edit  The Bush CabinetOfficeNameTermPresidentGeorge W  Bush         Vice PresidentDick Cheney

Portman         Susan Schwab          Rejecting the idea of a powerful White House chief of staff  Bush had high level officials report directly to him rather than Chief of Staff Andrew Card  Vice President Cheney emerged as the most powerful individual in the White House aside from Bush himself  Bush brought to the White House several individuals who had worked under him in Texas  including Senior Counselor Karen Hughes  Senior Adviser Karl Rove  legal counsel Alberto Gonzales  and Staff Secretary Harriet Miers     Other important White House staff appointees included Margaret Spellings as a domestic policy adviser  Michael Gerson as chief speechwriter  and Joshua Bolten and Joe Hagin as White House deputy chiefs of staff     Paul H  O Neill  who had served as deputy director of the OMB under Gerald Ford  was appointed secretary of the treasury  while former Missouri senator John Ashcroft was appointed attorney general     As Bush had little foreign policy experience  his appointments would serve an important role in dictating the foreign policy of the United States during his tenure  Several of his initial top foreign policy appointees had served in his father s administration  Vice President Cheney had been secretary of defense  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had served on the National Security Council  and deputy secretaries Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Armitage had also served in important roles  Secretary of State Colin Powell had served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the first president Bush     Bush had long admired Powell  and the former general was Bush s first choice for the position  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  who had served in the same position during the Ford administration  rounded out the key figures in the national security team     Rumsfeld and Cheney  who had served together in the Ford administration  emerged as the leading foreign policy figures during Bush s first term     O Neill  who opposed the Iraq War and feared that the Bush tax cuts would lead to deficits  was replaced by John W  Snow in February           Frustrated by the decisions of the Bush administration  particularly the launching of the Iraq War  Powell resigned following the      elections      He was replaced by Rice  while then deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley took Rice s former position      Most of Bush s top staffers stayed on after the      election  although Spellings joined the Cabinet as secretary of education and Gonzales replaced Ashcroft as attorney general      In early       Card left the White House in the wake of the Dubai Ports World controversy and several botched White House initiatives  and he was replaced by Joshua Bolten      Bolten stripped Rove of some of his responsibilities and convinced Henry Paulson  the head of Goldman Sachs  to replace Snow as secretary of the treasury      After the      elections  Rumsfeld was replaced by former CIA director Robert Gates      The personnel shake ups left Rice as one of the most prominent individuals in the administration  and she played a strong role in directing Bush s second term foreign policy      Gonzales and Rove both left in      after controversy regarding the dismissal of U S  attorneys  and Gonzales was replaced by Michael Mukasey  a former federal judge       Senior non cabinet officials and

nominations edit   Bush appointed John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States Further information  George W  Bush Supreme Court candidates  List of federal judges appointed by George W  Bush  and George W  Bush judicial appointment controversies After the      election  many expected that the aging Chief Justice William Rehnquist would step down from the United States Supreme Court  Cheney and White House Counsel Harriet Miers selected two widely respected conservatives  D C  Circuit Court of Appeals judge John Roberts and Fourth Circuit judge Michael Luttig  as the two finalists  In June       Justice Sandra Day O Connor unexpectedly announced that she would retire from the court  and Bush nominated Roberts for her position the following month  After Rehnquist died in September  Bush briefly considered elevating Associate Justice Antonin Scalia to the position of chief justice  but instead chose to nominate Roberts for the position  Roberts won confirmation from the Senate in a       vote  with all Republicans and a narrow majority of Democrats voting to confirm Roberts      To replace O Connor  the Bush administration wanted to find a female nominee  but was unsatisfied with the conventional options available      Bush settled on Miers  who had never served as a judge  but who had worked as a corporate lawyer and White House staffer      Her nomination immediately faced opposition from conservatives  and liberals  who were wary of her unproven ideology and lack of judicial experience  After Senate majority leader Bill Frist informed Bush that Miers did not have the votes necessary to win confirmation  Miers withdrew from consideration  Bush then nominated Samuel Alito  who received strong support from conservatives but faced opposition from Democrats  Alito won confirmation in a       vote in January               In the years immediately after Roberts and Alito took office  the Roberts Court was generally more conservative than the preceding Rehnquist Court  largely because Alito tended to be more conservative than O Connor had been      Bush also appointed    judges to the United States Courts of Appeals      judges to the United States district courts  and   judges to the United States Court of International Trade  Among them were two future Supreme Court associate justices  Neil Gorsuch to a seat on the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in       and Brett Kavanaugh to the Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit in        Domestic affairs edit  Main article  Domestic policy of the George W  Bush administration Bush tax

           Ref                     Bush s promise to cut taxes was the centerpiece of his      presidential campaign  and upon taking office  he made tax cuts his first major legislative priority  A budget surplus had developed during the Bill Clinton administration  and with the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan s support  Bush argued that the best use of the surplus was to lower taxes      By the time Bush took office  reduced economic growth had led to less robust federal budgetary projections  but Bush maintained that tax cuts were necessary to boost economic growth      After Treasury secretary Paul O Neill expressed concerns over the tax cut s size and the possibility of future deficits  Vice President Cheney took charge of writing the bill  which the administration proposed to Congress in March           Bush initially sought a      trillion tax cut over a ten year period  but ultimately settled for a       trillion tax cut      The administration rejected the idea of  triggers  that would phase out the tax reductions should the government again run deficits  The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of      won the support of congressional Republicans and a minority of congressional Democrats  and Bush signed it into law in June       The act lowered the top income tax rate from    percent to    percent  and it also reduced the estate tax  The narrow Republican majority in the Senate necessitated the use of the reconciliation  which in turn necessitated that the tax cuts would phase out in      barring further legislative action      After the tax bill was passed  Senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party and began caucusing with the Democrats  giving them control of the Senate  After Republicans re took control of the Senate during the      mid term elections  Bush proposed further tax cuts  With little support among Democrats  Congress passed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of       which cut taxes by another      billion over    years  That law also lowered the capital gains tax and taxes on dividends  Collectively  the Bush tax cuts reduced federal individual tax rates to their lowest level since World War II  and government revenue as a share of gross domestic product declined from       in      to       in           Most of the Bush tax cuts were later made permanent by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of       though that act rolled back the tax cuts on top earners      Contrary to the rhetoric of the Bush administration and Republicans  the tax cuts increased the budget deficit  Statements by President Bush  Vice President Dick Cheney  and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist that these tax cuts effectively  paid for themselves  were disputed by the CBPP      the U S  Treasury Department and the CBO                   Education edit   President George W  Bush prepares for the State of the Union Address  Aside from tax cuts  Bush s other major policy initiative upon taking office was education reform  Bush had a strong personal interest in reforming education  especially regarding the education of low income and minority groups  He often derided the  soft bigotry of low expectations  for allowing low income and minority groups to fall behind      Although many conservatives were reluctant to increase federal involvement in education  Bush s success in campaigning on education reform in the      election convinced many Republicans  including Congressman John Boehner of Ohio  to accept an education reform bill that increased federal funding      Seeking to craft a bipartisan bill  Bush courted Democratic senator Ted Kennedy  a leading liberal senator who served as the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Health  Education  and Pensions      Bush favored extensive testing to ensure that schools met uniform standards for skills such as reading and math  Bush hoped that testing would make schools more accountable for their performances and provide parents with more information in choosing which schools to send their children  Kennedy shared Bush s concern for the education of impoverished children  but he strongly opposed the president s proposed school vouchers  which would allow parents to use federal funding to pay for private schools  Both men cooperated to pass the No Child Left Behind Act  which dropped the concept of school vouchers but included Bush s idea of nationwide testing  Both houses of Congress registered overwhelming approval for the bill s final version  which Bush signed into law in January           However  Kennedy would later criticize the implementation of the act  arguing that Bush had promised greater federal funding for education       Surveillance and homeland security edit  Shortly after the September    attacks  Bush announced the creation of the Office of Homeland Security and appointed former governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge its director      After Congress passed the Homeland Security Act to create the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   Ridge became the first director of the newly created department  The department was charged with overseeing immigration  border control  customs  and the newly established Transportation Security Administration  TSA   which focused on airport security      Though the FBI and CIA remained independent agencies  the DHS was assigned jurisdiction over the Coast Guard  the Immigration and Naturalization Service  which was divided into three agencies   the United States Customs Service  which was also divided into separate agencies   and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  The Homeland Security Act represented the most significant departmental reorganization since the National Security Act of           On October           Bush signed into law the Patriot Act  Passed on the president s request  the act permitted increased sharing of intelligence among the U S  Intelligence Community and expanded the government s domestic authority to conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists      The Patriot Act also authorized the use of roving wiretaps on suspected terrorists and expanded the government s authority to conduct surveillance of suspected  lone wolf  terrorists      Bush also secretly authorized the National Security Agency to conduct warrantless surveillance of communications in and out of the United States       Campaign finance reform edit  McCain s      presidential campaign brought the issue of campaign finance reform to the fore of public consciousness in           McCain and Russ Feingold pushed a bipartisan campaign finance bill in the Senate  while Chris Shays  R CT  and Marty Meehan  D MA  led the effort of passing it in the House      In just the second successful use of the discharge petition since the     s  a mixture of Democrats and Republicans defied Speaker Dennis Hastert and passed a campaign finance reform bill      The House approved the bill with a         vote      while the bill passed the Senate in a       vote  the bare minimum required to overcome the filibuster      Throughout the congressional battle on the bill  Bush declined to take a strong position      However  in March       Bush signed into law the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act  stating that he thought the law would improve the financing system for elections but was  far from perfect       The law placed several limits on political donations and expenditures  and closed loopholes on contribution limits on donations to political candidates by banning the use of so called  soft money       Portions of the law restricting independent expenditures would later be struck down by the Supreme Court in the      case of Citizens United v  FEC       Healthcare edit  After the passage of the Bush tax cuts and the No Child Left Behind Act  Bush turned his domestic focus to healthcare  He sought to expand Medicare so it would also cover the cost of prescription drugs  a program that became known as Medicare Part D  Many congressional Democrats opposed the bill because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of drugs  while many conservative Republicans opposed the expansion of the government s involvement in healthcare  Assisted by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Senate majority leader Bill Frist  Bush overcame strong opposition and won passage of his Medicare bill      In December       Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act  the largest expansion of Medicare since the program s creation in            Attempted Social Security reform edit  See also  Social Security debate in the United States  President George W  Bush discussing Social Security in      After winning re election in       Bush made the partial privatization of Social Security his top domestic priority      He proposed restructuring the program so that citizens could invest some of the money they paid in payroll taxes  which fund the Social Security program      The president argued that Social Security faced an imminent funding crisis and that reform was necessary to ensure its continuing solvency      Bush expected a difficult congressional battle over his proposal  but  as he put it   I ve got political capital  and I intend to spend it       Groups like the AARP strongly opposed the plan  as did moderate Democrats like Max Baucus  who had supported the Bush tax cuts  Ultimately  Bush failed to win the backing of a single congressional Democrat for his plan  and even moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe and Lincoln Chafee refused to back privatization  In the face of unified opposition  Republicans abandoned Bush s Social Security proposal in mid            Response to Hurricane Katrina edit   New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin  Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco  President Bush and Louisiana Senator David Vitter meet September         in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  Hurricane Katrina  one of the largest and most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the United States  ravaged several states along the Gulf of Mexico in August       On a working vacation at his ranch in Texas  Bush initially allowed state and local authorities to respond to the natural disaster  The hurricane made landfall on August     devastating the city of New Orleans after the failure of that city s levees  Over eighteen hundred people died in the hurricane  and Bush was widely criticized for his slow response to the disaster      Stung by the public response  Bush removed Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael D  Brown from office and stated publicly that  Katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability at all levels of government       After Hurricane Katrina  Bush s approval rating fell below    percent  where it would remain for the rest of his tenure in office       Proposed immigration reform edit   President George W  Bush outlining his comprehensive immigration reform proposal in a television address  Although he concentrated on other domestic policies during his first term  Bush supported immigration reform throughout his administration  In May       he proposed a five point plan that would increase border security  establish a guest worker program  and create a path to citizenship for the twelve million illegal immigrants living in the United States  The Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of       which included many of the president s proposals  but the bill did not pass the House of Representatives  After Democrats took control of Congress in the      mid term elections  Bush worked with Ted Kennedy to re introduce the bill as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of       The bill received intense criticism from many conservatives  who had become more skeptical of immigration reform  and it failed to pass the Senate       Great Recession edit  See also  Financial crisis of           After years of financial deregulation accelerating under the Bush administration  banks lent subprime mortgages to more and more home buyers  causing a housing bubble  Many of these banks also invested in credit default swaps and derivatives that were essentially bets on the soundness of these loans  In response to declining housing prices and fears of an impending recession  the Bush administration arranged passage of the Economic Stimulus Act of       Falling home prices started threatening the financial viability of many institutions  leaving Bear Stearns  a prominent U S  based investment bank  on the brink of failure in March       Recognizing the growing threat of a financial crisis  Bush allowed Treasury secretary Paulson to arrange for another bank  JPMorgan Chase  to take over most Bear Stearn s assets  Out of concern that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might also fail  the Bush administration put both institutions into conservatorship  Shortly afterwards  the administration learned that Lehman Brothers was on the verge of bankruptcy  but the administration ultimately declined to intervene on behalf of Lehman Brothers      Paulson hoped that the financial industry had shored itself up after the failure of Bear Stearns and that the failure of Lehman Brothers would not strongly impact the economy  but news of the failure caused stock prices to tumble and froze credit  Fearing a total financial collapse  Paulson and the Federal Reserve took control of American International Group  AIG   another major financial institution that teetered on the brink of failure  Hoping to shore up the other banks  Bush and Paulson proposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of       which would create the      billion Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  to buy toxic assets  The House rejected TARP in a         vote  although support and opposition crossed party lines  only about one third of the Republican caucus supported the bill  After the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped     points on the day of the House vote  the House and Senate both passed TARP  Bush later extended TARP loans to U S  automobile companies  which faced their own crisis due to the weak economy  Though TARP helped end the financial crisis  it did not prevent the onset of the Great Recession  which would continue long after Bush left office           Social issues edit   Vice President Dick Cheney On his first day in office  President Bush reinstated the Mexico City policy  thereby blocking federal aid to foreign groups that offered assistance to women in obtaining abortions  Days later  he announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith based service organizations  despite the fears of critics that this would dissolve the traditional separation of church and state in the United States          To further this commitment  he created the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith based service organizations      In       Bush signed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act  which banned intact dilation and extraction  an abortion procedure      Early in his administration  President Bush became personally interested in the issue of stem cell research      The Clinton administration had issued guidelines allowing the federal funding of research utilizing stem cells  and Bush decided to study the situation s ethics before issuing his own executive order on the issue  Evangelical religious groups argued that the research was immoral as it destroyed human embryos  while various advocacy groups touted the potential scientific advances afforded by stem cell research      In August       Bush issued an executive order banning federal funding for research on new stem cell lines  the order allowed research on existing stem cell lines to continue      In July       Bush used his first presidential veto on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  which would have expanded federal funding of embryonic stem cell research  A similar bill was passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate early in mid      as part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s     Hour Plan  but was vetoed by Bush      After the Supreme Court struck down a state sodomy law in the      case of Lawrence v  Texas  conservatives began pushing for the Federal Marriage Amendment  which would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman  Bush endorsed this proposal and made it part of his campaign during the      and      election cycles          Bush was staunchly opposed to euthanasia and supported Attorney General John Ashcroft s ultimately unsuccessful suit against the Oregon Death with Dignity Act      However  while he was governor of Texas  Bush had signed a law giving hospitals the authority to remove life support from terminally ill patients against the wishes of spouses or parents  if the doctors deemed it as medically appropriate      This perceived inconsistency in policy became an issue in       when Bush signed controversial legislation to initiate federal intervention in the court battle of Terri Schiavo  a comatose Florida woman who ultimately died       Environmental policies edit  See also  Climate change policy of the George W  Bush administration  Cabinet meeting In March       the Bush administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol  an international treaty signed in      that required nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  The administration argued that ratifying the treaty would unduly restrict U S  growth while failing to adequately limit emissions from developing nations      Bush stated that he believed global warming is real     and a serious problem  although he asserted that there existed a  debate over whether it s man made or naturally caused       The Bush administration s stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities  Critics alleged that the administration     misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming      On January          President Bush designated the world s largest protected marine area  The Pacific Ocean habitat includes the Mariana Trench and the waters and corals surrounding three uninhabited islands in the Northern Mariana Islands  Rose Atoll in American Samoa  and seven islands along the equator       Other legislation edit  In July       following several accounting scandals such as the Enron scandal  Bush signed the Sarbanes Oxley Act into law  The act expanded reporting requirements for public companies     Shortly after the start of his second term  Bush signed the Class Action Fairness Act of       which had been a priority of his administration and part of his broader goal of instituting tort reform  The act was designed to remove most class action lawsuits from state courts to federal courts  which were regarded as less sympathetic to plaintiffs in class action suits       Foreign affairs edit  Main article  Foreign policy of the George W  Bush administration  President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas  President Bush  and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in June        Bush with Colombian President  Alvaro Uribe  Taking office edit  Upon taking office  Bush had little experience with foreign policy  and his decisions were guided by his advisers  Bush embraced the views of Cheney and other neoconservatives  who de emphasized the importance of multilateralism  neoconservatives believed that because the United States was the world s lone superpower  it could act unilaterally if necessary      At the same time  Bush sought to enact the less interventionist foreign policy he had promised during the      campaign      Though the first several months of his presidency focused on domestic issues  the Bush administration pulled the U S  out of several existing or proposed multilateral agreements  including the Kyoto Protocol

remarks from Ground Zero on September          Terrorism had emerged as an important national security issue in the Clinton administration  and it became one of the dominant issues of the Bush administration      In the late     s  Osama bin Laden had established al Qaeda  a militant Sunni Islamist multi national organization that sought to overthrow Western backed governments in Saudi Arabia  Jordan  Egypt  and Pakistan  In response to Saudi Arabia s decision to begin hosting U S  soldiers in       al Qaeda had begun a terrorist campaign against U S  targets  orchestrating attacks such as the      USS Cole bombing  During Bush s first months in office  U S  intelligence organizations intercepted communications indicating that al Qaeda was planning another attack on the United States  but foreign policy officials were unprepared for a major attack on the United States      Bush was briefed on al Qaeda s activities  but focused on other foreign policy issues during his first months in office      On September           al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and flew two them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City  destroying both     story skyscrapers  Another plane crashed into Pentagon  and a fourth plane was brought down in Pennsylvania following a struggle between the terrorists and the aircraft s passengers      The attacks had a profound effect on many Americans  who felt vulnerable to international attacks for the first time since the end of the Cold War      Appearing on national television on the night of the attacks  Bush promised to punish those who had aided the attacks  stating   we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them   In the following days  Bush urged the public to renounce hate crimes and discrimination against Muslim Americans and Arab Americans      He also declared a  War on Terror   instituting new domestic and foreign policies in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks       War in Afghanistan edit  Further information  War in Afghanistan       present   Bush with U S Ambassador to Afghanistan  Zalmay Khalilzad  As Bush s top foreign policy advisers were in agreement that merely launching strikes against al Qaeda bases would not stop future attacks  the administration decided to overthrow Afghanistan s conservative Taliban government  which harbored the leaders of al Qaeda      Powell took the lead in assembling allied nations in a coalition that would launch attacks on multiple fronts      The Bush administration focused especially on courting Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf  who agreed to join the coalition      On September     Congress passed a resolution called the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists  authorizing the president to use the military against those responsible for the attacks  On October         Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan      General Tommy Franks  the commander of the United States Central Command  CENTCOM   drew up a four phase invasion plan  In the first phase  the U S  built up forces in the surrounding area and inserted CIA and special forces operatives who linked up with the Northern Alliance  an Afghan resistance group opposed to the Taliban  The second phase consisted of a major air campaign against Taliban and al Qaeda targets  while the third phase involved the defeat of the remaining Taliban and al Qaeda forces  The fourth and final phase consisted of the stabilization of Afghanistan  which Franks projected would take three to five years  The war in Afghanistan began on October   with several air and missile strikes  and the Northern Alliance began its offensive on October     The capital of Kabul was captured on November     and Hamid Karzai was inaugurated as the new president of Afghanistan  However  the senior leadership of the Taliban and al Qaeda  including bin Laden  avoided capture  Karzai would remain in power for the duration of Bush s presidency  but his effective control was limited to the area around Kabul  as various warlords took control of much of the rest of the country      While the Karzai s government struggled to control the countryside  the Taliban regrouped in neighboring Pakistan  As Bush left office  he considered sending additional troops to bolster Afghanistan against the Taliban  but decided to leave the issue for the next administration       Bush Doctrine edit  After the September    attacks  Bush s approval ratings increased tremendously  Inspired in part by the Truman administration  Bush decided to use his newfound political capital to fundamentally change U S  foreign policy  He became increasingly focused on the possibility of a hostile country providing weapons of mass destruction  WMDs  to terrorist organizations      During his early      State of the Union Address  Bush set forth what has become known as the Bush Doctrine  which held that the United States would implement a policy of preemptive military strikes against nations known to be harboring or aiding a terrorist organization hostile to the United States       Bush outlined what he called the  Axis of Evil   consisting of three nations that  he argued  posed the greatest threat to world peace due to their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and potential to aid terrorists  The axis consisted of Iraq  North Korea and Iran       Bush also began emphasizing the importance of spreading democracy worldwide  stating in      that  the survival of liberty in our land depends on the success of liberty in other land   Pursuant to this newly interventionist policy  the Bush administration boosted foreign aid and increased defense expenditures       Defense spending rose from      billion in fiscal year      to      billion in fiscal year             Iraq edit  Prelude to the war edit  Further information  Rationale for the Iraq War and United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War  Map of the Middle East  including Iraq  During the presidency of George H  W  Bush  the United States had launched the Gulf War against Iraq after the latter invaded Kuwait  Though the U S  forced Iraq s withdrawal from Kuwait  it left Saddam Hussein s administration in place  partly to serve as a counterweight to Iran  After the war  the Project for the New American Century  consisting of influential neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz and Cheney  advocated for the overthrow of Hussein       Iraq had developed nuclear and chemical weapons prior to the Gulf War  after the war  it had submitted to WMD inspections conducted by the United Nations Special Commission until       when Hussein demanded that all UN inspectors leave Iraq       The administration believed that  by       Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction  and could possibly provide those weapons to terrorists       Some within the administration also believed that Iraq shared some responsibility for the September    attacks       and hoped that the fall of Hussein s regime would help spread democracy in the Middle East  deter the recruitment of terrorists  and increase the security of Israel     In the days following the September    attacks  hawks in the Bush administration such as Wolfowitz argued for immediate military action against Iraq  but the issue was temporarily set aside in favor of planning the invasion of Afghanistan       Beginning in September       the Bush administration mounted a campaign designed to win popular and congressional support for the invasion of Iraq       In October       Congress approved the Iraq Resolution  authorizing the use of force against Iraq  While congressional Republicans almost unanimously supported the measure  congressional Democrats were split in roughly equal numbers between support and opposition to the resolution       Bowing to domestic and foreign pressure  Bush sought to win the approval of the United Nations before launching an attack on Iraq       Led by Powell  the administration won the November      passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution       which called on Iraq to dismantle its WMD program       Meanwhile  senior administration officials became increasingly convinced that Iraq did indeed possess WMDs and was likely to furnish those WMDs to al Qaeda  CIA Director George Tenet assured Bush that it was a  slam dunk  that Iraq possessed a stockpile of WMDs       After a U N  weapons inspections team led by Hans Blix  as well as another team led by Mohamed ElBaradei  failed to find evidence of an ongoing Iraqi WMD program  Bush s proposed regime change in Iraq faced mounting international opposition  Germany  China  France  and Russia all expressed skepticism about the need for regime change  and the latter three countries each possessed veto power on the United Nations Security Council       At the behest of British prime minister Tony Blair  who supported Bush but hoped for more international cooperation  Bush dispatched Powell to the U N  to make the case to the Security Council that Iraq maintained an active WMD program       Though Powell s presentation preceded a shift in U S  public opinion towards support of the war  it failed to convince the French  Russians  or Germans       Contrary to the findings of Blix and ElBaradei  Bush asserted in a March    public address that there was  no doubt  that the Iraqi regime possessed weapons of mass destruction  Two days later  Bush authorized Operation Iraqi Freedom  and the Iraq War began on March                 Invasion of Iraq edit  Further information       invasion of Iraq U S  led coalition forces  led by General Franks  launched a simultaneous air and land attack on Iraq on March           in what the American media called  shock and awe   With         soldiers  the ground force quickly overcomes most Iraqi resistance  and thousands of Iraqi soldiers deserted  The U S  captured the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on April    but Hussein escaped and went into hiding  While the U S  and its allies quickly achieved military success  the invasion was strongly criticized by many countries  UN secretary general Kofi Annan argued that the invasion was a violation of international law and the U N  Charter       On May          Bush delivered the  Mission Accomplished speech   in which he declared the end of  major combat operations  in Iraq       Despite the failure to find evidence of an ongoing WMD program a  or an operational relationship between Hussein and al Qaeda  Bush declared that the toppling of Hussein  removed an ally of al Qaeda  and ended the threat that Iraq would supply weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations  Believing that only a minimal residual American force would be required after the success of the invasion  Bush and Franks planned for a drawdown to        U S  troops in Iraq by August       Meanwhile  Iraqis began looting their own capital  presenting one of the first of many challenges the U S  would face in keeping the peace in Iraq       Bush appointed Paul Bremer to lead the Coalition Provisional Authority  CPA   which was charged with overseeing the transition to self government in Iraq  In his first major order  Bremer announced a policy of de Ba athification  which denied government and military jobs to members of Hussein s Ba ath Party  This policy angered many of Iraq s Sunnis  many of whom had joined the Ba ath Party merely as a career move  Bremer s second major order disbanded the Iraqi military and police services  leaving over         Iraqi soldiers and government employees without jobs  Bremer also insisted that the CPA remain in control of Iraq until the country held elections  reversing an earlier plan to set up a transition government led by Iraqis  These decisions contributed to the beginning of the Iraqi insurgency opposed to the continuing U S  presence  Fearing the further deterioration of Iraq s security situation  General John Abizaid ordered the end of the planned drawdown of soldiers  leaving over         U S  soldiers in Iraq  The U S  captured Hussein in December       but the occupation force continued to suffer casualties  Between the start of the invasion and the end of           U S  soldiers died  with two thirds of those casualties occurring after Bush s  Mission Accomplished  speech

Iraqis began to see the U S  as an occupying force  The fierce fighting of the First Battle of Fallujah alienated many in Iraq  while cleric Muqtada al Sadr encouraged Shia Muslims to oppose the CPA       Sunni and Shia insurgents engaged in a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the United States  blunting the technological and organizational advantages of the U S  military       While fighting in Iraq continued  Americans increasingly came to disapprove of Bush s handling of the Iraq War  contributing to a decline in Bush s approval ratings       Bremer left Iraq in June       transferring power to the Iraqi Interim Government  which was led by Ayad Allawi       In January       the Iraqi people voted on representatives for the Iraqi National Assembly  and the Shia United Iraqi Alliance formed a governing coalition led by Ibrahim al Jaafari  In October       the Iraqis ratified a new constitution that created a decentralized governmental structure dividing Iraq into communities of Sunni Arabs  Shia Arabs  and Kurds  After a December      election  Jafari was succeeded as prime minister by another Shia  Nouri al Maliki  The elections failed to quell the insurgency  and hundreds of U S  soldiers stationed in Iraq died during      and       Sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias also intensified following the      al Askari mosque bombing       In a December      report  the bipartisan Iraq Study Group described the situation in Iraq as  grave and deteriorating   and the report called for the U S  to gradually withdraw soldiers from Iraq       As the violence mounted in       Rumsfeld and military leaders such as Abizaid and George Casey  the commander of the coalition forces in Iraq  called for a drawdown of forces in Iraq  but many within in the administration argued that the U S  should maintain its troop levels       Still intent on establishing a democratic government in Iraq  the Bush administration rejected a drawdown and began planning for a change in strategy and leadership following the      elections       After the elections  Bush replaced Rumsfeld with Gates  while David Petraeus replaced Casey and William J  Fallon replaced Abizaid       Bush and his National Security Council formed a plan to  double down  in Iraq  increasing the number of U S  soldiers in hopes of establishing a stable democracy       After Maliki indicated his support for an increase of U S  soldiers  Bush announced in January      that the U S  would send an additional        soldiers to Iraq as part of a  surge  of forces       Though Senator McCain and a few other hawks supported Bush s new strategy  many other members of Congress from both parties expressed doubt or outright opposition to it         President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki shake hands in July      In April       Congress  now controlled by Democrats  passed a bill that called for a total withdrawal of all U S  troops by April       but Bush vetoed the bill       Without the votes to override the veto  Congress passed a bill that continued to fund the war but also included the Fair Minimum Wage Act of       which increased the federal minimum wage       U S  and Iraqi casualties continuously declined after May       and Bush declared that the surge had been a success in September            He subsequently ordered a drawdown of troops  and the number of U S  soldiers in Iraq declined from         in September      to         when Bush left office       The decline in casualties following the surge coincided with several other favorable trends  including the Anbar Awakening and Muqtada al Sadr s decision to order his followers to cooperate with the Iraqi government       In       at the insistence of Maliki  Bush signed the U S  Iraq Status of Forces Agreement  which promised complete withdrawal of U S  troops by the end of            The U S  would withdraw its forces from Iraq in December            though it later re deployed soldiers to Iraq

U S  captured numerous members of al Qaeda and the Taliban  Rather than bringing the prisoners before domestic or international courts  Bush decided to set up a new system of military tribunals to try the prisoners  In order to avoid the restrictions of the United States Constitution  Bush held the prisoners at secret CIA prisons in various countries as well as at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp  Because the Guantanamo Bay camp is on territory that the U S  technically leases from Cuba  individuals within the camp are not accorded the same constitutional protections that they would have on U S  territory  Bush also decided that these  enemy combatants  were not entitled to all of the protections of the Geneva Conventions as they were not affiliated with sovereign states  In hopes of obtaining information from the prisoners  Bush allowed the use of  enhanced interrogation techniques  such as waterboarding       The treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib  a U S  prison in Iraq  elicited widespread outrage after photos of prisoner abuse were made public       In       Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act  which purported to ban torture  but in his signing statement Bush asserted that his executive power gave him the authority to waive the restrictions put in place by the bill       Bush s policies suffered a major rebuke from the Supreme Court in the      case of Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  in which the court rejected Bush s use of military commissions without congressional approval and held that all detainees were protected by the Geneva Conventions       Following the ruling  Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of       which effectively overturned Hamdan       The Supreme Court overturned a portion of that act in the      case of Boumediene v  Bush

administration placed the blame for the violence on the Palestinians  angering Arab states such as Saudi Arabia            However  Bush s support for a two state solution helped smooth over a potential diplomatic split with the Saudis       In hopes of establishing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians  the Bush administration proposed the road map for peace  but his plan was not

these attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president  the large scale mid term dismissal was without precedent  and Bush faced accusations that he had dismissed the attorneys for purely political reasons  During the      elections  several Republican officials complained that the U S  attorneys had not sufficiently investigated voter fraud  With the encouragement of Harriet Miers and Karl Rove  Attorney General Gonzales dismissed eight U S  attorneys who were considered insufficiently supportive of the administration s policies  Though Gonzales argued that the attorneys had been fired for performance reasons  publicly released documents showed that the attorneys were dismissed for political reasons  As a result of the dismissals and the subsequent congressional investigations  Rove and

strong wartime leader   though this was undermined by the increasingly unpopular Iraq War      His conservative policies on tax cuts and several other issues appealed to many on the right  but Bush could also lay claim to some centrist achievements  including No Child Left Behind  Sarbanes Oxley  and Medicare Part D       Fearing that he might hurt Bush s re election chances  Cheney offered to step down from the ticket  but Bush refused this offer  and the two were re nominated without opposition at the      Republican National Convention       On the advice of pollster Matthew Dowd  who
