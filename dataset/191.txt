to avoid competition  newspaper publishers persuaded the government to ban the BBC from broadcasting news before      pm  and to force it to use wire service copy instead of reporting on its own     The BBC gradually gained the right to edit the copy and  in       created its own news operation     However  it could not broadcast news before   PM until World War II     In addition to news  Gaumont British and Movietone cinema newsreels had been broadcast on the TV service since       with the BBC producing its own equivalent Television Newsreel programme from January           A weekly

counterpart  was still firmly under radio news  control in the     s  Correspondents provided reports for both outlets  and the first televised bulletin  shown on   July      on the then BBC

Robert Dougall  and Richard Baker three weeks before ITN s launch on    September           Mainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in          to larger premises

Newsreel Review of the Week  produced from       to open programming on Sunday evenings the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing  As this was the decade before electronic caption generation  each superimposition   super   had to be produced on paper or card  synchronised manually to studio and news footage  committed to tape during the afternoon  and broadcast early evening  Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace  The programme ran until the     s        by then using electronic captions  known as

Dougall presented the first week from studio N         described by The Guardian     as  a sort of polystyrene padded cell      the bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of       as a response to the ratings achieved by ITN s News at Ten  introduced three years earlier on the rival ITV  Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks  thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid     s  Angela Rippon became the first female news presenter of the Nine O Clock News in       Her work outside the news was controversial at the time  appearing on The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in      singing and dancing      The first edition of John Craven s Newsround  initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just Newsround  came from studio N  on   April       Afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late     s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself  rather than one of the three news studios  The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk  behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks  This period corresponded with when the Nine O Clock News got its next makeover  and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening  Also in the mid     s  the late night news on BBC  was briefly renamed Newsnight      but this was not to last  or be the same programme as we know today    that would be launched in         and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening BBC  news expanded to become Newsday  News on radio was to change in the     s  and on Radio   in particular  brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the Broadcasting in the Seventies  report  These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present  as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process  New programmes were also added to the daily schedule  PM and The World Tonight as part of the plan for the station to become a  wholly speech network       Newsbeat launched as the news service on Radio   on    September           On    September       a teletext system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched  Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers  but the system was expanded  The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on    October       it not only had subtitling for all channels  it also gave information such as weather  flight times and film reviews  By the end of the decade  the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining  with the introduction of ENG technology into the UK  The equipment would gradually become less cumbersome    the BBC s first attempts had been using a Philips colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable Sony U matic recorder in the latter half of the decade       s edit  By       ENG technology had become sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh to use an Ikegami camera to cover the Falklands War  coverage for which he won the  Royal Television Society Cameraman of the Year  award     and a BAFTA nomination       the first time that BBC News had relied upon an electronic camera  rather than film  in a conflict zone  BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage      however the event has become remembered in television terms for Brian Hanrahan s reporting where he coined the phrase  I m not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid  but I counted them all out and I counted them all back      to circumvent restrictions  and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure      Two years earlier  the Iranian Embassy Siege had been shot electronically by the BBC Television News Outside broadcasting team  and the work of reporter Kate Adie  broadcasting live from Prince s Gate  was nominated for BAFTA actuality coverage  but this time beaten by ITN for the      award      Newsnight  the news and current affairs programme  was due to go on air on    January       although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week      On    August      Moira Stuart became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television  The first BBC breakfast television programme  Breakfast Time also launched during the     s  on    January      from Lime Grove Studio E and two weeks before its ITV rival TV am  Frank Bough  Selina Scott  and Nick Ross helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting      The Six O Clock News first aired on   September       eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK  however  since      it has been overtaken by the BBC News at Ten   In October       images of millions of people starving to death in the Ethiopian famine were shown in Michael Buerk s Six O Clock News reports      The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine  with Buerk s report on    October describing it as  a biblical famine in the   th century  and  the closest thing to hell on Earth       The BBC News report shocked Britain  motivating its citizens to inundate relief agencies  such as Save the Children  with donations  and to bring global attention to the crisis in Ethiopia      The news report was also watched by Bob Geldof  who would organise the charity single  Do They Know It s Christmas   to raise money for famine relief followed by the Live Aid concert in July           Starting in       the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles a set of computer animated  stripes  forming a circle     on a red background with a  BBC News  typescript appearing below the circle graphics  and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards  The Nine used a similar  striped  number    The red background was replaced by a blue from      until       By       the BBC had decided to re brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music  the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the Nine  although the  stripes  introduction continued to be used until      on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule           s edit   The combined newsroom for domestic television and radio was opened at Television Centre in West London in       During the     s  a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News  with the split of BBC World Service Television to become BBC World  news and current affairs   and BBC Prime  light entertainment   Content for a    hour news channel was thus required  followed in      with the launch of domestic equivalent BBC News     Rather than set bulletins  ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary  In       after    years at Broadcasting House  the BBC Radio News operation moved to BBC Television Centre      New technology  provided by Silicon Graphics  came into use in      for a re launch of the main BBC   bulletins  creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically  The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring  titles  and music to differentiate each  A computer generated cut glass sculpture of the BBC coat of arms was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in       In       the biggest relaunch occurred  with BBC One bulletins  BBC World  BBC News     and BBC News Online all adopting a common style  One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the BBC regional news programmes  giving a common style across local  national and international BBC television news  This also included Newyddion  the main news programme of Welsh language channel S C  produced by BBC

Ten O Clock News  the ITN bulletin was moved to        where it remained until    January       The retirement of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the Ten O Clock News led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on    January       The Six O Clock News became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten  A new set design featuring a projected fictional newsroom backdrop was introduced  followed on    February      by new programme titles to match those of BBC News     BBC News    and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December       that was slightly altered on   July      to mark    years of BBC Television News      The individual positions of editor of the One and Six O Clock News were replaced by a new daytime position in November       Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News     replacing the position of editor  Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the Ten O Clock News  The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News     as a way of pooling resources  Bulletins received new titles and a new set design in May       to allow for Breakfast to move into the main studio for the first time since       The new set featured Barco videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for Breakfast  This was later replaced following viewer criticism      The studio bore similarities with the ITN produced ITV News in       though ITN uses a CSO Virtual studio rather than the actual screens at BBC News  Also  May saw the launch of World News Today the first domestic bulletin focused principally on international news  BBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November      as part of a restructuring of the BBC  The then Director of BBC News  Helen Boaden reported to the then Deputy Director General and head of the journalism group  Mark Byford until he was made redundant in           On    October       Mark Thompson announced a six year plan  Delivering Creative Future  merging the television current affairs department into a new  News Programmes  division          Thompson s announcement  in response to a    billion shortfall in funding  would  he said  deliver  a smaller but fitter BBC  in the digital age  by cutting its payroll and  in       selling Television Centre      The various separate newsrooms for television  radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom  Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department  BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost cutting at the BBC  In his blog  he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered  or by following more stories  there would be fewer ways to broadcast them      A new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January       This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins  editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on  The first new BBC News bulletin since the Six O Clock News was announced in July      following a successful trial in the Midlands      The summary  lasting    seconds  has been broadcast at       on weekdays since December      and bears similarities with    Seconds on BBC Three  but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary  As part of a long term cost cutting programme  bulletins were renamed the BBC News at One  Six and Ten respectively in April      while BBC News    was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre          BBC World was renamed BBC World News and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style  designed by Lambie Nairn      The studio moves also meant that Studio N   previously used for BBC World  was closed  and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News     Studio N  was later refitted to match the new branding  and was used for the BBC s UK local elections and European elections coverage in early

Main articles  BBC controversies and Criticism of the BBC Political and commercial independence edit  The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners  This political objectivity is sometimes questioned  For instance  The Daily Telegraph    August       carried a letter from the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky  referring to it as  The Red Service   Books have been written on the subject  including anti BBC works like Truth Betrayed by W J West and The Truth Twisters by Richard Deacon  The BBC s Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that whilst  the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged    the government of the day will often be the primary source of news       The BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and  by the opposition  of bias in favour of the government  Similarly  during times of war  the BBC is often accused by the UK government  or by strong supporters of British military campaigns  of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy  An edition of Newsnight at the start of the Falklands War in      was described as  almost treasonable  by John Page  MP  who objected to Peter Snow saying  if we believe the British       During the first Gulf War  critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name  Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation       During the Kosovo War  the BBC were labelled the  Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation   suggesting favouritism towards the FR Yugoslavia government over ethnic Albanian rebels  by British ministers      although Slobodan Milosevi   then FRY president  claimed that the BBC s coverage had been biased against his nation      Conversely  some of those who style themselves anti establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to  anti war  voices  Following the      invasion of Iraq  a study by the Cardiff University School of Journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of    references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them  and only one in    questioned this assumption  It also found that  out of the main British broadcasters covering the war  the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source  It was also the least likely to use independent sources  like the Red Cross  who were more critical of the war  When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties  the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels  The report s author  Justin Lewis  wrote  Far from revealing an anti war BBC  our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage  Either way  it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis       Prominent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias  The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist  as well as a friend of Tony Blair  The BBC s former Political Editor  Nick Robinson  was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and did  as a result  attract informal criticism from the former Labour government  but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of The Independent  a liberal leaning newspaper  before his appointment in       Mark Thompson  former Director General of the BBC  admitted the organisation has been biased  towards the left  in the past  He said   In the BBC I joined    years ago  there was  in much of current affairs  in terms of people s personal politics  which were quite vocal  a massive bias to the left       He then added   The organization did struggle then with impartiality  Now it is a completely different generation  There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC   Historian Mark Curtis finds that BBC news resembles a  straightforward state propaganda organ  that provides  critical support for the  British and Western  elite s promotion of foreign policy   such as the      war of aggression against Iraq   He says this militant nationalism is  not even subtle   and  citing Glasgow university  says BBC News is a chief example of  manufactured production of ideology       Since the aftermath of the EU referendum  some critics have charged that the BBC is biased in favour of leaving the EU   For instance  in       the BBC has received many complaints by Remainers who took issue at the BBC not sufficiently covering anti Brexit marches whilst giving smaller scale events hosted by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage more airtime       Such bias has also been expressed by the likes of Labour Peer Andrew Adonis who thought that the BBC  doesn t even realise it        On the other hand  a poll released by YouGov shows that     of leave voters think the BBC is  actively anti Brexit  compared to     of the same kinds of voters who think the BBC is pro Brexit       India edit  In       the BBC was criticised by some Indian outlets for referring to the terrorists who carried out the November      Mumbai attacks as  gunmen           The response to this added to prior criticism from some Indian commentators suggesting that the BBC may have an Indophobic bias       In March       the BBC was criticised for airing a documentary interviewing one of the rapists in India  In spite of a ban ordered by the Indian High court  the BBC still aired the documentary        Hutton Inquiry edit  Main article  Hutton Inquiry BBC News was at the centre of a political controversy following the      invasion of Iraq  Three BBC News reports  Andrew Gilligan s on Today  Gavin Hewitt s on The Ten O Clock News and another on Newsnight  quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government  particularly the Prime Minister s office  had embellished the September Dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq s weapons of mass destruction capabilities  The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism  In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report  saying that it had a reliable source  Following intense media speculation  David Kelly was named in the press as the source for Gilligan s story on   July       Kelly was found dead  by suicide  in a field close to his home early on    July  An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly s death  concluding that  Dr  Kelly took his own life        In his report on    January       Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan s original accusation was  unfounded  and the BBC s editorial and management processes were  defective   In particular  it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story  The BBC Director of News  Richard Sambrook  the report said  had accepted Gilligan s word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete  Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place  The Board of Governors  under the chairman s  Gavyn Davies  guidance  accepted that further investigation of the Government s complaints were unnecessary  Because of the criticism in the Hutton report  Davies resigned on the day of publication  BBC News faced an important test  reporting on itself with the publication of the report  but by common consent  of the Board of Governors  managed this  independently  impartially and honestly        Davies  resignation was followed by the resignation of Director General  Greg Dyke  the following day  and the resignation of Gilligan on    January  While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation  an ICM poll in April      indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news        Israeli Palestinian conflict edit  See also  Criticism of the BBC   Middle East and Israel  and Balen Report The BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti Israel and anti Palestine bias  Douglas Davis  the London correspondent of The Jerusalem Post  has described the BBC s coverage of the Arab Israeli conflict as  a relentless  one dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic  criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors  which  bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that  wittingly or not  has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half century         However two large independent studies  one conducted by Loughborough University and the other by Glasgow University s Media Group concluded that Israeli perspectives are given greater coverage            Critics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming  The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers  pounds from preventing the report being released to the public            Jeremy Bowen  the Middle East Editor for BBC world news  was singled out specifically for bias by the BBC Trust which concluded that he violated  BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality        An independent panel appointed by the BBC Trust was set up in      to review the impartiality of the BBC s coverage of the Israeli Palestinian conflict       The panel s assessment was that  apart from individual lapses  there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias   While noting a  commitment to be fair accurate and impartial  and praising much of the BBC s coverage the independent panel concluded  that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict  In some ways the picture is incomplete and  in that sense  misleading   It notes that   the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience   reflects  the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation   Writing in the Financial Times  Philip Stephens  one of the panellists  later accused the BBC s director general  Mark Thompson  of misrepresenting the panel s conclusions  He further opined  My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process  If I am right  the BBC  too  is lost        Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day       The description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of Yassir Arafat that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality  particularly from Martin Walker      in a guest opinion piece in The Times  who picked out the apparent case of Fayad Abu Shamala  the BBC Arabic Service correspondent  who told a Hamas rally on   May       that journalists in Gaza were  waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the Palestinian people        Walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons  Firstly  because the time period over which it was conducted  August      to January       surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon s stroke  which produced more positive coverage than usual  Furthermore  he wrote  the inquiry only looked at the BBC s domestic coverage  and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World       Tom Gross accused the BBC of glorifying Hamas suicide bombers  and condemned its policy of inviting guests such as Jenny Tonge and Tom Paulin who have compared Israeli soldiers to Nazis  Writing for the BBC  Paulin said Israeli soldiers should be  shot dead  like Hitler s S S  and said he could  understand how suicide bombers feel   citation needed  According to Gross  Paulin and Tonge continue to be invited as regular guests  and they are among the most frequent contributors to their most widely screened arts programme       The BBC also faced criticism for not airing a Disasters Emergency Committee aid appeal for Palestinians who suffered in Gaza during    day war there in late      early       Most other major UK broadcasters did air this appeal  but rival Sky News did not  citation needed  British journalist Julie Burchill has accused BBC of creating a  climate of fear  for British Jews over its  excessive coverage  of Israel compared to other nations        Partners edit  BBC and ABC share video segments and reporters as needed in producing their newscasts  with the BBC showing ABC World News Tonight with David Muir in the UK  However  in July       BBC announced a new partnership with CBS News allows both organisations to share video  editorial content  and additional newsgathering resources in New York  London  Washington and around the world       BBC News subscribes to wire services from leading international agencies including PA Media  formerly Press Association   Reuters  and Agence France Presse  In April       the BBC dropped Associated Press in favour of an enhanced service from AFP        The view of foreign governments edit  BBC News reporters and broadcasts are now and have in the past been banned in several countries primarily for reporting which has been unfavourable to the ruling government  For example  correspondents were banned by the former apartheid r gime of South Africa  The BBC was banned in Zimbabwe under Mugabe      for eight years as a terrorist organisation until being allowed to operate again over a year after the      elections       The BBC was banned in Burma  officially Myanmar   after their coverage and commentary on anti government protests there in September       The ban was lifted four years later in September       Other cases have included Uzbekistan       China       and Pakistan       The BBC online news site s Persian version was blocked from the Iranian internet in            The BBC News website was made available in China again in March            but as of October      update   was blocked again       In June       the Rwandan government placed an indefinite ban on BBC broadcasts following the airing of a controversial documentary regarding the      Rwandan genocide  Rwanda s Untold Story  broadcast on BBC  on   October       The UK s Foreign Office recognised  the hurt caused in Rwanda by some parts of the documentary        In February       reporters from the BBC  as well as the Daily Mail  The New York Times  Politico  CNN  and others  were denied access to a United States White House briefing        See also edit    BBC portal Journalism portal BBC newsreaders and journalists BBC television news programmes List of BBC newsreaders and reporters List of
