have also been used increasingly across NBC s output   Ratings edit  There is a fairly clear long term correlation between the performance of global stock markets and the audience ratings of CNBC  The network had a difficult time attracting viewers in the first half of the decade  but has seen viewership increase from a      bottom to record highs in       coinciding with the subprime mortgage crisis  CNBC continues to possess the wealthiest audience  in terms of average income  of any television channel in the United States      During the late     s and early     s  CNBC s ratings were increasing sharply along with the stock market  often beating those of CNN during market hours      In       daytime viewership of the network peaked at              around the time the Nasdaq Composite crossed       However  when the dot com bubble began to burst later that year  CNBC s viewing figures declined in tandem  The network s ratings steadily fell quarter after quarter  year after year  until bottoming in Q        with an average viewership of         during the day      From the bottom  the network  along with the markets  rebounded significantly   average daytime viewership       a m  to      p m   reached a   year high of         viewers in the first quarter of           Coinciding with the extreme market volatility of the ongoing global economic crisis  ratings hit an all time high of         in Q       Although the figures remain considerably less than those achieved by Fox News and CNN today  it has still had a      increase in viewership since the beginning of       Despite the viewership slump at the turn of the decade  CNBC has remained extremely profitable  average annual revenues top      million     while profits for the network exceeded      million in           making CNBC a cash cow for NBC Universal and its parent company  Comcast  CNBC is the second most profitable of NBC Universal s thirteen cable channels in the United States  behind only the USA Network      The network often sees large spikes in viewership on days of major market moves  During the week of February           when the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its seventh largest loss ever  CNBC s continuing coverage of events     resulted in its best ratings week since the market crash after the September          terrorist attacks  with Kudlow   Company  Mad Money  and Fast Money recording their best ratings ever in the coveted       demographic      When the financial crisis wreaked havoc in the worldwide equity markets  CNBC recorded some of the highest ratings in the network s two decade history  For the week ending September           the network averaged         viewers during the  business day   defined by the network as   a m  to   p m    During this week  Squawk Box  Closing Bell  Fast Money  Mad Money and Kudlow   Company recorded their best viewership figures ever      On September           when the markets faced their worst single session performance since the crash of       CNBC saw its best ratings day ever  with an average         viewers tuning into the network during the business day      While daytime viewership has rebounded from its      lows  primetime ratings remain weak relative to those of other news networks     and CNBC continues to try and rejuvenate its evening lineup  Along with developing new program formats such as Fast Money and Mad Money  the network operates a  checkerboard  programming approach  airing various genres of shows including documentaries  town hall style discussions and repeats of some NBC output      When discussing the network s ratings  CNBC management and press releases regularly suggest that considerable viewership  particularly during the daytime  is done  out of home  in places such as offices  restaurants  fitness centers  financial institutions  and hotel rooms          As this demographic is not covered by Nielsen ratings  CNBC claims that the network s true viewership is considerably higher than what is measured      On January          the Wall Street Journal reported that CNBC would be partnering with Cogent Research to calculate the viewership of its business day programming by surveying financial advisers and investors  This change will help to provide a more accurate measurement of the network s out of home viewership  Nielsen will still be used to track the viewership of its entertainment programming       On air presentation edit  This article may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience

coverage that the channel continues to carry  are replaced by CNBC World programming  However  documentaries are shown in Canada  This had the making of a major problem  as a highlight episode of The Apprentice   that aired April           was assumed to not be available anywhere for Canadians due to these blackouts  While the first airing at      p m  ET was blacked out  the second airing at midnight ET was accidentally shown  Blackouts on episodes that originally air on NBC and Global are likely to continue  However  occasionally  the television shows are shown and are not blacked out

main show appears on the left  This format was used from its launch on October          through October           The screenshot above was taken during Closing Bell on April          CNBC HD  formerly CNBC HD   is a     i high definition enhanced simulcast of CNBC  that was launched on October           The channel used a modified screen format during trading day programming  which shifted the existing     feed to the left of the screen to add a sidebar on the right side of the screen  which contained additional market statistics and a window showing video content from CNBC com  whose audio was carried on SAP until       when the service seemed to be discontinued  silent video promos for upcoming and primetime programming were aired in the window   and a wider version of the ticker  Primetime programming is shown in full screen      and usually produced in HD  On May           the right sidebar graphic was changed to show headlines  business news and otherwise   upcoming corporate earnings releases  upcoming economy data  easier to read charts  market statistics and stories coming up on the program being aired  On May          the CNBC HD ticker grew in size to match its standard definition counterpart  The five  flippers  on the top were dropped to four  with the fourth one  on the upper right hand corner of the screen  displaying the times of day in each global time zone  Eastern  Central  Pacific  London  Dubai  Singapore   On July           the right sidebar graphic was changed again  this time to show slightly larger displays  including charts   On October           CNBC HD was relaunched  due to the aforementioned network wide switch to a full screen      presentation  The sidebar graphic was permanently removed as well  having started with Mad Money on August   of the same year and before that  during commercial breaks   which in turn  led to all other live shows being presented in full screen      and therefore  eliminating the enhanced format altogether  DirecTV was the first provider to introduce CNBC HD  with various others eventually taking suit  all of the providers have the HD feed as of the October          redesign

criticized for allegedly amplifying bull and bear markets  particularly in the run up to the Dot com bubble and the subprime crisis          In response to these criticisms  CNBC anchors have pointed to the size of the market and noted that influencing it is  a little out of our reach       Jon Stewart on Comedy Central s The Daily Show has been a vocal critic of CNBC and some of its personalities  beginning after comments were made by Rick Santelli          Despite the lack of direct comments by the network  several personalities have defended their predictions and comments          CNBC was accused by the Obama administration of  cable chatter  the excessive and sometimes brutal discussion on a particular topic  often one sided            Jim Cramer s stock picks on his CNBC show Mad Money were found by Barron s magazine in      to have underperformed the S P     stock index over the previous two years  Barron s stated that  his picks haven t beaten the market  Over the past two years  viewers holding Cramer s stocks would be up     while the Dow rose     and the S P           CNBC disputed the magazine s findings       See also edit    Economy portal Television portal
