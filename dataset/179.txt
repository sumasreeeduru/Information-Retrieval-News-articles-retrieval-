presidential election was the   th quadrennial presidential election  held on Tuesday  November          The Democratic ticket of Barack Obama  the junior U S  Senator from Illinois  and Joe Biden  the senior U S  Senator from Delaware  defeated the Republican ticket of John McCain  the senior Senator from Arizona  and Sarah Palin  the Governor of Alaska  Obama became the first African American ever to be elected to the presidency  as well as being only the third sitting United States Senator elected president  joining Warren G  Harding and John F  Kennedy  Incumbent Republican President George W  Bush was ineligible to pursue a third term due to the term limits established by the   nd Amendment  McCain secured the Republican nomination by March       defeating former Governors Mitt Romney  Mike Huckabee  and other challengers  The Democratic primaries were marked by a sharp contest between Obama and the initial front runner  Senator Hillary Clinton  Clinton s victory in the New Hampshire primary made her the first woman to win a major party s presidential primary  nb    After a long primary season  Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June       Early campaigning focused heavily on the Iraq War and Bush s unpopularity  McCain supported the war  as well as a troop surge that had begun in       while Obama strongly opposed the war  Bush endorsed McCain  but the two did not campaign together  and Bush did not appear in person at the      Republican National Convention  Obama campaigned on the theme that  Washington must change   while McCain emphasized his experience  The campaign was strongly affected by the onset of a major financial crisis  which peaked in September       McCain s decision to suspend his campaign during the height of the financial crisis backfired as voters viewed his response as erratic     Obama won a decisive victory over McCain  winning the Electoral College and the popular vote by a sizable margin  including states that had not voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since       North Carolina  and       Indiana and Virginia   Obama received the largest share of the popular vote won by a Democrat since Lyndon B  Johnson in      and was the first Democrat to win an outright majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in       Obama s total count of      million votes stood as the largest tally ever won by a presidential candidate until       when this was surpassed by both major party candidates in a high turnout election  Obama flipped nine states that had voted Republican in       Colorado  Florida  Indiana  Iowa  Nevada  New Mexico  North Carolina  Ohio  and Virginia  as well as Nebraska s  nd congressional district   Contents    Background   Nominations      Democratic Party nomination

election   Procedure  The incumbent in       George W  Bush  His second term expired at noon on January           Article Two of the United States Constitution provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be natural born citizens of the United States  at least    years old  and residents of the United States for a period of at least    years  Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties  in which case each party devises a method  such as a primary election  to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position  Traditionally  the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate  The party s delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party s behalf  The general election in November is also an indirect election  where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College  these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president  President George W  Bush  a Republican and former Governor of Texas  was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the Twenty second Amendment  in accordance with Section   of the Twentieth Amendment  his term expired at noon eastern standard time on January           Also ineligible to run for an additional term as president was past two term president Bill Clinton  While neither of them ran  former presidents Jimmy Carter and George H  W  Bush  each having served only one term  were both eligible to run for a second term as president   Nominations Democratic Party nomination Main articles  Barack Obama      presidential campaign       Democratic Party presidential primaries  and      Democratic National

the results of the      presidential election were released  In the      midterm elections  the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of the U S  Congress     Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates     Nevertheless  the media speculated on several other candidates  including Al Gore  the runner up in the      election  John Kerry  the runner up in the      election  John Edwards  Kerry s running mate in       Senator from Delaware Joe Biden  New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson  Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack  and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh     Edwards was one of the first to formally announce his candidacy for the presidency  on December           This run would be his second attempt at the presidency     Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January              Obama announced his candidacy on February    in his home state of Illinois      Early primaries and caucuses Early in the year  the support for Barack Obama started to increase in the polls and he passed Clinton for the top spot in Iowa  he ended up winning the caucus in that state  with John Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third      Obama s win was fueled mostly by first time caucus goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the  candidate of change       Iowa has since been viewed as the state that jump started Obama s campaign and set him on track to win both the nomination and the presidency      After the Iowa caucus  Joe Biden and Christopher Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest      Obama became the new front runner in New Hampshire  when his poll numbers skyrocketed after his Iowa victory     The Clinton campaign was struggling after a huge loss in Iowa and no strategy beyond the early primaries and caucuses  According to The Vancouver Sun  campaign strategists had  mapped a victory scenario that envisioned the former first lady wrapping up the Democratic presidential nomination by Super Tuesday on Feb          In what is considered a turning point for her campaign  Clinton had a strong performance at the Saint Anselm College  ABC  and Facebook debates several days before the New Hampshire primary as well as an emotional interview in a public broadcast live on TV      Clinton won that primary by    of the vote  contrary to the predictions of pollsters who consistently had her trailing Obama for a few days up to the primary date       Clinton s win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party s presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection      On January           after placing in third in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries  Edwards announced that he was suspending his campaign for the presidency  but he did not initially endorse any remaining candidates           Super Tuesday   Super Tuesday was February          when the largest ever number of simultaneous state primary elections was held      Super Tuesday ended up leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie  with Obama amassing     delegates to Clinton s     from the    states that held Democratic primaries      California was one of the Super Tuesday states that could provide a large number of delegates to the candidates  Obama trailed in the California polling by an average of      before the primary  he ended up losing that state by      of the vote      Some analysts cited a large Latino turnout that voted for Clinton as the deciding factor      The Louisiana  Nebraska  Hawaii  Wisconsin  U S  Virgin Islands  the District of Columbia  Maryland  and Virginia primaries and the Washington and Maine caucuses all took place after Super Tuesday in February  Obama won all of them  giving him    consecutive victories after Super Tuesday           Ohio  Texas  and Pennsylvania On March    Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries  some considered these wins  especially Ohio  a  surprise upset  by              although she did lead in the polling averages in both states          She also carried the primary in Texas  but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton      Only one state held a primary in April  This was Pennsylvania  on April     Although Obama made a strong effort to win Pennsylvania  Hillary Clinton won that primary by nearly      with approximately     of the vote      Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania  but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small town Americans  cling  to guns and religion drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State      In addition  Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania  Throughout the primary process  she relied on the support of older  white  working class voters  Pennsylvania held a closed primary  which means that only registered Democrats could vote  and  according to Ron Elving of NPR  the established Democratic electorate  was older  whiter  more Catholic and more working class than in most of the primaries to date       After Pennsylvania  Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination  Clinton  however  had received the endorsement of more superdelegates than Obama       Indiana and North Carolina On May    North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries  Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place  Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana          In the actual results  Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states  winning by a significant margin in North Carolina     and losing by only      in Indiana         to              After these primaries  most pundits declared that it had become  increasingly improbable   if not impossible  for Clinton to win the nomination      The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month      Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates  it was not enough to overcome Obama s substantial delegate lead   Florida and Michigan During late       the two parties adopted rules against states  moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year  For the Republicans  the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party s delegates to the convention  The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules  The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February           Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states  though     voted uncommitted in Michigan  and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates      There was some speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August  On May           the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party reached a compromise on the Florida and Michigan delegate situation  The committee decided to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the convention in August  but to only award each a half vote       Clinching the nomination       DNC during Stevie Wonder s performance The major political party nomination process  technically  continues through June of an election year  In previous cycles  the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the primaries held in March  but  in this cycle  however  Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June    after a    month campaign against Hillary Clinton  He had a wide lead in states won  while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states  Now  because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests  numbers were close between Clinton and Obama      By May  Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote  but the Associated Press found that her numbers were  accurate only  in one close scenario      In June  after the last of the primaries had taken place  Obama secured the Democratic nomination for president  with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements  most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed       He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States      For several days  Clinton refused to concede the race  although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post primary speech on June   in her home state of New York      She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June    She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she could to help him get elected       Republican Party nomination Main articles  John McCain      presidential campaign       Republican Party presidential primaries  and

but it was also the first time since the      election that neither sought his party s nomination for president  as Bush was term limited from seeking another nomination  the unique aspect was Vice President Cheney s decision not to seek the Republican nomination          The      election was also the third presidential election since      in which neither the incumbent president  the incumbent

speculating  as they did about the Democrats  about potential Republican candidates for president in          In November       former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls  followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain      The media speculated that Giuliani s pro choice stance on abortion and McCain s age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies     Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of       with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place      Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee  Giuliani  Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney  and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January     February    February     and March     respectively                  McCain officially announced his candidacy on March          after several informal announcements      In the third quarter of       the top four GOP  Republican  fundraisers were Romney  Giuliani  Thompson  and Ron Paul      MSNBC s Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early            Early primaries caucuses Huckabee  winner of Iowa  had little to no money and hoped for at least a third place finish in New Hampshire  McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire  McCain staged a turnaround victory      having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race      With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates for moving their primaries into January      against party rules  the race for the nomination was based there  McCain meanwhile managed a small victory over Huckabee in South Carolina      setting him up for a larger and more important victory over Romney in Florida  which held a closed primary on January         By this time  after several scandals  no success in the early primaries  and a third place finish in Florida  Giuliani conceded from the nomination race and endorsed John McCain the next day       Super Tuesday McCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday  This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state s primary      which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states  On Super Tuesday  McCain won his home state of Arizona  taking all    delegates  He also won nearly all of California s     delegates  the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes  McCain also scored wins in seven other states  picking up     delegates      Huckabee was the  surprise performer   winning   states and     delegates      Romney won   states and     delegates      Two days later  Romney suspended his presidential campaign  saying that if he stayed in the race  he would  forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win       His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain s only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses  Romney endorsed McCain on February         Louisiana  the District of Columbia  Kansas  Wisconsin  and Washington held primaries in February after Super Tuesday  Despite McCain picking up big victories  Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas  McCain narrowly carried the Washington caucuses over Huckabee and Paul  who amassed a large showing      The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans  After Super Tuesday  John McCain had become the clear front runner  but by the end of February  he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination  In March  John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries  Texas  Ohio  Vermont  and Rhode Island  putting him over the top of the       delegates required to win the GOP nomination      Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain  leaving Ron Paul  who had just    delegates  as his only remaining opponent      Romney would eventually become the Republican presidential nominee   years later  which he then lost to Barack Obama   Third party and other nominations Main article  Third party and independent candidates for the      United States presidential election Along with the Democratic and Republican parties  three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum     electoral votes needed to win the election  These were the Constitution Party  the Green Party  and the Libertarian Party  In addition  independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign  The Constitution Party nominated writer  pastor  and conservative talk show host Chuck Baldwin for president  and attorney Darrell Castle from Tennessee for Vice President          While campaigning  Baldwin voiced his opposition to the Iraq War  the Sixteenth Amendment  Roe v  Wade  the IRS  and the Federal Reserve      The Green Party nominated former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney from Georgia for President  and political activist Rosa Clemente from New York for Vice President  McKinney campaigned on a platform that supported single payer universal health care  the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan  reparations for African Americans  and the creation of a Department of Peace      The Libertarian Party nominated former Republican Representative Bob Barr from Georgia for President  and his former rival for the Libertarian nomination Wayne Allyn Root from Nevada  for vice president  During the      presidential campaign  Barr advocated a reworking or abolition of the income tax     and opposed the war in Iraq     and the Patriot

Republican National Convention  held in Saint Paul  Minnesota  General election campaign Issues Iraq The unpopular war in Iraq was a key issue during the campaign before the economic crisis  John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it  Obama s early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries  as well as stand out to a war weary electorate during the general campaign   Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II      his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next    to     years would prove costly  Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush  John McCain s support for the troop  surge  employed by General David Petraeus  which was one of several factors credited with improving the security situation in Iraq  may have boosted McCain s stance on the issue in voters  minds  McCain  who supported the invasion  argued that his support for the successful surge showed his superior judgment  However  Obama was quick to remind voters that there would have been no need for a  surge  had there been no war at all  thus questioning McCain s judgment   Bush s unpopularity George W  Bush had become increasingly unpopular among Americans by late      due in part by the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War domestically and internationally  as well as Bush s handling of the financial crisis of          By the time Obama was elected as President of the United States on November         Bush s approval rating was in the low to mid   s and his disapproval grew increasingly significant  being in the high   s  and even low   s in some polls  citation needed  Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around    percent              In March       Bush endorsed McCain at the White House      but did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign  Bush appeared at the      GOP convention only through a live video broadcast  He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav  Although he supported the war in Iraq  McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change  During the entire general election campaign  Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush     of the time  and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office       Age issue This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article

to Senator Bob Dole s      presidential campaign  one of the more widely leveled charges against McCain was the issue of his age he turned    in August and there was widespread concern about the idea of electing a man who would be    years old if he completed two full terms in office  the oldest president  Ronald Reagan  had been a month shy of    when he left office in January        In addition  McCain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in North Vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head  His age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful Senator Obama  who was the first Generation Xer to run for president on a major party ticket  McCain for comparison was born before World War II and belonged to the generation preceding the baby boomers  Much like Bob Dole  McCain attempted to counter these charges by releasing all of his medical records  something Obama did not do  McCain s wife Cindy dismissed concerns about his health by arguing that  We went hiking the Grand Canyon last summer and  John  did great and had no trouble keeping up with us   McCain also appeared at several campaign stops with his still active    year old mother  In a speech on the House floor  Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha criticized McCain s age by saying  Seven presidents have come and gone since I ve been in Congress  and I saw the toll the job took on each one of them   If elected  McCain would have been the first  and only  President born in the decade of the     s  McCain ultimately died in       just one year after the completion of Obama s second term  Like the Clinton campaign in       Obama avoided discussing McCain s age directly  instead preferring to simply call his ideas and message  old  and  old hat   He also made a strong appeal to youth voters and back during his primary contest with Hillary Clinton  had stated  When I watched the feud between the Clintons and  Newt Gingrich  unfold during the     s  I was reminded of old quarrels started on college campuses long ago  It s time for a new generation to take over   Obama s active use of a Blackberry and other modern technology also stood in contrast to the Arizona Senator s admission that he did not use a computer or a cell phone  McCain s service in Vietnam  while marketable to baby boomers  was referred to as  unimportant  to younger voters    Obama campaigning as a symbol of change in Cleveland  Ohio with a  Change We Need  sign Obama promised  universal health care  full employment  a green America  and an America respected instead of feared by its enemies       Polls regularly found the general electorate as a whole divided more evenly between  change  and  experience  as candidate qualities than the Democratic primary electorate  which split in favor of  change  by a nearly     margin      Advantages for McCain and Obama on experience and the ability to bring change  respectively  remained steady through the November   election  However  final pre election polling found that voters considered Obama s inexperience less of an impediment than McCain s association with sitting President George W  Bush      an association which was rhetorically framed by the Obama campaign throughout the election season as  more of the same   McCain appeared to undercut his line of attack by picking first term Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate      Palin had been governor only since       and before that had been a council member and mayor of Wasilla  The choice of Palin was controversial  however  it appeared to solve two pressing concerns McCain s age and health  since a youthful vice president would succeed him to office if he died or became incapacitated  and appealing to right wing conservatives  a group that had been comparatively unmoved by McCain  Palin also came off as more down to earth and relatable to average Americans than McCain  widely criticized as a  Beltway insider       However  media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues  and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be vice president or President  In this regard  her inexperience was also a liability when McCain s age and health were factored in there was a higher than normal probability of Palin succeeding to the presidency and many moderates and independents chafed at this idea   One    year old heartbeat away from the presidency  became a popular anti GOP slogan  Late night TV host David Letterman jokingly referred to Palin as resembling  a slutty flight attendant  and even Obama himself on a September   speech referred to the Alaska governor s policies as  the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig   She also came under attack on everything from her    year old daughter giving birth to a child out of wedlock to actively participating in hunting moose and other animals      Because of Palin s conservative views  there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates  two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election       Economy Polls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters          In the fall of       many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression      During this period  John McCain s election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy  On August     John McCain said in an interview with Politico that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife  Cindy  owned   I think I ll have my staff get to you   he told the media outlet      Both on the stump and in Obama s political ad   Seven   the gaffe was used to portray McCain as somebody unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans  This out of touch image was further cultivated when  on September     the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy  at a morning rally in Jacksonville  Florida  McCain declared that  the fundamentals of our economy are strong   despite what he described as  tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street       With the perception among voters to the contrary  the comment appeared to cost McCain politically  On September           after the onset of the      global financial crisis  McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington so he could help craft a      billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry  and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill      Despite this decision  McCain was portrayed as somebody not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill  which fell short of passage in the House  He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September     despite Congress  lack of immediate action on the bill  His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy  Days later  a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate  with Obama  his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden  and McCain all voting for the measure  Hillary Clinton would as well       All the aforementioned remarks and campaign issues hurt McCain s standing with voters  All these also occurred after the onset of the economic crisis and after McCain s poll numbers had started to fall  Although sound bites of all of these  missteps  were played repeatedly on national television  many pundits and analysts say that the actual financial crisis and economic conditions caused McCain s large drop in support in mid September and severely damaged his campaign           Health care John McCain s proposals focused on open market competition rather than government funding or control  At the heart of his plan were tax credits          for individuals and        for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer  To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre existing conditions  McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a  Guaranteed Access Plan       Barack Obama called for universal health care  His health care plan proposed creating a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare like government run option  Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status  and premiums would not vary based on health status either  It would have required parents to cover their children  but did not require adults to buy insurance  Critics of McCain s plan argued that it would not significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans  would increase costs  reduce consumer protections and lead to less generous benefit packages       Critics of Obama s plan argued that it would increase federal regulation of private health insurance without addressing the underlying incentives behind rising health care spending          Mark Pauly suggested that a combination of the two approaches would work better than either one alone       A poll released in early November      found that voters supporting Obama listed health care as their second priority  voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth  tied with the war in Iraq  Affordability was the primary health care priority among both sets of voters   Obama voters were more likely than McCain voters to believe government can do much about health care costs        Presidential debates Main article       United States

Campaign costs Main article  Fundraising for the      United States presidential election The reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years  One source

more than doubled in only eight years         million in              million in       and       billion in             In January       Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E  Toner estimated

American supporters on Facebook and         followers on Twitter  while McCain attracted only         Facebook supporters  likes  and       followers on Twitter  Obama s YouTube channel held         subscribers and more than    million video views  Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary       Obama s edge in social media was crucial to the election outcome  According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life project     percent of Americans relied on online video for election news  Ten percent of Americans used social networking sites to learn about the election        The      election showed huge increases in Internet use  Another study done after the election gave a lot of insight on young voters  Thirty seven percent of Americans ages       got election news from social networking sites  Almost a quarter of Americans saw something about the election in an online video        YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before  The Republican Party in particular was criticized for not adequately using social media and other means to reach young voters  Anonymous and semi anonymous smear campaigns  traditionally done with fliers and push calling  also spread to the Internet       Organizations specializing in the production and distribution of viral material  such as Brave New Films  emerged  such organizations have been said to be having a growing influence on American politics        Controversies Voter suppression Allegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states  Colorado  Indiana  Ohio  Michigan  Nevada and North Carolina       On October         the Republican Lt  Governor of Montana  John Bohlinger  accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge       voters from three counties which trend Democratic       Allegations arose in Michigan that the Republican Party planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes       The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this  The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation       Libertarian candidate Bob Barr filed a lawsuit in Texas to have Obama and McCain removed from the ballot in that state       His campaign alleged that both the candidates had missed the August    deadline to file  and were present on the ballot contrary to Texas election law  Neither Obama  or McCain at the time of the deadline had been confirmed as the candidate for their respective parties  The Texas Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without explanation       In Ohio  identified by both parties as a key state  allegations surfaced from both Republicans and Democrats that individuals from out of state were moving to the state temporarily and attempting to vote despite not meeting the state s requirement of

survey  conducted after the election  found that     of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama  versus     who viewed the coverage as unfair  Regarding McCain      of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus     who characterized it as unfair  Among affiliated Democrats      believed the press fairly covered Obama  just     of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain       At the February debate  Tim Russert of NBC News was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton       Among the questions  Russert had asked Clinton  but not Obama  to provide the name of the new Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev        This was later parodied on Saturday Night Live  In October       liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers  licenses for illegal immigrants       On April     ABC News hosted a debate in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos were criticized by viewers  bloggers and media critics for the poor quality of their questions            Many viewers said they considered some of the questions irrelevant when measured against the importance of the faltering economy or the Iraq War  Included in that category were continued questions about Obama s former pastor  Senator Hillary Clinton s assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago  and Senator Obama s not wearing an American flag pin       The moderators focused on campaign gaffes and some believed they focused too much on Obama       Stephanopoulos defended their performance  saying  Senator Obama was the front runner  and the questions were  not inappropriate or irrelevant at all             In an op ed published on April          in The New York Times  Elizabeth Edwards wrote that the media covered much more of  the rancor of the campaign  and  amount of money spent  than  the candidates  priorities  policies and principles        Author Erica Jong commented that  our press has become a sea of triviality  meanness and irrelevant chatter        A Gallup poll released on May          also estimated that more Americans felt the media was being harder on Hillary Clinton than they were towards Barack Obama  Time magazine columnist Mark Halperin stated that the media during the      election had a  blind  almost slavish  worship of Obama       The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press  Politics and Public

Clinton received      compared to only     favorable media coverage of McCain       Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage of Obama to be     negative from June   to July    compared to     negative for McCain       An October    study found     of stories about Obama to be negative  compared to     of stories about McCain

became improbable as Obama amassed early wins in his home state of Illinois  the Northeast  and the critical battleground states of Ohio  which no Republican has ever been elected president without winning  and Pennsylvania by      PM Eastern Standard Time       Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan  Wisconsin  and Minnesota by double digits  McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota  South Dakota  Nebraska  though notably  Obama did win an electoral vote from Nebraska s  nd congressional district   Kansas  Oklahoma  Montana  Utah  Idaho  Wyoming  and his home state of Arizona  McCain  unlike Bush in      and       failed to win all the southern states  Obama won Florida  North Carolina  and Virginia

world in London  Bonn  Berlin  Obama  Japan  Toronto  Rio de Janeiro  Sydney  and Nairobi       Later on election night  after Obama was named the winner  he picked up several more wins in swing states in which the polls had shown a close race  These included Florida  Indiana  Virginia  and the western states of Colorado and Nevada  All of these states had been carried by Bush in       North Carolina and the bellwether state of Missouri remained undecided for several days  Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri  with Obama pulling out a rare win in Nebraska s  nd congressional district  This put the projected electoral vote count at     for Obama and     for McCain  Obama s victories in the populous swing states of Florida  Ohio  Pennsylvania

number of votes were cast       The final tally of total votes counted was       million  compared to       million in       which also boasted the highest record since       the last presidential election before the voting age was lowered to      Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters        million votes could reflect a turnout as high as       of eligible voters  which would be the highest since                 This       turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of                   Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at

November          two days after the election  which concluded that the anticipated increase in turnout had failed to materialize       That report was the basis for some news articles that indicated voter turnout failed to meet expectations            When the remaining votes were counted after the release of the report  the total number of votes cast in the presidential election was raised to       million  which surpassed the American University report s preliminary estimate of       to       million voters by a factor of between    and     The election saw increased participation from

  Analysis Obama  having a white mother and Kenyan father of the Luo ethnic group       became the first African American as well as the first bi racial president       Although he may have been the first black president to win an election  Obama was not the first African American to run for president  Shirley Chisolm  Jesse Jackson  Lenora Fulani  Carol Moseley Braun  Alan Keyes  and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination       The Obama Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo Saxon Protestant  Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected vice president  all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated                          Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since       John F  Kennedy Lyndon B  Johnson   in the previous election cycle        Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators  John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina  but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney   Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy  and the Obama Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since       Franklin D  Roosevelt Henry A  Wallace   Also  Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in       the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in       and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in       This was the first presidential election since      in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent president or Vice President    Swing by state  States are listed by  increasing  percentage of Democratic votes  showing how the share of the vote changed between      and       Excluding the candidates  home states  only five states trended more Republican  Arkansas  Louisiana  Oklahoma  Tennessee and West Virginia  Prior to the election  commentators discussed whether Senator Obama would be able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades       In many ways  he was successful  He won every region of the country by double digits except the South  which John McCain won by nine percent  Obama won Delaware  the District of Columbia  Maryland  North Carolina  Florida  and Virginia in the South  region as defined by the US Census Bureau   McCain won most of the Deep South  where white voters had generally supported Republican candidates by increasingly large margins in the previous few decades       Obama also defied political bellwethers  becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since       as well as the first Democrat ever to do so  and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since       He was the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in      and the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning West Virginia since       Because one West Virginia elector voted for the Democrat in       Obama was the first Democrat to win without any electors from the state since its founding in       Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee for the first time since       Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana  which were won by Bill Clinton in        he nonetheless was competitive in both  He lost Montana by just under    and Georgia by slightly more than     Also notably  Barack Obama won all of the      swing states  states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than     by a margin of     percent or more except for Ohio  which the Democrat carried by     percent  Obama was the first presidential candidate to split the electoral votes from Nebraska  Together with Maine  which would not split its votes until       Nebraska is one of two states that split their electoral votes  two going to the statewide popular vote winner and the rest going to the winner of each respective congressional district  Nebraska has three  and Maine has two   Obama won the electoral vote from Nebraska s  nd congressional district  which contains the city of Omaha  Nebraska s other four electoral votes went to John McCain  As of      update   this election is the last time that Indiana and North Carolina voted Democratic  and is also the most recent election where one of the nominees has since died  This election exhibited the continuation of some of the polarization trends evident in the      and      elections       McCain won whites       percent  while Obama won blacks      percent       Hispanics       percent  and Asians       percent  Voters aged       voted for Obama by       percent while elderly voters backed McCain       percent       The    year age gap between McCain and Obama was the widest in U S  presidential election history among the top two candidates        See also Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy
