country in the Levant region of Western Asia  on the East Bank of the Jordan River  Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia  Iraq  Syria  Israel and Palestine  West Bank   The Dead Sea is located along its western borders and the country has a    kilometre     mi  coastline on the Red Sea in its extreme south west     Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia  Africa and Europe     The capital  Amman  is Jordan s most populous city as well as the country s economic  political and cultural centre      What is now Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period  Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age  Ammon  Moab and Edom  Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom  the Roman Empire  and the Ottoman Empire  After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in      during World War I  the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France  The Emirate of Transjordan was established in      by the Hashemite  then Emir  Abdullah I  and the emirate became a British protectorate  In       Jordan became an independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan  but was renamed in      to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the      Arab Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in       Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in       and became one of four Arab states to sign a peace treaty with Israel in           Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co operation  The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy  but the king holds wide executive and legislative powers  Jordan is a semi arid  almost landlocked country with an area of        km          sq mi  and a population numbering    million  making it the   th most populous Arab country  Sunni Islam  practiced by around     of the population  is the dominant religion and coexists with an indigenous Christian minority  Jordan has been repeatedly referred to as an  oasis of stability  in a turbulent region  It has been mostly unscathed by the violence that swept the region following the Arab Spring in           From as early as       Jordan has accepted refugees from multiple neighbouring countries in conflict  An estimated     million Palestinian and     million Syrian refugees are present in Jordan as of a      census     The kingdom is also a refuge to thousands of Iraqi Christians fleeing persecution by ISIL      While Jordan continues to accept refugees  the recent large influx from Syria placed substantial strain on national resources and infrastructure      Jordan is classified as a country of  high human development  with an  upper middle income  economy  The Jordanian economy  one of the smallest economies in the region  is attractive to foreign investors based upon a skilled workforce      The country is a major tourist destination  also attracting medical tourism due to its well developed health sector      Nonetheless  a lack of natural resources  large flow of refugees and regional turmoil have hampered economic growth       Contents    Etymology   History      Ancient period     Classical period

also  Jordan River   Etymology Jordan takes its name from the Jordan River which forms much of the country s northwestern border       While several theories for the origin of the river s name have been proposed  it is most plausible that it derives from the Semitic word Yarad  meaning  the descender   reflecting the river s declivity      Much of the area that makes up modern Jordan was historically called Transjordan  meaning  across the Jordan   used to denote the lands east of the river      The Old Testament refers to the area as  the other side of the Jordan       Early Arab chronicles referred to the river as Al Urdunn  corresponding to the Semitic Yarden      Jund Al Urdunn was a military district around the river in the early Islamic era      Later  during the Crusades in the beginning of the second millennium  a lordship was established in the area under the name of Oultrejordain       History Main article  History of Jordan Ancient period  The  Ain Ghazal Statues  c       BC  of Amman are some of the oldest human statues ever found  The oldest evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least         years      Jordan is rich in Paleolithic  up to        years ago  remains due to its location within the Levant where expansions of hominids out of Africa converged      Past lakeshore environments attracted different hominids  and several remains of tools have been found from this period      The world s oldest evidence of bread making was found in a        years old Natufian site in Jordan s northeastern desert      The transition from hunter gatherer to establishing populous agricultural villages occurred during the Neolithic period               BC        Ain Ghazal  one such village located in today s eastern Amman  is one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the Near East      Dozens of plaster statues of the human form dating to      BC or earlier were uncovered there and they are among the oldest ever found      Other than the usual Chalcolithic            BC  villages such as Tulaylet Ghassul in the Jordan Valley      a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert whose purpose remains uncertain have baffled archaeologists        The Mesha Stele  c      BC  recorded the glory of Mesha  the King of Moab  Fortified towns and urban centers first emerged in the southern Levant early on in the Bronze Age            BC       Wadi Feynan became a regional center for copper extraction  which was exploited on a large scale to produce bronze      Trade and movement of people in the Middle East peaked  spreading and refining civilizations      Villages in Transjordan expanded rapidly in areas with reliable water resources and agricultural land      Ancient Egyptians expanded towards the Levant and controlled both banks of the Jordan River      During the Iron Age           BC  after the withdrawal of the Egyptians  Transjordan was home to Ammon  Edom and Moab      They spoke Semitic languages of the Canaanite group  and are considered to be tribal kingdoms rather than states      Ammon was located in the Amman plateau  Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea  and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba down south      The Transjordanian kingdoms of Ammon  Edom and Moab were in continuous conflict with the neighbouring Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah  centered west of the Jordan River      One record of this is the Mesha Stele erected by the Moabite king Mesha in     BC on which he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the Israelites      The stele constitutes one of the most important direct accounts of Biblical history      Around     BC  the kingdoms benefited from trade between Syria and Arabia when the Assyrian Empire increasingly controlled the Levant      Babylonians took over the empire after its disintegration in     BC      Although the kingdoms supported the Babylonians against Judah in the     BC sack of Jerusalem  they rebelled against them a decade later      The kingdoms were reduced to vassals  which they remained under the Persian and Hellenic Empires      By the beginning of Roman rule around    BC  the kingdoms of Ammon  Edom and Moab had lost their distinct identities  and were assimilated into the Roman culture       Classical period  Al Khazneh in Petra  c   st century AD   is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV  Alexander the Great s conquest of the Persian Empire in     BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East      After Alexander s death in     BC  the empire split among his generals  and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria      The Nabataeans  nomadic Arabs based south of Edom  managed to establish an independent kingdom in     BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers      The Nabataean Kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region  and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert  up to as far north as Damascus  which it controlled for a short period         BC      The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes  often drawing the envy of their neighbors      Petra  Nabataea s barren capital  flourished in the  st century AD  driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture      The Nabataeans were also talented stone carvers  building their most elaborate structure  Al Khazneh  in the first century AD      It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV      Roman legions under Pompey conquered much of the Levant in    BC  inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries      In     AD  Emperor Trajan annexed Nabataea unopposed  and rebuilt the King s Highway which became known as the Via Traiana Nova road      The Romans gave the Greek cities of Transjordan Philadelphia  Amman   Gerasa  Jerash   Gedara  Umm Qays   Pella  Tabaqat Fahl  and Arbila  Irbid  and other Hellenistic cities in Palestine and southern Syria  a level of autonomy by forming the Decapolis  a ten city league      Jerash is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the East  it was even visited by Emperor Hadrian during his journey to Palestine        The Oval Forum of Jerash  c   st century AD   then member of the ten city Roman league  the Decapolis  Seven out of the ten Decapolis cities are present in modern day Jordan  In     AD  the Roman Empire split  and the Eastern Roman Empire later known as the Byzantine Empire continued to control or influence the region until     AD      Christianity had become legal within the empire in     AD after Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity      The Edict of Thessalonka made Christianity the official state religion in     AD  Transjordan prospered during the Byzantine era  and Christian churches were built everywhere      The Aqaba Church in Ayla was built during this era  it is considered to be the world s first purpose built Christian church      Umm ar Rasas in southern Amman contains at least    Byzantine churches      Meanwhile  Petra s importance declined as sea trade routes emerged  and after a     earthquake destroyed many structures  it declined further  eventually being abandoned      The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines  rivals  and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region  including Transjordan       Islamic era In     AD  during the Battle of Mu tah in what is today Al Karak  the Byzantines and their Arab Christian clients  the Ghassanids  staved off an attack by a Muslim Rashidun force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz  in modern day Saudi Arabia       The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in     AD at the decisive Battle of Yarmouk just north of Transjordan      Transjordan was an essential territory for the conquest of Damascus      The first  or Rashidun  caliphate was followed by that of the Ummayads                Under the Umayyad Caliphate  several desert castles were constructed in Transjordan  including  Qasr Al Mshatta and Qasr Al Hallabat      The Abbasid Caliphate s campaign to take over the Umayyad s began in Transjordan      A powerful     AD earthquake is thought to have contributed to the Umayyads defeat to the Abbasids  who moved the caliphate s capital from Damascus to Baghdad      During Abbasid rule            several Arab tribes moved northwards and settled in the Levant      As had happened during the Roman era  growth of maritime trade diminished Transjordan s central position  and the area became increasingly impoverished      After the decline of the Abbasids  Transjordan was ruled by the Fatimid Caliphate             then by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem                    The Karak Castle  c    th century AD  built by the Crusaders  and later expanded under the Muslim Ayyubids and Mamluks The Crusaders constructed several Crusader castles as part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain  including those of Montreal and Al Karak      The Ayyubids built the Ajloun Castle and rebuilt older castles  to be used as military outposts against the Crusaders      During the Battle of Hattin        near Lake Tiberias just north of Transjordan  the Crusaders lost to Saladin  the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty                  Villages in Transjordan under the Ayyubids became important stops for Muslim pilgrims going to Mecca who travelled along the route that connected Syria to the Hejaz      Several of the Ayyubid castles were used and expanded by the Mamluks              who divided Transjordan between the provinces of Karak and Damascus      During the next century Transjordan experienced Mongol attacks  but the Mongols were ultimately repelled by the Mamluks after the Battle of Ain Jalut             In       the Ottoman Caliphate s forces conquered Mamluk territory      Agricultural villages in Transjordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the   th century  but were later abandoned      Transjordan was of marginal importance to the Ottoman authorities      As a result  Ottoman presence was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits      More Arab Bedouin tribes moved into Transjordan from Syria and the Hejaz during the first three centuries of Ottoman rule  including the Adwan  the Bani Sakhr and the Howeitat      These tribes laid claims to different parts of the region  and with the absence of a meaningful Ottoman authority  Transjordan slid into a state of anarchy that continued till the   th century      This led to a short lived occupation by the Wahhabi forces              an ultra orthodox Islamic movement that emerged in Najd  in modern day Saudi Arabia       Ibrahim Pasha  son of the governor of the Egypt Eyalet under the request of the Ottoman sultan  rooted out the Wahhabis by           In      Ibrahim Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule over the Levant      His oppressive policies led to the unsuccessful peasants  revolt in Palestine in           Transjordanian cities of Al Salt and Al Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha s forces for harbouring a peasants  revolt leader      Egyptian rule was forcibly ended in       with Ottoman rule restored        The Ajloun Castle  c    th century AD  built by the Ayyubid leader Saladin for use against the Crusades Only after Ibrahim Pasha s campaign did the Ottoman Empire try to solidify its presence in the Syria Vilayet  which Transjordan was part of      A series of tax and land reforms  Tanzimat  in      brought some prosperity back to agriculture and to abandoned villages  the end of virtually autonomy predictably provoked a backlash in other areas of Transjordan      Muslim Circassians and Chechens  fleeing Russian persecution  sought refuge in the Levant      In Transjordan and with Ottoman support  Circassians first settled in the long abandoned vicinity of Amman in       and later in the surrounding villages      After having established its administration  conscription and heavy taxation policies by the Ottoman authorities led to revolts in the areas it controlled      Transjordan s tribes in particular revolted during the Shoubak        and the Karak Revolts         which were brutally suppressed      The construction of the Hejaz Railway in      stretching across the length of Transjordan and linking Mecca with Istanbul helped the population economically  as Transjordan became a stopover for pilgrims      However  increasing policies of Turkification and centralization adopted by the Ottoman Empire disenchanted the Arabs of the Levant   Modern era Main article  Emirate of Transjordan  Soldiers of the Hashemite led Arab Army holding the flag of the Great Arab Revolt in      Four centuries of stagnation during Ottoman rule came to an end during World War I by the      Arab Revolt  driven by long term resentment towards the Ottoman authorities and growing Arab nationalism      The revolt was led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca  and his sons Abdullah  Faisal and Ali  members of the Hashemite family of the Hejaz  descendants of the Prophet Muhammad      Locally  the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian tribes  including Bedouins  Circassians and Christians      The Allies of World War I  including Britain and France  whose imperial interests converged with the Arabist cause  offered support      The revolt started on   June      from Medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on   July           The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October       and established an Arab led military administration in OETA East  later declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria  both of which Transjordan was part of      During this period  the southernmost region of the country  including Ma an and Aqaba  was also claimed by the neighboring Kingdom of Hejaz  The nascent Hashemite Kingdom over Greater Syria was forced to surrender to French troops on    July      during the Battle of Maysalun      the French occupied only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom  leaving Transjordan in a period of interregnum  Arab aspirations failed to gain international recognition  due mainly to the secret      Sykes Picot Agreement  which divided the region into French and British spheres of influence  and the      Balfour Declaration  which promised Palestine to Jews      This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British      including the      McMahon Hussein Correspondence  in which the British stated their willingness to recognize the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo to Aden under the rule of the Hashemites        Al Salt residents gather on    August      during the British High Commissioner s visit to Transjordan  The British High Commissioner  Herbert Samuel  travelled to Transjordan on    August      to meet with Al Salt s residents  He there declared to a crowd of six hundred Transjordanian notables that the British government would aid the establishment of local governments in Transjordan  which is to be kept separate from that of Palestine  The second meeting took place in Umm Qais on   September  where the British government representative Major Fitzroy Somerset received a petition that demanded  an independent Arab government in Transjordan to be led by an Arab prince  emir   land sale in Transjordan to Jews be stopped as well as the prevention of Jewish immigration there  that Britiain establish and fund a national army  and that free trade be maintained between Transjordan and the rest of the region      Abdullah  the second son of Sharif Hussein  arrived from Hejaz by train in Ma an in southern Transjordan on    November      to redeem the Greater Syrian Kingdom his brother had lost      Transjordan then was in disarray  widely considered to be ungovernable with its dysfunctional local governments      Abdullah gained the trust of Transjordan s tribal leaders before scrambling to convince them of the benefits of an organized government      Abdullah s successes drew the envy of the British  even when it was in their interest      The British reluctantly accepted Abdullah as ruler of Transjordan after having given him a six month trial      In March       the British decided to add Transjordan to their Mandate for Palestine  in which they would implement their  Sharifian Solution  policy without applying the provisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement  On    April       the Emirate of Transjordan was established with Abdullah as Emir      In September       the Council of the League of Nations recognised Transjordan as a state under the terms of the Transjordan memorandum          Transjordan remained a British mandate until       but it had been granted a greater level of autonomy than the region west of the Jordan River      Multiple difficulties emerged upon the assumption of power in the region by the Hashemite leadership      In Transjordan  small local rebellions at Kura in      and      were suppressed by the Emir s forces with the help of the British      Wahhabis from Najd regained strength and repeatedly raided the southern parts of his territory in              seriously threatening the Emir s position      The Emir was unable to repel those raids without the aid of the local Bedouin tribes and the British  who maintained a military base with a small RAF detachment close to Amman       Post independence Main article  Timeline of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  King Abdullah I on    May      reading the declaration of independence  The Treaty of London  signed by the British Government and the Emir of Transjordan on    March       recognised the independence of Transjordan upon ratification by both countries  parliaments      On    May       the day that the treaty was ratified by the Transjordan parliament  Transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom under the name of the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan  with Abdullah as its first king      The name was shortened to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on    April              May is now celebrated as the nation s Independence Day  a public holiday      Jordan became a member of the United Nations on    December           On    May       as part of the      Arab Israeli War  Jordan intervened in Palestine together with many other Arab states      Following the war  Jordan controlled the West Bank and on    April      Jordan formally annexed these territories after the Jericho conference          In response  some Arab countries demanded Jordan s expulsion from the Arab League      On    June       the Arab League declared that the annexation was a temporary  practical measure and that Jordan was holding the territory as a  trustee  pending a future settlement      King Abdullah was assassinated at the Al Aqsa Mosque in      by a Palestinian militant  amid rumours he intended to sign a peace treaty with Israel      Abdullah was succeeded by his son Talal  who would soon abdicate due to illness in favour of his eldest son Hussein      Talal established the country s modern constitution in           Hussein ascended to the throne in      at the age of         Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period       The     s were a period of political upheaval  as Nasserism and Pan Arabism swept the Arab World       On   March       King Hussein Arabized the command of the Army by dismissing a number of senior British officers  an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country       In       Jordan and neighbouring Hashemite Iraq formed the Arab Federation as a response to the formation of the rival United Arab Republic between Nasser s Egypt and Syria       The union lasted only six months  being dissolved after Iraqi King Faisal II  Hussein s cousin  was deposed by a bloody military coup on    July              King Hussein on    March      checking an abandoned Israeli tank in the aftermath of the Battle of Karameh  Jordan signed a military pact with Egypt just before Israel launched a preemptive strike on Egypt to begin the Six Day War in June       where Jordan and Syria joined the war       The Arab states were defeated and Jordan lost control of the West Bank to Israel       The War of Attrition with Israel followed  which included the      Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO  repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank       Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces  the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world       As a result  the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements  the fedayeen  within Jordan from other Arab countries       The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan s rule of law       In September       the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon  in a conflict that became known as Black September       In       Egypt and Syria waged the Yom Kippur War on Israel  and fighting occurred along the      Jordan River cease fire line       Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to attack Israeli units on Syrian territory but did not engage Israeli forces from Jordanian territory       At the Rabat summit conference in       in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War  Jordan agreed  along with the rest of the Arab League  that the PLO was the  sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people        Subsequently  Jordan renounced its claims to the West Bank in            At the      Madrid Conference  Jordan agreed to negotiate a peace treaty sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union       The Israel Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed on    October            In       in retribution for a bombing  Israeli agents entered Jordan using Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal  a senior Hamas leader living in Jordan       Bowing to intense international pressure  Israel provided an antidote to the poison and released dozens of political prisoners  including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin  after King Hussein threatened to annul the peace treaty         Army Chief Habis Majali and Prime Minister Wasfi Tal during a military parade in       two widely acclaimed national figures  On   February       Abdullah II ascended the throne upon the death of his father Hussein  who had ruled for nearly    years       Abdullah embarked on economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne  and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until            Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment  improving public private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba s free trade zone and Jordan s flourishing information and communication technology  ICT  sector       He also set up five other special economic zones       However  during the following years Jordan s economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring       Al Qaeda under Abu Musab al Zarqawi s leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman on   November       resulting in    deaths and     injured       The bombings  which targeted civilians  caused widespread outrage among Jordanians       The attack is considered to be a rare event in the country  and Jordan s internal security was dramatically improved afterwards       No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then       Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country s peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West       The Arab Spring were large scale protests that erupted in the Arab World in       demanding economic and political reforms       Many of these protests tore down regimes in some Arab nations  leading to instability that ended with violent civil wars       In Jordan  in response to domestic unrest  Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduced a number of reforms including  reforming the Constitution  and laws governing public freedoms and elections       Proportional representation was re introduced to the Jordanian parliament in the      general election  a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments       Jordan was left largely unscathed from the violence that swept the region despite an influx of
