as the Ohio College Library Center  through a collaboration of university presidents  vice presidents  and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative  computerized network for libraries in the state of Ohio  The group first met on July          on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization    and hired Frederick G  Kilgour  a former Yale University medical school librarian  to design the shared cataloging system     Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time  the computer  with the oldest  the library  The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations  control costs  and increase efficiency in library management  bringing libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world s information in order to best serve researchers and scholars  The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August           This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide     Membership in OCLC is based on use of services and contribution of data  Between      and       OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio  but in       a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join  In       the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States     As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio  it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with  networks   organizations that provided training  support and marketing services  By       there were    independent United States regional service providers  OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance  with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council  During       OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels  at the same time  the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance  In early       OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center      Services edit  OCLC provides bibliographic  abstract and full text information to anyone  OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat the OCLC Online Union Catalog  the largest online public access catalog  OPAC  in the world     WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide  The Online Computer Library Center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification System when it bought Forest Press in       A browser     for books with their Dewey Decimal Classifications was available until July       it was replaced by the Classify Service  Until August       when it was sold to Backstage Library Works  OCLC owned a preservation microfilm and digitization operation called the OCLC Preservation Service Center      with its principal office in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  Starting in       OCLC produced catalog cards for members alongside its shared online catalog  the company printed its last catalog cards on October               QuestionPoint edit  QuestionPoint      an around the clock reference service provided to users by a cooperative of participating global libraries  was acquired by Springshare from OCLC in      and migrated to Springshare s LibAnswers platform           Software edit  OCLC commercially sells software  such as   CONTENTdm for managing digital collections             Wise  an integrated library system and  community engagement system          WorldCat Discovery  a bibliographic discovery system that allows library patrons to use a single search interface to access an institution s catalog  ebooks  database subscriptions and more         WorldShare Management Services  an electronic resource management system         Research edit  OCLC has been conducting research for the library community for more than    years  In accordance with its mission  OCLC makes its research outcomes known through various publications      These publications  including journal articles  reports  newsletters  and presentations  are available through the organization s website   OCLC Publications   Research articles from various journals including The Code Lib Journal  OCLC Research  Reference and User Services Quarterly  College   Research Libraries News  Art Libraries Journal  and National Education Association Newsletter  The most recent publications are displayed first  and all archived resources  starting in       are also available      Membership Reports   A number of significant reports on topics ranging from virtual reference in libraries to perceptions about library funding      Newsletters   Current and archived newsletters for the library and archive community      Presentations   Presentations from both guest speakers and OCLC research from conferences  webcasts  and other events  The presentations are organized into five categories  Conference presentations  Dewey presentations  Distinguished Seminar Series  Guest presentations  and Research staff presentations      Advocacy edit  Advocacy has been a part of OCLC s mission since its founding in       OCLC staff members meet and work regularly with library leaders  information professionals  researchers  entrepreneurs  political leaders  trustees  students and patrons to advocate  advancing research  scholarship  education  community development  information access  and global cooperation           WebJunction  which provides training services to librarians      is a division of OCLC funded by grants from the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation beginning in               OCLC partnered with search engine providers in      to advocate for libraries and share information across the Internet landscape  Google  Yahoo   and Ask com all collaborated with OCLC to make WorldCat records searchable through those search engines      OCLC s advocacy campaign  Geek the Library   started in       highlights the role of public libraries  The campaign  funded by a grant from the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  uses a strategy based on the findings of the      OCLC report   From Awareness to Funding  A study of library support in America       Other past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research  Such projects have included communities such as the Society of American Archivists  the Open Archives Initiative  the Institute for Museum and Library Services  the International Organization for Standardization  the National Information Standards Organization  the World Wide Web Consortium  the Internet Engineering Task Force  and Internet   One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative   an open forum of libraries  archives  museums  technology organizations  and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models       OCLC has collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia volunteer community  through integrating library metadata with Wikimedia projects  hosting a Wikipedian in residence  and doing a national training program through WebJunction called  Wikipedia   Libraries  Better Together                Online database  WorldCat edit  Main article  WorldCat OCLC s WorldCat database is used by the general public and by librarians for cataloging and research  WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web based service called FirstSearch      as well as through the publicly available WorldCat org       Identifiers and linked data edit  OCLC assigns a unique control number  referred to as an  OCN  for  OCLC Control Number   to each new bibliographic record in the WorldCat  Numbers are assigned serially  and as of mid      over a billion OCNs had been created  In September       the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the public domain  removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself       The control numbers link WorldCat s records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries      OCNs are particularly useful as identifiers for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have ISBNs  e g   books published before        OCNs are used as identifiers often in Wikipedia and Wikidata  In October       it was reported that out of        instances of book infoboxes in Wikipedia   there were        ISBNs and        OCNs   and regarding Wikidata   of around    million Wikidata items         were books       Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them  and        have OCNs       OCLC also runs the Virtual International Authority File  VIAF   an international name authority file  with oversight from the VIAF Council composed of representatives of institutions that contribute data to VIAF      VIAF numbers are broadly used as standard identifiers  including in Wikipedia           Company acquisitions edit   OCLC offices in Leiden  the Netherlands  OCLC acquired NetLibrary  a provider of electronic books and textbooks  in      and sold it in      to EBSCO Industries      OCLC owns      of the shares of OCLC PICA  a library automation systems and services company which has its headquarters in Leiden in the Netherlands and which was renamed  OCLC  at the end of           In July       the Research Libraries Group  RLG  merged with OCLC          On January           OCLC announced     that it had purchased EZproxy  It has also acquired OAIster  The process started in January      and from October           OAIster records are freely available via WorldCat org  In      OCLC acquired the Dutch library automation company HKA         and its integrated library system Wise      which OCLC calls a  community engagement system  that  combines the power of customer relationship management  marketing  and analytics with ILS functions       OCLC began offering Wise to libraries in the United States in           In January       OCLC acquired Sustainable Collection Services  SCS   SCS offered consulting services based on analyzing library print collection data to help libraries manage and share materials      In       OCLC acquired Relais International  a library interlibrary loan service provider based in Ottawa  Canada       Criticism edit  In May       OCLC was criticized by Jeffrey Beall for monopolistic practices  among other faults      Library blogger Rick Mason responded that although he thought Beall had some  valid criticisms  of OCLC  he demurred from some of Beall s statements and warned readers to  beware the hyperbole and the personal nature of his criticism  for they strongly overshadow that which is worth stating       In November       the Board of Directors of OCLC unilaterally issued a new Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records     that would have required member libraries to include an OCLC policy note on their bibliographic records  the policy caused an uproar among librarian bloggers          Among those who protested the policy was the non librarian activist Aaron Swartz  who believed the policy would threaten projects such as the Open Library  Zotero  and Wikipedia  and who started a petition to  Stop the OCLC powergrab           Swartz s petition garnered     signatures  but the details of his proposed actions went largely unheeded      Within a few months  the library community had forced OCLC to retract its policy and to create a Review Board to consult with member libraries more transparently      In August       OCLC recommended that member libraries adopt the Open Data Commons Attribution  ODC BY  license when sharing library catalog data  although some member libraries have explicit agreements with OCLC that they can publish catalog data using the CC  Public Domain Dedication          In July       the company was sued by SkyRiver  a rival startup  in an antitrust suit      Library automation company Innovative Interfaces joined SkyRiver in the suit      The suit was dropped in March       however  following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces      Innovative Interfaces was later bought by ExLibris  therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of ILS services in the USA  over     market share for academic libraries and over     for public libraries for ExLibris  versus OCLC s     market share of both types of libraries
