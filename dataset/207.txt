was a United States agency devoted to  public diplomacy   In       USIA s broadcasting functions were moved to the newly created Broadcasting Board of Governors  and its exchange and non broadcasting information functions were given to the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the U S  Department of State  The agency was previously known overseas as the United States Information Service  USIS   Former USIA Director Alvin Snyder recalled in his      memoir that  the U S  government ran a full service public relations organization  the largest in the world  about the size of the twenty biggest U S  commercial PR firms combined  Its full time professional staff of more than        spread out among some     countries  burnished America s image and trashed the Soviet Union       hours a week with a tower of babble comprised of more than    languages  to the tune of over    billion per year   and  the biggest branch of this propaganda machine

External links   Stated mission edit  President Dwight D  Eisenhower established the United States Information Agency in             The USIA s mission was  to understand  inform and influence foreign publics in promotion of the national interest  and to broaden the dialogue between Americans and U S  institutions  and their counterparts abroad      The United States Information Agency  USIA  was established  to streamline the U S  government s overseas information programs  and make them more effective      The United States Information Agency was the largest full service public relations organization in the world  spending over    billion per year to highlight the views of the U S  while diminishing those of the Soviet Union  through about     different countries     Its stated goals were   To explain and advocate U S  policies in terms that are credible and meaningful in foreign cultures  To provide information about the official policies of the United States  and about the people  values and institutions which influence those policies  To bring the benefits of international engagement to American citizens and institutions by helping them build strong long term relationships with their counterparts overseas  To advise the President and U S  government policy makers on the ways in which foreign attitudes will have a direct bearing on the effectiveness of U S  policies     Propaganda played a large role in how the United States was viewed by the world during the Cold War  American propagandists felt as though the Hollywood movie industry was destroying the image of the United States in other countries     In response to the negative portrayal of the U S  from communist propaganda the  USIA exist ed  as much to provide a view of the world to the United States as it  did  to give the world a view of America      The purpose of the USIA within the United States was to assure Americans that    t he United States was working for a better world      Abroad  the USIA aimed to preserve a positive image of the U S  regardless of negative depictions from communist propaganda  One notable example was Project Pedro  a secretly funded project to create newsreels in Mexico during the     s that portrayed Communism unfavorably and the United States positively     Journalistic articles reflecting the views promoted by the USIA were frequently published under fictitious bylines  such as  Guy Sims Fitch          In order to accomplish the advisory portion of its mission  the agency conducted research on foreign public opinion about the United States and its policies  in order to inform the president and other key policymakers      The agency did this through public opinion surveys throughout the world  It then issued a variety of reports to government officials  including a twice daily report on foreign media commentary around the world       Media and divisions edit   USIA library in Johannesburg  South Africa  in       during the apartheid era  From the beginning  Dwight Eisenhower said   audiences would be more receptive to the American message if they were kept from identifying it as propaganda  Avowedly propagandistic materials from the United States might convince few  but the same viewpoints presented by the seemingly independent voices would be more persuasive      According to the Kennedy memorandum  the USIA utilized various forms of media  including  personal contact  radio broadcasting  libraries  book publication and distribution  press motion pictures  television  exhibits  English language instruction  and others   Through these different forms  the United States government was able to distribute and disguise the propaganda more easily and engage a greater concentration of people     Four main divisions existed at the beginning of the USIA s propaganda effort     The first division dealt with broadcasting information both in the United States and around the world  One of the most widely used forms of media at the onset of the Cold War was the radio  The Smith Mundt Act authorized information programs  including Voice of America      Voice of America was intended as an unbiased and balanced  Voice from America  as originally broadcast during World War II  The VOA was used to  tell America s stories     to information deprived listeners behind the Iron Curtain      By       the VOA was broadcasting in    languages to up to    million listeners     In      VOA gained its so called  Charter  which required its news to be balanced  The second division of the USIA consisted of libraries and exhibits  The Smith Mundt Act and the Fulbright Hays Act of      both authorized the international cultural and educational exchanges  the Fulbright Scholarship Program   Thus  Fulbrighters  were grant recipients under the USIA educational and cultural exchange program  To ensure that those grant programs would be fair and unbiased  there were a series of grantees of educational and cultural expertise who chose the actual grantee recipients  The USIA s third division included press services  Within its first two decades the  USIA publishe d  sixty six magazines  newspapers  and other periodicals  totaling almost    million copies annually  in twenty eight languages      The fourth division dealt with the motion picture service  After the USIA s failed attempts to collaborate with Hollywood filmmakers to portray America in a positive light  the agency began producing their own documentaries      Non broadcast educational and information efforts edit  By the time of the agency s reorganization in       the educational and informational efforts encompassed a wide range of activities  outside of broadcasting  focused in four areas  The agency produced electronic and printed materials  most notably a product known as The Washington File information service  intended to provide  in the words of the agency  both time sensitive and in depth information in five languages   incorporation full transcripts of speeches  Congressional testimony  articles by Administration officials  and materials providing analysis of key issues  The Agency also ran a number of websites to transmit information      Second  the agency ran a  Speakers and Specialists Program   sending Americans abroad for various public speaking and technical assistance roles      These speakers were referred to as  American Participants  or  AmParts   Third  the agency ran over      Information Resource Centers  abroad  including some public access libraries in developing countries      Finally  the USIA operated foreign press centers in Washington  New York  and Los Angeles to  assist resident and visiting foreign journalists   while also working in cooperation with other international press centers in other major cities  such as Chicago  Houston  Atlanta  Miami  and Seattle      Additionally  beginning with the      Brussels World Fair  the USIA was responsible for the design  construction  and operation of the U S  pavilions representing America at major world Expos       Abolition and restructuring edit  The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of       Division G of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act        Pub L           text   pdf       Stat            enacted October           abolished the U S  Information Agency effective October          when its information  but not broadcasting  and exchange functions were folded into the Department of State under the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs  At the time of its abolition  its budget was        billion  After reductions of staff in       the agency had       employees  of which almost half were civil service employees in the United States          About       of these employees worked in international broadcasting  while approximately       focused on the agency s educational and informational programs  such as the Fulbright program      Foreign service officers were also a significant portion of the work force  about         Broadcasting functions  including Voice of America  Radio and TV Marti as well as other U S  government supported broadcasting  such as Radio Free Europe  in Eastern Europe   Radio Free Asia and Radio Liberty  in the former Soviet Union   were consolidated as an independent entity under the Broadcasting Board of Governors  BBG   which continues independently  as a separate entity from the State Department  today   See also edit
