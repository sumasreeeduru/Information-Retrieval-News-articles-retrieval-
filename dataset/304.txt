narrative of noteworthy events at Rome     Its contents were partly official  court news  decrees of the Roman emperor  Roman Senate and Roman magistrates   partly private  notices of births  marriages and deaths   Thus to some extent it filled the place of the modern newspaper     The origin of the Acta is attributed to Julius Caesar  who first ordered the keeping and publishing of the acts of the people by public officers     B C   Suetonius  Caesar       The Acta were drawn up from day to day  and exposed in a public place on a whitened board called an Album  After remaining there for a reasonable time they were taken down and preserved with other public documents  so that they might be available for purposes of research     The Acta differed from the Annals  which were discontinued in     B C   in that only the greater and more important matters were given in the latter  while in the former things of less note were recorded  Their publication continued till the transference of the seat of the empire to Constantinople  There are no genuine fragments extant     Sometimes scribes made copies of the Acta and sent them to governors for information  Later emperors used them to announce royal or senatorial decrees and events of the court  Other forms of Acta were legal  municipal and military notices  citation needed  Acta Diurna introduced the expression  publicare et propagare   which means  make public and propagate   This expression was set in the end of the texts and proclaimed a release to both Roman citizens and non citizens  citation needed
