the Linux kernel and other open source software  designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets  Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google  It was unveiled in November       with the first commercial Android device launched in September       It is free and open source software  its source code is known as Android Open Source Project  AOSP   which is primarily licensed under the Apache License  However most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre installed      most notably Google Mobile Services  GMS      which includes core apps such as Google Chrome  the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform  About    percent of Android smartphones run Google s ecosystem      competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS  developed by Amazon  or LineageOS  However the  Android  name and logo are trademarks of Google which impose standards to restrict  uncertified  devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding          The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics  such as game consoles  digital cameras  portable media players  PCs and others  each with a specialized user interface  Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables  both developed by Google  Software packages on Android  which use the APK format  are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store  Samsung Galaxy Store  and Huawei AppGallery  or open source platforms like Aptoide or F Droid  Android has been the best selling OS worldwide on smartphones since      and on tablets since       As of May      update   it has over two billion monthly active users  the largest installed base of any operating system  and as of August      update   the Google Play Store features over   million apps      The current stable version is Android     released on September           Contents    History   Features      Interface     Applications     Memory management     Hardware

History See also  Android version history First Android logotype            Second Android logotype            Third Android logotype       present  Android Inc  was founded in Palo Alto  California  in October      by Andy Rubin  Rich Miner  Nick Sears  and Chris White          Rubin described the Android project as  tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner s location and preferences       The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras  and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April           The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals  and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile          Rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on  and Android was facing eviction from its office space  Steve Perlman  a close friend of Rubin  brought him         in cash in an envelope  and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding  Perlman refused a stake in the company  and has stated  I did it because I believed in the thing  and I wanted to help Andy           In July           Google acquired Android Inc  for at least     million      Its key employees  including Rubin  Miner  Sears  and White  joined Google as part of the acquisition      Not much was known about the secretive Android at the time  with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones      At Google  the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel  Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible  upgradeable system      Google had  lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation   attribution needed      Speculation about Google s intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December           An early prototype had a close resemblance to a BlackBerry phone  with no touchscreen and a physical QWERTY keyboard  but the arrival of      s Apple iPhone meant that Android  had to go back to the drawing board           Google later changed its Android specification documents to state that  Touchscreens will be supported   although  the Product was designed with the presence of discrete physical buttons as an assumption  therefore a touchscreen cannot completely replace physical buttons       By       both Nokia and BlackBerry announced touch based smartphones to rival the iPhone  G  and Android s focus eventually switched to just touchscreens  The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream  also known as T Mobile G   announced on September                     HTC Dream or T Mobile G   the first commercially released device running Android        On November          the Open Handset Alliance  a consortium of technology companies including Google  device manufacturers such as HTC  Motorola and Samsung  wireless carriers such as Sprint and T Mobile  and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments  unveiled itself  with a goal to develop  the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices               Within a year  the Open Handset Alliance faced two other open source competitors  the Symbian Foundation and the LiMo Foundation  the latter also developing a Linux based mobile operating system like Google  In September       InformationWeek covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony          Since       Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system  adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases  Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat  with the first few Android versions being called  Cupcake    Donut    Eclair   and  Froyo   in that order  During its announcement of Android KitKat in       Google explained that  Since these devices make our lives so sweet  each Android version is named after a dessert   although a Google spokesperson told CNN in an interview that  It s kind of like an internal team thing  and we prefer to be a little bit   how should I say   a bit inscrutable in the matter  I ll say       In       Google launched its Nexus series of devices  a lineup in which Google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions  The series was described as having  played a pivotal role in Android s history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board   and became known for its  bloat free  software with  timely     updates       At its developer conference in May       Google announced a special version of the Samsung Galaxy S   where  instead of using Samsung s own Android customization  the phone ran  stock Android  and was promised to receive new system updates fast      The device would become the start of the Google Play edition program  and was followed by other devices  including the HTC One Google Play edition      and Moto G Google Play edition      In       Ars Technica wrote that  Earlier this week  the last of the Google Play edition Android phones in Google s online storefront were listed as  no longer available for sale  and that  Now they re all gone  and it looks a whole lot like the program has wrapped up             Eric Schmidt  Andy Rubin and Hugo Barra at a      press conference announcing Google s Nexus   tablet From      to       Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson  representing Android at press conferences and Google I O  Google s annual developer focused conference  He left Google in August      to join Chinese phone maker Xiaomi          Less than six months earlier  Google s then CEO Larry Page announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google  and that Sundar Pichai would become the new Android lead          Pichai himself would eventually switch positions  becoming the new CEO of Google in August      following the company s restructure into the Alphabet conglomerate          making Hiroshi Lockheimer the new head of Android          In June       Google announced Android One  a set of  hardware reference models  that would  allow  device makers  to easily create high quality phones at low costs   designed for consumers in developing countries              In September  Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India          However  Recode reported in June      that the project was  a disappointment   citing  reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners  and  misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware       Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August           with Africa announced as the next location for the program a week later          A report from The Information in January      stated that Google is expanding its low cost Android One program into the United States  although The Verge notes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices itself          Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October       marketed as being the first phones made by Google          and exclusively featured certain software features  such as the Google Assistant  before wider rollout          The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series      with a new generation of Pixel phones launched in October           In May       the operating system became entangled in the trade war between China and the United States involving Huawei  which  like many other tech firms  had become dependent on access to the Android platform          In the summer of       Huawei announced it would create an alternative operating system to Android         known as Harmony OS      and has filed for intellectual property rights across major global markets          Huawei does not currently have any plans to replace Android in the near future  as Harmony OS is designed for internet of things devices  rather than for smartphones      On August           it was announced that Android  Q  would officially be branded as Android     ending the historic practice of naming major versions after desserts  Google stated that these names were not  inclusive  to international users  due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known  or being difficult to pronounce in some languages           On the same day  Android Police reported that Google had commissioned a statue of a giant number      to be installed in the lobby of the developers  new office      Android    was released on September         to Google Pixel phones first   Features See also  List of features in Android Interface  Android    homescreen on a Pixel Android s default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation  using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real world actions  like swiping  tapping  pinching  and reverse pinching to manipulate on screen objects  along with a virtual keyboard      Game controllers and full size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB          The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface  often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user  Internal hardware  such as accelerometers  gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions  for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented      or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device  simulating control of a steering wheel      Android devices boot to the homescreen  the primary navigation and information  hub  on Android devices  analogous to the desktop found on personal computers  Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets  app icons launch the associated app  whereas widgets display live  auto updating content  such as a weather forecast  the user s email inbox  or a news ticker directly on the homescreen      A homescreen may be made up of several pages  between which the user can swipe back and forth      Third party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re theme the homescreen      and even mimic the look of other operating systems  such as Windows Phone      Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors        Widgets and App Shortcuts on Android    home screen  on Motorola G   Along the top of the screen is a status bar  showing information about the device and its connectivity  This status bar can be  pulled  down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates      Notifications are  short  timely  and relevant information about your app when it s not in use   and when tapped  users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification      Beginning with Android      Jelly Bean    expandable notifications  allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification        Notification tray displaying both active and silent notifications An All Apps screen lists all installed applications  with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen  A Recents screen lets users switch between recently used apps        Recent apps on Android     Motorola G   Applications Many  to almost all  Android devices come with preinstalled Google apps including Gmail  Google Maps  Google Chrome  YouTube  Google Play Music  Google Play Movies   TV  and many more  See also  Android software development and Google Play Applications   apps    which extend the functionality of devices  and must be    bit       are written using the Android software development kit  SDK      and  often  Kotlin programming language  which replaced Java as Google s preferred language for Android app development in May           and was originally announced in May               Java is still supported  originally the only option for user space programs  and is often mixed with Kotlin   as is C        Java and or other JVM languages  such as Kotlin  may be combined with C C        together with a choice of non default runtimes that allow better C   support      The Go programming language is also supported  although with a limited set of application programming interfaces  API       The SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools       including a debugger  software libraries  a handset emulator based on QEMU  documentation  sample code  and tutorials  Initially  Google s supported integrated development environment  IDE  was Eclipse using the Android Development Tools  ADT  plugin  in December       Google released Android Studio  based on IntelliJ IDEA  as its primary IDE for Android application development  Other development tools are available  including a native development kit  NDK  for applications or extensions in C or C    Google App Inventor  a visual environment for novice programmers  and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks  In January       Google unveiled a framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome HTML   web applications to Android  wrapped in a native application shell       Additionally  Firebase was acquired by Google in      that provides helpful tools for app and web developers            Android has a growing selection of third party applications  which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application s APK  Android application package  file  or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install  update  and remove applications from their devices  Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google s compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software            Google Play Store allows users to browse  download and update applications published by Google and third party developers  as of August      update   there are more than three million applications available for Android in Play Store           As of July      update      billion applications have been installed            Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Google Play application purchases  where the cost of the application is added to the user s monthly bill       As of May      update   there are over one billion active users a month for Gmail  Android  Chrome  Google Play and Maps  Due to the open nature of Android  a number of third party application marketplaces also exist for Android  either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store  provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations  or for other reasons  Examples of these third party stores have included the Amazon Appstore  GetJar  and SlideMe  F Droid  another alternative marketplace  seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses                      In October       Google removed several Android applications from Play Store  as they were identified breaching its data collection rules  The firm was informed by International Digital Accountability Council  IDAC  that apps for children like Number Coloring  Princess Salon and Cats   Cosplay  with collective downloads of    million  were violating Google s policies        Memory management Since Android devices are usually battery powered  Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum  When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that  while available for immediate use rather than closed  it does not use battery power or CPU resources            Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically  when memory is low  the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes  starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time            Lifehacker reported in      that third party task killer applications were doing more harm than good        Hardware See also  Android hardware requirements The main hardware platform for Android is ARM  the ARMv  and ARMv  A architectures   with x   and x      architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android                      The unofficial Android x   project provided support for x   architectures ahead of the official support            The ARMv TE and MIPS      architectures were also historically supported but removed in later Android releases       Since       Android devices with Intel processors began to appear  including phones      and tablets  While gaining support for    bit platforms  Android was first made to run on    bit x   and then on ARM    Since Android      Lollipop      bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the    bit variants       Requirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android     range from in practice   GB for best hardware  down to   GB for the most common screen  to absolute minimum     MB for the lowest spec    bit smartphone  The recommendation for Android     is to have at least     MB of RAM       while for  low RAM  devices     MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor       Android     requires a    bit ARMv   MIPS or x   architecture processor  latter two through unofficial ports             together with an OpenGL ES     compatible graphics processing unit  GPU        Android supports OpenGL ES                    and     and since Android     Vulkan  and version     available for some devices        Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES  and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications       Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components  including still or video cameras  GPS  orientation sensors  dedicated gaming controls  accelerometers  gyroscopes  barometers  magnetometers  proximity sensors  pressure sensors  thermometers  and touchscreens  Some hardware components are not required  but became standard in certain classes of devices  such as smartphones  and additional requirements apply if they are present  Some other hardware was initially required  but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether  For example  as Android was developed initially as a phone OS  hardware such as microphones were required  while over time the phone function became optional       Android used to require an autofocus camera  which was relaxed to a fixed focus camera      if present at all  since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set top boxes  In addition to running on smartphones and tablets  several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with a keyboard and mouse                      In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware  similar PC hardware friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android x   project  including customized Android           Using the Android emulator that is part of the Android SDK  or third party emulators  Android can also run non natively on x   architectures            Chinese companies are building a PC and mobile operating system  based on Android  to  compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android        The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that  more than a dozen  companies were customising Android following a Chinese ban on the use of Windows   on government PCs                  Development  The stack of Android Open Source Project Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released  at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project  AOSP        an open source initiative led by Google       The AOSP code can be found without modification on select devices  mainly the former Nexus and current Android One series of devices       The source code is  in turn  customized by original equipment manufacturers  OEMs  to run on their hardware            Android s source code does not contain the device drivers  often proprietary  that are needed for certain hardware components       As a result  most Android devices  including Google s own  ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software  with the software required for accessing Google services falling into the latter category  citation needed   Update schedule See also  Android version history Google announces major incremental upgrades to Android on a yearly basis       The updates can be installed on devices over the air       The latest major release is Android     The extensive variation of hardware      in Android devices has caused significant delays for software upgrades and security patches  Each upgrade has had to be specifically tailored  a time  and resource consuming process       Except for devices within the Google Nexus and Pixel brands  updates have often arrived months after the release of the new version  or not at all        Manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind       Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who  after receiving updates from manufacturers  further customize Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending out the upgrade            There are also situations in which upgrades are impossible due to a manufacturer not updating necessary drivers       The lack of after sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media                 Some commentators have noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their devices  as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones       an attitude described as  insulting        The Guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way       In       Google partnered with a number of industry players to announce an  Android Update Alliance   pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for    months after its release  however  there has not been another official word about that alliance since its announcement            In       Google began de coupling certain aspects of the operating system  particularly its central applications  so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS  One of those components  Google Play Services  is a closed source system level process providing APIs for Google services  installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android      Froyo  and higher  With these changes  Google can add new system functions  and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself       As a result  Android     and      Jelly Bean  contained relatively fewer user facing changes  focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements       HTC s then executive Jason Mackenzie called monthly security updates  unrealistic  in       and Google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures   In May       Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Google was making efforts to keep Android more up to date  including accelerated rates of security updates  rolling out technological workarounds  reducing requirements for phone testing  and ranking phone makers in an attempt to  shame  them into better behavior  As stated by Bloomberg   As smartphones get more capable  complex and hackable  having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important   Hiroshi Lockheimer  the Android lead  admitted that  It s not an ideal situation   further commenting that the lack of updates is  the weakest link on security on Android   Wireless carriers were described in the report as the  most challenging discussions   due to their slow approval time while testing on their networks  despite some carriers  including Verizon Wireless and Sprint Corporation  already shortening their approval times   In a further effort for persuasion  Google shared a list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its Android partners  and is considering making the list public  when   Mike Chan  co founder of phone maker Nextbit and former Android developer  said that  The best way to solve this problem is a massive re architecture of the operating system    or Google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers  to be good Android citizens                   In May       with the announcement of Android      Google introduced Project Treble  a major re architect of the Android OS framework designed to make it easier  faster  and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to newer versions of Android  Project Treble separates the vendor implementation  device specific  lower level software written by silicon manufacturers  from the Android OS framework via a new  vendor interface   In Android     and earlier  no formal vendor interface exists  so device makers must update large portions of the Android code to move a device to a newer version of the operating system  With Treble  the new stable vendor interface provides access to the hardware specific parts of Android  enabling device makers to deliver new Android releases simply by updating the Android OS framework   without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers        In September       Google s Project Treble team revealed that  as part of their efforts to improve the security lifecycle of Android devices  Google had managed to get the Linux Foundation to agree to extend the support lifecycle of the Linux Long Term Support  LTS  kernel branch from the   years that it has historically lasted to   years for future versions of the LTS kernel  starting with Linux kernel           In May       with the announcement of Android     Google introduced Project Mainline to simplify and expedite delivery of updates to the Android ecosystem  Project Mainline enables updates to core OS components through the Google Play Store  As a result  important security and performance improvements that previously needed to be part of full OS updates can be downloaded and installed as easily as an app update       Google reported rolling out new amendments in Android    aimed at making the use of third party application stores easier  This announcement rectified the concerns reported regarding the development of Android app  including a fight over an alternative in app payment system and difficulties faced by businesses moving online because of COVID           Linux kernel Android s kernel is based on the Linux kernel s long term support  LTS  branches  As of      update   Android uses versions          or      of the Linux kernel       The actual kernel depends on the individual device       Android s variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle  such as the inclusion of components like device trees  ashmem  ION  and different out of memory  OOM  handling            Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel  notably a power management feature called  wakelocks        were initially rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code            Google announced in April      that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community       but Greg Kroah Hartman  the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch  said in December      that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux       Google engineer Patrick Brady once stated in the company s developer conference that  Android is not Linux        with Computerworld adding that  Let me make it simple for you  without Linux  there is no Android        Ars Technica wrote that  Although Android is built on top of the Linux kernel  the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop Linux stack        In August       Linus Torvalds said that  eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel  but it will probably not be for four to five years        In December       Greg Kroah Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project  which aims to put some Android drivers  patches and features back into the Linux kernel  starting in Linux           Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the     kernel  after many previous attempts at merger  The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes  to memory  the traditional suspend that Android uses   and to disk  hibernate  as it is known on the desktop        Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re base Android off the latest stable Linux versions            The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions  such as  system for the operating system itself  and  data for user data and application installations       In contrast to desktop Linux distributions  Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as  system are read only  However  root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android  which is used frequently by the open source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices  but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware       Android is a Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation       Google s open source chief Chris DiBona       and several journalists            Others  such as Google engineer Patrick Brady  say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix like Linux distribution sense  Android does not include the GNU C Library  it uses Bionic as an alternative C library  and some of other components typically found in Linux distributions       With the release of Android Oreo in       Google began to require that devices shipped with new SoCs had Linux kernel version     or newer  for security reasons  Existing devices upgraded to Oreo  and new products launched with older SoCs  were exempt from this rule             Software stack  Android s architecture diagram obsolete source On top of the Linux kernel  there are the middleware  libraries and APIs written in C  and application software running on an application framework which includes Java compatible libraries  Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of Android s other source code projects  Android uses Android Runtime  ART  as its runtime environment  introduced in version       which uses ahead of time  AOT  compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application  In Android      ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default  it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android            In versions no longer supported  until version     when ART took over  Android previously used Dalvik as a process virtual machine with trace based just in time  JIT  compilation to run Dalvik  dex code   Dalvik Executable   which is usually translated from the Java bytecode  Following the trace based JIT principle  in addition to interpreting the majority of application code  Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments   traces   each time an application is launched                 For its Java library  the Android platform uses a subset of the now discontinued Apache Harmony project       In December       Google announced that the next version of Android would switch to a Java implementation based on the OpenJDK project       Android s standard C library  Bionic  was developed by Google specifically for Android  as a derivation of the BSD s standard C library code  Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel  The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU C Library  glibc  or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint  and optimization for low frequency CPUs  At the same time  Bionic is licensed under the terms of the BSD licence  which Google finds more suitable for the Android s overall licensing model       Aiming for a different licensing model  toward the end of       Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL licensed BlueZ to the Apache licensed BlueDroid       Android does not have a native X Window System by default  nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries  This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android       until version r  of the Android Native Development Kit brought support for applications written completely in C or C         Libraries written in C may also be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the JNI       In current versions of Android   Toybox   a collection of command line utilities  mostly for use by apps  as Android does not provide a command line interface by default   is used  since the release of Marshmallow  replacing a similar  Toolbox  collection found in previous Android versions       Android has another operating system  Trusty OS  within it  as a part of  Trusty   software components supporting a Trusted Execution Environment  TEE  on mobile devices    Trusty and the Trusty API are subject to change       Applications for the Trusty OS can be written in C C    C   support is limited   and they have access to a small C library       All Trusty applications are single threaded  multithreading in Trusty userspace currently is unsupported       Third party application development is not supported in  the current version  and software running on the OS and processor for it  run the  DRM framework for protected content       There are many other uses for a TEE such as mobile payments  secure banking  full disk encryption  multi factor authentication  device reset protection  replay protected persistent storage  wireless display   cast   of protected content  secure PIN and fingerprint processing  and even malware detection         Open source community Android s source code is released by Google under an open source license  and its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open source code as a foundation for community driven projects  which deliver updates to older devices  add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems       These community developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer carrier channels  with a comparable level of quality       provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates  or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems  such as the HP TouchPad  Community releases often come pre rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor  such as the ability to overclock or over undervolt the device s processor       CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware       now discontinued and succeeded by LineageOS       There are  as of August       a handful of notable custom Android distributions  ROMs  of the latest Android version     Pie  which was released publicly in August       See List of custom Android distributions  Historically  device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third party firmware development  Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this       Moreover  modified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features  such as tethering  for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium  As a result  technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices  However  as community developed software has grown more popular  and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the  jailbreaking  of mobile devices       manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development  with some  including HTC       Motorola       Samsung           and Sony       providing support and encouraging development  As a result of this  over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders  similar to Nexus series of phones  although usually requiring that users waive their devices  warranties to do so       However  despite manufacturer acceptance  some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down  frustrating developers and customers        Device codenames Internally  Android identifies each supported device by its device codename  a short string       which may or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device  For example  the device codename of the Pixel smartphone is sailfish  The device codename is usually not visible to the end user  but is important for determining compatibility with modified Android versions  It is sometimes also mentioned in articles discussing a device  because it allows to distinguish different hardware variants of a device  even if the manufacturer offers them under the same name  The device codename is available to running applications under android os Build DEVICE        Security and privacy See also  Mobile security and WARRIOR PRIDE In       Google launched the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative to improve the security of Android            They also formed an Android security team        Scope of surveillance by public institutions As part of the broader      mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September      that the American and British intelligence agencies  the National Security Agency  NSA  and Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ   respectively  have access to the user data on iPhone  BlackBerry  and Android devices  They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information  including SMS  location  emails  and notes       In January       further reports revealed the intelligence agencies  capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds  which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons  GCHQ has  according to The Guardian  a wiki style guide of different apps and advertising networks  and the different data that can be siphoned from each       Later that week  the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations  and called upon the wider industry to do the same       The documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk       The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities comply with all relevant domestic and international laws  although the Guardian stated  the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information  especially for those outside the US  who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans        Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks  codenamed Vault   and dated from      to       detail the capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare  including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones  including Android              Common security threats Research from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware  where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user  Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device  or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties       Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially  however  Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons            and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users       Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare       and a survey conducted by F Secure showed that only      of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store       In August       Google announced that devices in the Google Nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches  Google also wrote that  Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or    months from last sale of the device via the Google Store                  The following October  researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that       of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support                 Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August      that  Android was originally designed  above all else  to be widely adopted  Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share  so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption        Now  though  Android has around       percent of the worldwide smartphone market making it not just the world s most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system  period  As such  security has become a big issue  Android still uses a software update chain of command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update  and it just doesn t work        Following news of Google s monthly schedule  some manufacturers  including Samsung and LG  promised to issue monthly security updates       but  as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February        instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models  And a bunch of broken promises        In a March      post on Google s Security Blog  Android security leads Adrian Ludwig and Mel Miller wrote that  More than     million devices from      manufacturers received a platform security update in       and that  Our carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates  releasing updates for over half of the top    devices worldwide in the last quarter of        They also wrote that  About half of devices in use at the end of      had not received a platform security update in the previous year   stating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security updates program for easier deployment by manufacturers       Furthermore  in a comment to TechCrunch  Ludwig stated that the wait time for security updates had been reduced from  six to nine weeks down to just a few days   with     of flagship devices in North America being up to date on security at the end of            Patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower priced devices            However  the open source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses  For example  Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their Open Kernel Labs acquisition to rebuild Jelly Bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the  Knox  project            Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi Fi access points  encountered as phone users move around  to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points  These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones  allowing them to run apps like Foursquare  Google Latitude  Facebook Places  and to deliver location based ads       Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid       an academic research funded project  can  in some cases  detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers       In       Norwegian security firm Promon has unearthed a serious Android security hole which can be exploited including to steal login credential  access messages  and track location  which the vulnerability could be found in all versions of Android  including Android     The vulnerability came by exploiting a bug in multitasking system and enabling malicious app to overlay legitimate apps with fake login screens that the users did not aware when handing security credentials  The users can also be tricked into granting additional permissions to the malicious apps  which later enable the apps to perform various nefarious activities  including interception of texts or calls and bank robbery       Avast Threat Labs also discovered that many pre installed apps of new Android device that containing dangerous malware and adware on several hundred different Android device models and versions  Some of the preinstalled malwares can commit ad fraud  or even take over its host device            In       the Which  watchdog reported that more than a billion Android devices released in      or earlier  which is     of Android devices worldwide  are at risk of being hacked  This conclusion stemmed from the fact that no security updates were issued for the Android versions below     in       Which  collaborated with the AV Comparatives anti virus lab to infect five phone models with malware  and it succeeded in each case  Google refused to comment on the watchdog s speculations       On August          Twitter published a blog urging its users to update their applications to the latest version with regards to a security concern that allowed others to access direct messages  A hacker could easily use the  Android system permissions  to fetch the account credentials in order to do so  The security issue is only with Android OS    Android Oreo  and Android OS    Android Pie   Twitter confirmed that updating the app will restrict such practices        Technical security features Android applications run in a sandbox  an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system s resources  unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed  however this may not be possible for pre installed apps  It is not possible  for example  to turn off the microphone access of the pre installed camera app without disabling the camera completely  This is valid also in Android versions   and         Since February       Google has used its Google Bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan apps available in the Google Play store            A  Verify Apps  feature was introduced in November       as part of the Android      Jelly Bean  operating system version  to scan all apps  both from Google Play and from third party sources  for malicious behaviour       Originally only doing so during installation  Verify Apps received an update in      to  constantly  scan apps  and in      the feature was made visible to users through a menu in Settings            Before installing an application  the Google Play store displays a list of the requirements an app needs to function  After reviewing these permissions  the user can choose to accept or refuse them  installing the application only if they accept       In Android      Marshmallow   the permissions system was changed  apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time  An opt in system is used instead  in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions to an app when they are needed for the first time  Applications remember the grants  which can be revoked by the user at any time  Pre installed apps  however  are not always part of this approach  In some cases it may not be possible to deny certain permissions to pre installed apps  nor be possible to disable them  The Google Play Services app cannot be uninstalled  nor disabled  Any force stop attempt  result in the app restarting itself            The new permissions model is used only by applications developed for Marshmallow using its software development kit  SDK   and older apps will continue to use the previous all or nothing approach  Permissions can still be revoked for those apps  though this might prevent them from working properly  and a warning is displayed to that effect            In September       Jason Nova of Android Authority reported on a study by the German security company Fraunhofer AISEC in antivirus software and malware threats on Android  Nova wrote that  The Android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them  this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe  By not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation  applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe  If then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious  the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirus  jurisdiction   The study by Fraunhofer AISEC  examining antivirus software from Avast  AVG  Bitdefender  ESET  F Secure  Kaspersky  Lookout  McAfee  formerly Intel Security   Norton  Sophos  and Trend Micro  revealed that  the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks   and that  the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity        In August       Google announced Android Device Manager  renamed Find My Device in May                  a service that allows users to remotely track  locate  and wipe their Android device            with an Android app for the service released in December            In December       Google introduced a Trusted Contacts app  letting users request location tracking of loved ones during emergencies            On October         Google announced new Google Play store requirements to combat over sharing of potentially sensitive information  including call and text logs  The issue stems from the fact that many apps request permissions to access user s personal information  even if this information is not needed for the app to function  and some users unquestionably grant these permissions  Alternatively  a permission might be listed in the app manifest as required  as opposed to optional  and app would not install unless user grants the permission  user can withdraw any  even required  permission from any app in the device settings after app installation  but few users do this  Google promised to work with developers and create exceptions if their apps require Phone or SMS permissions for  core app functionality   The new policies enforcement started on January             days after policy announcement on October          Furthermore  Google announced a new  target API level requirement   targetSdkVersion in manifest  at least Android      API level     for all new apps and app updates  The API level requirement might combat practice of app developers bypassing some permission screens by specifying early Android versions that had more coarse permission model             Licensing The source code for Android is open source  it is developed in private by Google  with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released  Google publishes most of the code  including network and telephony stacks  under the non copyleft Apache License version      which allows modification and redistribution            The license does not grant rights to the  Android  trademark  so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts  Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version    developed by the Open Handset Alliance  with the source code publicly available at all times       The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet only     Honeycomb release  The reason  according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post  was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom       and they did not want third parties creating a  really bad user experience  by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets       Only the base Android operating system  including some applications  is open source software  whereas most Android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software  such as Google Mobile Services  which includes applications such as Google Play Store  Google Search  and Google Play Services    a software layer that provides APIs for the integration with Google provided services  among others  These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers  and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements       Custom  certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers  such as Samsung Experience  may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system       With the advent of the Google Pixel line of devices  Google itself has also made specific Android features timed or permanent exclusives to the Pixel series            There may also be  binary blob  drivers required for certain hardware components in the device            The best known fully open source Android services are the LineageOS distribution and MicroG which acts as an open source replacement of Google Play Services  Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant  because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary  and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or uninstall applications and  as a result  invite non free software  In both cases  the use of closed source software causes the system to become vulnerable to backdoors            It has been argued that because developers often require to purchase the Google brand Android license  this has turned the theoretically open system into a freemium service           Leverage over manufacturers Google licenses their Google Mobile Services software  along with the Android trademarks  only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google s compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document       Thus  forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google s non free components  stay incompatible with applications that require them  and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store       A prominent example of such an Android fork is Amazon s Fire OS  which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets  and oriented toward Amazon services       The shipment of Android devices without GMS is also common in mainland China  as Google does not do business there                 In       Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display a prominent  Powered by Android  logo on their boot screens       Google has also enforced preferential bundling and placement of Google Mobile Services on devices  including mandated bundling of the entire main suite of Google applications  and that shortcuts to Google Search and the Play Store app must be present on or near the main home screen page in its default configuration       In March       it was reported that Google had begun to block  uncertified  Android devices from using Google Mobile Services software  and display a warning indicating that  the device manufacturer has preloaded Google apps and services without certification from Google   Users of custom ROMs can register their device ID to their Google account to remove this block       Some stock applications and components in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android  such as Search  Music  Calendar  and the location API  were abandoned by Google in favor of non free replacements distributed through Play Store  Google Search  Google Play Music  and Google Calendar  and Google Play Services  which are no longer open source  Moreover  open source variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their non free versions                      These measures are likely intended to discourage forks and encourage commercial licensing in line with Google requirements  as the majority of the operating system s core functionality is dependent on proprietary components licensed exclusively by Google  and it would take significant development resources to develop an alternative suite of software and APIs to replicate or replace them  Apps that do not use Google components would also be at a functional disadvantage  as they can only use APIs contained within the OS itself  In turn  third party apps may have dependencies on Google Play Services       Members of the Open Handset Alliance  which include the majority of Android OEMs  are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on forks of the OS            in       Acer Inc  was forced by Google to halt production on a device powered by Alibaba Group s Aliyun OS with threats of removal from the OHA  as Google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of Android  Alibaba Group defended the allegations  arguing that the OS was a distinct platform from Android  primarily using HTML  apps   but incorporated portions of Android s platform to allow backwards compatibility with third party Android software  Indeed  the devices did ship with an application store which offered Android apps  however  the majority of them were pirated                  Reception Android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in       Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance  it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android       The idea of an open source  Linux based development platform sparked interest       but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market  such as Nokia and Microsoft  and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development       These established players were skeptical  Nokia was quoted as saying  we don t see this as a threat   and a member of Microsoft s Windows Mobile team stated  I don t understand the impact that they are going to have        Since then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system           and  one of the fastest mobile experiences available        Reviewers have highlighted the open source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths  allowing companies such as Nokia  Nokia X family        Amazon  Kindle Fire   Barnes   Noble  Nook   Ouya  Baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of Android  As a result  it has been described by technology website Ars Technica as  practically the default operating system for launching new hardware  for companies without their own mobile platforms       This openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user  Android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non Google app stores and third party websites  These have been cited as among the main advantages of Android phones over others            Despite Android s popularity  including an activation rate three times that of iOS  there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected       The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non Google apps and services    Amazon s Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS  a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google s proprietary components  and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store       In       in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand  Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen       Android has suffered from  fragmentation        a situation where the variety of Android devices  in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them  makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less  For example  according to data from OpenSignal in July       there were        models of Android device  numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use  while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS       Critics such as Apple Insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android s growth through large volumes of low end  budget priced devices running older versions of Android  They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the  lowest common denominator  to reach as many users as possible  who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices       However  OpenSignal  who develops both Android and iOS apps  concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier  Android s wider global reach also increases the potential reward        Market share Main article  Usage share of operating systems Research company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of       that Android had a      share of worldwide smartphone shipments       By May       Android had a     worldwide smartphone market share  overtaking Windows Mobile       whilst in the US Android held a     share  overtaking iPhone OS       By the fourth quarter of       its worldwide share had grown to     of the market becoming the top selling smartphone platform       overtaking Symbian       In the US it became the top selling platform in April       overtaking BlackBerry OS with a       smartphone share  according to comScore       By the third quarter of       Gartner estimated that more than half         of the smartphone sales belonged to Android       By the third quarter of      Android had a     share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm IDC       In July       Google said that         Android devices were being activated every day       up from         per day in May       and more than     million devices had been activated      with      growth per week       In September           million devices had been activated with     million activations per day            In May       at Google I O  Sundar Pichai announced that     million Android devices had been activated       Android market share varies by location  In July        mobile subscribers aged      in the United States using Android were up to           and rose to     in China       During the third quarter of       Android s worldwide smartphone shipment market share was           with     million devices activated in total  In April       Android had     million activations per day       As of May      update      billion applications   apps   have been installed from the Google Play store       and by September       one billion Android devices have been activated       As of August      update   the Google Play store has over   million Android applications published           and as of May      update   apps have been downloaded more than    billion times       The operating system s success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so called  smartphone wars  between technology companies            Android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets  including the US  while  only in Japan was Apple on top   September November      numbers        At the end of       over     billion Android smartphones have been sold in the four years since                 making Android the most sold phone and tablet OS  Three billion Android smartphones are estimated to be sold by the end of       including previous years   According to Gartner research company  Android based devices outsold all contenders  every year since            In       it outsold Windows       or by     million                 As of      update   Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems      Since       devices running it also sell more than Windows  iOS and Mac OS X devices combined       According to StatCounter  which tracks only the use for browsing the web  Android is the most popular mobile operating system since August            Android is the most popular operating system for web browsing in India and several other countries  e g  virtually all of Asia  with Japan and North Korea exceptions   According to StatCounter  Android is most used on mobile in all African countries  and it stated  mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India  South Africa and Saudi Arabia        with virtually all countries in Africa having done so already  except for seven countries  including Egypt   such as Ethiopia and Kenya in which mobile  including tablets  usage is at         Android only  accounts for        of all use there             While Android phones in the Western world commonly include Google s proprietary add ons  such as Google Play  to the otherwise open source operating system  this is increasingly not the case in emerging markets   ABI Research claims that    million devices shipped globally with open source Android in the second quarter of         up from    million in the first quarter   depending on country  percent of phones estimated to be based only on AOSP source code  forgoing the Android trademark  Thailand        Philippines        Indonesia        India        Malaysia        Mexico        Brazil            According to a January      Gartner report   Android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in       and will continue to grow at a double digit pace in       with a    percent increase year over year   This made it the first time that any general purpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within a year  by reaching close to      billion end users in       Android shipped over four times more than iOS and OS X combined  and over three times more than Microsoft Windows  Gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to  reach two billion units in        including Android       Describing the statistics  Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times that  About one of every two computers sold today is running Android   It  has become Earth s dominant computing platform       According to a Statistica s estimate  Android smartphones had an installed base of     billion units in       which was     of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide            a  Android has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system and  since       the highest selling operating system overall                          with sales in            and           close to the installed base of all PCs       In the second quarter of       Android s share of the global smartphone shipment market was        a new record            This had grown to       worldwide market share by the third quarter of            leaving main competitor iOS with       market share       According to an April      StatCounter report  Android overtook Microsoft Windows to become the most popular operating system for total Internet usage            It has maintained the plurality since then       In September       Google announced that Android had     billion monthly active users            This changed to   billion monthly active users in May                  Adoption on tablets  The first generation Nexus   tablet  running Android     Jelly Bean Despite its success on smartphones  initially Android tablet adoption was slow       then later caught up with the iPad  in most countries  One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications  but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them            The content and app  ecosystem  proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets  Due to the lack of Android tablet specific applications in       early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill suited to larger screen sizes  whereas the dominance of Apple s iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet specific iOS applications            Despite app support in its infancy  a considerable number of Android tablets  like the Barnes   Noble Nook  alongside those using other operating systems  such as the HP TouchPad and BlackBerry PlayBook  were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad       InfoWorld has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a  Frankenphone business   a short term low investment opportunity by placing a smartphone optimized Android OS  before Android     Honeycomb for tablets was available  on a device while neglecting user interface  This approach  such as with the Dell Streak  failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets            Furthermore  several Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom were priced the same or higher than the iPad  which hurt sales  An exception was the Amazon Kindle Fire  which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon s ecosystem of applications and content            This began to change in       with the release of the affordable Nexus   and a push by Google for developers to write better tablet applications       According to International Data Corporation  shipments of Android powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q               Barnes   Noble Nook running Android As of the end of       over       million Android tablets had sold in three years since                 This made Android tablets the most sold type of tablet in       surpassing iPads in the second quarter of            According to StatCounter s web use statistics  as of      update   Android tablets represent the majority of tablet devices used in Africa        South America        while less than half elsewhere  e

where Android tablets are most used  e g  in Mexico       In March       Galen Gruman of InfoWorld stated that Android devices could be a  real part of your business      there s no longer a reason to keep Android at arm s length  It can now be as integral to your mobile portfolio as Apple s iOS devices are        A year earlier  Gruman had stated that Microsoft s own mobile Office apps were  better on iOS and Android  than on Microsoft s own Windows    devices         Platform information Main article  Android version history  Animation showing Easter eggs in Google s Android operating

easily be pirated       In a May      interview with Eurogamer  the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was     for their game Football Manager Handheld       However  not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue  for example  in July      the developers of the game Wind up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only      and most of the piracy came from China  where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play       In       Google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps  but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack  Google responded that the tool  especially its initial release  was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs  not as a finished piracy solution       Android  Jelly Bean  introduced the ability for paid applications to be encrypted  so that they may work only on the device for which they were purchased             Legal issues Further information  Smartphone patent wars and Patent troll The success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies  both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges   Patent lawsuit with Oracle Main article  Oracle v  Google On August           Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language       Oracle originally sought damages up to      billion       but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate       In response  Google submitted multiple lines of defense  counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle s patents or copyright  that Oracle s patents were invalid  and several other defenses  They said that Android s Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony  a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries  and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik       In May       the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle s patents  and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable            The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code       On May          the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling  ruling in Oracle s favor on the copyrightability issue  and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court            In December       Google announced that the next major release of Android  Android Nougat  would switch to OpenJDK  which is the official open source implementation of the Java platform  instead of using the now discontinued Apache Harmony project as its runtime  Code reflecting this change was also posted to the AOSP source repository       In its announcement  Google claimed this was part of an effort to create a  common code base  between Java on Android and other platforms       Google later admitted in a court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle  as its use of OpenJDK code is governed under the GNU General Public License  GPL  with a linking exception  and that  any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require a separate analysis of damages from earlier releases        In June       a United States federal court ruled in favor of Google  stating that its use of the APIs was fair use        Anti competitive challenges in Europe Main article  European Union vs  Google In       FairSearch  a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft  Oracle and others  filed a complaint regarding Android with the European Commission  alleging that its free of charge distribution model constituted anti competitive predatory pricing  The Free Software Foundation Europe  whose donors include Google  disputed the Fairsearch allegations       On April           the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations  arguing that its leverage over Android vendors  including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software  hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android  and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android  constituted anti competitive practices       In August       Google was fined US      million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service  FAS  under similar allegations by Yandex       The European Commission issued its decision on July           determining that Google had conducted three operations related to Android that were in violation of antitrust regulations  bundling Google s search and Chrome as part of Android  blocking phone manufacturers from using forked versions of Android  and establishing deals with phone manufacturers and network providers to exclusively bundle the Google search application on handsets  a practice Google ended by        The EU fined Google for      billion  about US   billion  and required the company to end this conduct within    days       Google filed its appeal of the ruling in October       though will not ask for any interim measures to delay the onset of conduct requirements       On October           Google announced that it would change its distribution model for Google Mobile Services in the EU  since part of its revenues streams for Android which came through use of Google Search and Chrome were now prohibited by the EU s ruling  While the core Android system remains free  OEMs in Europe would be required to purchase a paid license to the core suite of Google applications  such as Gmail  Google Maps and the Google Play Store  Google Search will be licensed separately  with an option to include Google Chrome at no additional cost atop Search  European OEMs can bundle third party alternatives on phones and devices sold to customers  if they so choose  OEMs will no longer be barred from selling any device running incompatible versions of Android in Europe        Others In addition to lawsuits against Google directly  various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices  with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market       Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement  with Apple s ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high profile case  In January       Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers  whose products account for     percent of all Android smartphones  sold in the US      and     of the worldwide revenue for Android devices       These include Samsung and HTC       Samsung s patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft s Windows Phone operating system       Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses  requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees  while at the same time helping to promote its software lines            Google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the United States  accusing Apple  Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation  rather than innovating and competing with better products and services       In August       Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US      billion  which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android  since Motorola Mobility held more than        patents            In December       Google bought over a thousand patents from IBM       Turkey s competition authority investigations about default search engine in Android  started in       led to a US      million fine in September      and a fine of      percent of Google s revenue per day in November      when Google didn t meet the requirements       In December       Google stopped issuing licenses for new Android phone models sold in Turkey        Other uses  Ouya  a video game console which runs Android Google has developed several variations of Android for specific use cases  including Android Wear  later renamed Wear OS  for wearable devices such as wrist watches            Android TV for televisions            and Android Things for smart devices and Internet of things            Additionally  by providing infrastructure that combines dedicated hardware and dedicated applications running on regular Android  Google have opened up the platform for its use in particular usage scenarios  such as Android Auto for cars            and Daydream  a Virtual Reality platform       The open and customizable nature of Android allows device makers to use it on other electronics as well  including laptops  netbooks            and desktop computers       cameras       headphones       home automation systems  game consoles       media players       satellites       routers       printers       payment terminals       automated teller machines       and robots       Additionally  Android has been installed and run on a variety of less technical objects  including calculators       single board computers       feature phones       electronic dictionaries       alarm clocks       refrigerators       landline telephones       coffee machines       bicycles       and mirrors       Ouya  a

Motors  Hyundai  and Honda  and Nvidia  which aims to produce Android based in car entertainment systems for automobiles    bringing  the best of Android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way         Android comes preinstalled on a few laptops  a similar functionality of running Android applications is also available in Google s Chrome OS  and can also be installed on personal computers by end users       On those platforms Android provides additional functionality for physical keyboards      and mice  together with the  Alt Tab  key combination for switching applications quickly with a keyboard  In December       one reviewer commented that Android s notification system is  vastly more complete and robust than in most environments  and that Android is  absolutely usable  as one s primary desktop operating system       In October       The Wall Street Journal reported that Android will serve as Google s future main laptop operating system  with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by                 Google s Sundar Pichai  who led the development of Android  explained that  mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today        Also  back in       Google co founder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would  likely converge over time        Lockheimer  who replaced Pichai as head of Android and Chrome OS  responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that  While we ve been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems  there s no plan to phase out Chrome OS  which has  guaranteed auto updates for five years        That is unlike Android where support is shorter with  EOL dates  being    at least   years  into the future  for Android tablets for education        At Google I O in May       Google announced Daydream  a virtual reality platform that relies on a smartphone and provides VR capabilities through a virtual reality headset and controller designed by Google itself       The platform is built into Android starting with Android Nougat  differentiating from standalone support for VR capabilities  The software is available for developers

  Blok confirmed in an interview that she independently developed it and made it open source  The robot design was initially not presented to Google  but it quickly became commonplace in the Android development team  with various variations of it created by the developers there who liked the figure  as it was free under a Creative Commons license            Its popularity amongst the development team eventually led to Google adopting it as an official icon as part of the Android logo when it launched to consumers in        See also   Free and open source software portal Computer programming
