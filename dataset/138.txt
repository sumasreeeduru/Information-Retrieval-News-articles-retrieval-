recording project s creative and technical leader  commanding studio time and coaching artists  and in popular genres typically creates the song s very sound and structure           The record producer  or simply the producer  is likened to a film director        The executive producer  on the other hand  enables the recording project through entrepreneurship  Varying by project  the producer may also choose all of the artists     or openly perform vocals with them     If employing only synthesized or sampled instrumentation  the producer may be the sole artist     Conversely  some artists do their own production     And some producers are their own engineers     operating the technology across the project  preproduction  recording  mixing  and mastering  Record producers  precursors were  A R men   who likewise could blend entrepreneurial  creative  and technical roles     but often exercised scant creative influence     as record production still focused  into the     s  on simply improving the record s sonic match to the artists  own live performance     Advances in recording technology  especially the     s advent of tape recording which Les Paul promptly innovated further to develop multitrack recording    and the     s rise of electronic instruments  turned record production into a specialty     In popular music  then  producers like George Martin  Phil Spector and Brian Eno led its evolution into its present use of elaborate techniques and unrealistic sounds  creating songs impossible to originate live        After the     s  production s move from analog to digital further expanded possibilities     By now  DAWS  or digital audio workstations  like Logic Pro and Pro Tools  turn an ordinary computer into a production console         whereby a solitary novice can become a skilled producer in a thrifty home studio          In the     s  efforts began to increase the prevalence of producers and engineers who are women  heavily outnumbered by men and prominently accoladed only in classical music            Music producer Sir George Martin  best known for his work with The Beatles  pictured with members George Harrison  Sir Paul

project  the creation of a music recording may be split across three specialists  the executive producer  who oversees business partnerships and financing  the vocal producer or vocal arranger  who aids vocal performance via expert critique and coaching of vocal technique  and the record producer or music producer  who  often called simply the producer  directs the overall creative process of recording the song in its final mix   The record producer s roles include  but may exceed  gathering ideas  composing music  choosing session musicians  proposing changes to song arrangements  coaching the performers  controlling sessions  supervising the audio mixing  and  in some cases  supervising the audio mastering  As to qualifying for a Grammy nomination  the Recording Academy defines a producer    The person who has overall creative and technical control of the entire recording project  and the individual recording sessions that are part of that project  He or she is present in the recording studio or at the location recording and works directly with the artist and engineer  The producer makes creative and aesthetic decisions that realize both the artist s and label s goals in the creation of musical content  Other duties include  but are not limited to  keeping budgets and schedules  adhering to deadlines  hiring musicians  singers  studios and engineers  overseeing other staffing needs and editing  Classical projects    The producer often selects and collaborates with a mixing engineer  who focuses on the especially technological aspects of the recording process  namely  operating the electronic equipment and blending the raw  recorded tracks of the chosen performances  whether vocal or instrumental  into a   mix    either stereo or surround sound  Then a mastering engineer further adjusts this recording for distribution on the chosen media  A producer may work on only one or two songs or on an artist s entire album  helping develop the album s overall vision  The record producers may also take on the role of executive producer  managing the budget  schedules  contracts  and negotiations   Historical developments edit  A R men edit   Artist and Repertoire  In the     s  the record industry began by simply having the artist perform at a phonograph      In       the trade journal Talking Machine World  covering the phonography and record industry  reported that Eddie King  Victor Records  manager of the  New York artist and repertoire department   had planned a set of recordings in Los Angeles      Later  folklorist Archie Green called this perhaps the earliest printed use of A R man      Actually  it says neither  A R man  nor even  A R   an initialism perhaps coined by Billboard magazine in       and entering wide use in the late     s      In the     s and     s  A R executives  like Ben Selvin at Columbia Records  Nathaniel Shilkret at Victor Records  and Bob Haring at Brunswick Records  supervising recording and often leading session orchestras  became the precursors of record producers     During the     s  American record labels increasingly opened official A R departments  whose roles included supervision of recording      Meanwhile  recording studios owned independently  not by major record labels  opened  helping originate record producer as a specialty  citation needed  But despite a tradition of some A R men writing music  record production remained  strictly  merely the manufacturing of record discs      Record producers edit  After World War II  pioneering A R managers who transitioned influentially to record production as now understood  while sometimes owning independent labels  include J  Mayo Williams and John Hammond     Upon moving from Columbia Records to Mercury Records  Hammond appointed Mitch Miller to lead Mercury s popular recordings in New York     Miller then produced country pop crossover hits by Patti Page and by Frankie Laine  moved from Mercury to Columbia  and became a leading A R man of the     s     During the decade  A R executives increasingly directed songs  sonic signatures  although many still simply teamed singers with musicians  while yet others exercised virtually no creative influence     The term record producer in its current meaning the creative director of song production appearing in a      issue of Billboard magazine  became widespread in the     s     Still  a formal distinction was elusive for some time more     A R managers might still be creative directors  like William  Mickey  Stevenson  hired by Berry Gordy  at the Motown record label       Tape recording edit  In       the American market gained audio recording onto magnetic tape      At the record industry s     s dawn  rather  recording was done by phonograph  etching the sonic waveform vertically into a cylinder      By the     s  a gramophone etched it laterally across a disc      Constrained in tonal range  whether bass or treble  and in dynamic range  records made a grand  concert piano sound like a small  upright piano  and maximal duration was four and a half minutes          Selections and performance were often altered accordingly      And playing this disc the wax master destroyed it      The finality often caused anxiety that restrained performance to prevent error      In the     s  during World War II  the Germans refined audio recording onto magnetic tape uncapping recording duration and allowing immediate playback  rerecording  and editing     a technology that premised emergence of record producers in their current roles       Multitrack recording edit  Early in the recording industry  a record was attained by simply having all of the artists perform together live in one take      In          by recording a musical element while playing a previously recorded record  Les Paul developed a recording technique called  sound on sound       By this  the final recording could be built piece by piece and tailored  effecting an editing process      In one case  Paul produced a song via     recorded discs      But  besides the tedium of this process  it serially degraded the sound quality of previously recorded elements  rerecorded as ambient sound      Yet in       Paul adopted tape recording  enabling truly multitrack recording by a new technique   overdubbing       To enable overdubbing  Paul revised the tape recorder itself by adding a second playback head  and terming it the preview head     Joining the preexisting recording head  erase head  and playback head  the preview head allows the artist to hear the extant recording over headphones playing it in synchrony   in sync   with the present performance being recorded alone on an isolated track     This isolation of multiple tracks enables countless mixing possibilities  Producers began recording initially only the  bed tracks  the rhythm section  including the bassline  drums  and rhythm guitar whereas vocals and instrument solos could be added later  A horn section  for example  could record a week later  and a string section another week later  A singer could perform her own backup vocals  or a guitarist could play    layers   Electronic instruments edit   Phil Spector producing Modern Folk Quartet      Across the     s  popular music increasingly switched from acoustic instruments  like piano  upright bass  acoustic guitar  and brass instruments  to electronic instruments  like electric guitars  keyboards  and synthesizers  employing instrument amplifiers and speakers  These could mimic acoustic instruments or create utterly new sounds  Soon  by combining the capabilities of tape  multitrack recording  and electronic instruments  producers like Phil Spector  George Martin  and Joe Meek rendered sounds unattainable live     Similarly  in jazz fusion  Teo Macero  producing Miles Davis s      album Bitches Brew  spliced sections of extensive improvisation sessions  Performer producer edit  In the     s  rock acts like the Beatles  the Rolling Stones      and the Kinks produced some of their own songs  although many such songs are officially credited to specialist producers  citation needed   Yet especially influential was the Beach Boys  whose band leader Brian Wilson took over from his father Murry within a couple of years after the band s commercial breakthrough  By       Wilson had taken Spector s techniques to unseen sophistication  citation needed   Wilson alone produced all Beach Boy recordings between      and       citation needed   Using multiple studios and multiple attempts of instrumental and vocal tracks  Wilson selected the best combinations of performance and audio quality  and used tape editing to assemble a composite performance  citation needed   Digital production edit  The     s advent of digital processes and formats rapidly replaced analog processes and formats  namely  tape and vinyl  Although recording onto quality tape  at least half an inch wide and traveling    inches per second  had limited  tape hiss  to silent sections  digital s higher signal to noise ratio  SNR  abolished it      Digital also imparted to the music a perceived  pristine  sound quality  if also a loss of analog recordings  perceived  warm  quality and bass better rounded      Yet whereas editing tape media requires physically locating the target audio on the ribbon  cutting there  and splicing pieces  editing digital media offers inarguable advantages in ease  efficiency  and possibilities  In the     s  digital production reached affordable home computers via production software  By now  recording and mixing are often centralized in DAWs  digital audio workstations for example  Pro Tools  Logic Pro  Ableton  Cubase  Reason  and FL Studio for which plugins  by third parties  effect virtual studio technology     DAWs fairly standard in the industry are Logic Pro and Pro Tools      Physical devices involved include the main mixer  MIDI controllers to communicate among equipment  the recording device itself  and perhaps effects gear that is outboard  Yet literal recording is sometimes still analog  onto tape  whereupon the raw recording is converted to a digital signal for processing and editing  as some producers still find audio advantages to recording onto tape      Conventionally  tape is more forgiving of overmodulation  whereby dynamic peaks exceed the maximal recordable signal level  tape s limitation  a physical property  is magnetic capacity  which tapers offs  smoothing the overmodulated waveform even at a signal nearly    decibels too  hot   whereas a digital recording is ruined by harsh distortion of  clipping  at any overshoot      In digital recording  however  a recent advancement     bit float  enables DAWs to undo clipping      Still  some criticize digital instruments and workflows for excess automation  allegedly impairing creative or sonic control      In any case  as production technology has drastically changed  so have the knowledge demands      although DAWs enables novices  even teenagers at home  to learn production independently      Some have attained professional competence before ever working with an artist        Brian Wilson at a mixing board in Brother Studios       Women in producing edit   Mixing consoleAmong record producers female  Sylvia Moy was the first at Motown  Gail Davies the first on Nashville s Music Row  and Ethel Gabriel  with RCA  the first at a major record label  Lillian McMurry  owning Trumpet Records  produced influential blues records  Meanwhile  Wilma Cozart Fine produced hundreds of records for Mercury Records  classical division  For classical production  three women have won Grammy awards  and Judith Sherman s      win was her fifth      Yet in nonclassical  no woman has won Producer of the Year  awarded since           After Lauren Christy s      nomination  Linda Perry s      nomination was the next for a woman      On why no woman had ever won it  Perry commented   I just don t think there are that many women interested       Across the decades  many female artists have produced their own music      For instance  artists Kate Bush  Madonna  Janet Jackson  Beyonc   Taylor Swift  and Lorde have produced or coproduced          Still  among specialists  despite some prominent women  including Missy Elliott in hip hop and Sylvia Massy in rock  the vast majority have been men      Early in the     s  asked for insights that she herself had gleaned as a woman who has specialized successfully in the industry  Wendy Page remarked   The difficulties are usually very short lived  Once people realize that you can do your job  sexism tends to lower its ugly head       Still  when tasked to explain her profession s sex disparity  Page partly reasoned that record labels  dominated by men  have been  she said   mistrustful of giving a woman the reins of an immense  creative project like making a record       Ultimately  the reasons are multiple and not fully clear  although prominently proposed factors include types of sexism and scarcity of female role models in the profession      In January       a research team led by Stacy L  Smith  founder and director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative      based in the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism      issued a report      estimating that in the prior several years  about    of popular songs  producers were female      Also that month  Billboard magazine queried   Where all the female music producers       Upon the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative s second annual report  released in February           its department at USC reported        saw an outcry from artists  executives and other music industry professionals over the lack of women in music  and  the plight of women in music   where women were allegedly being  stereotyped  sexualized  and shut out       Also in February       the Recording Academy s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion announced an initiative whereby over     artists and producers ranging from Cardi B and Taylor Swift to Maroon   and Quincy Jones agreed to consider at least two women for each producer or engineer position      The academy s website  Grammy com  announced   This initiative is the first step in a broader effort to improve those numbers and increase
