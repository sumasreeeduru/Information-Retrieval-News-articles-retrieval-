Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection  organization  analysis  interpretation and presentation of data           In applying statistics to a scientific  industrial  or social problem  it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied  Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as  all people living in a country  or  every atom composing a crystal   Statistics deals with every aspect of data  including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments     For a list of terms and topics  see the glossary of probability and statistics  When census data cannot be collected  statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples  Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole  An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study  manipulating the system  and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements  In contrast  an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation  Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis  descriptive statistics  which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation  and inferential statistics  which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation  e g   observational errors  sampling variation      Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution  sample or population   central tendency  or location  seeks to characterize the distribution s central or typical value  while dispersion  or variability  characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other  Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory  which deals with the analysis of random phenomena  A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to test of the relationship between two statistical data sets  or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model  A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets  and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets  Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false  given the data that are used in the test  Working from a null hypothesis  two basic forms of error are recognized  Type I errors  null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a  false positive   and Type II errors  null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual relationship between populations is missed giving a  false negative       Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework  ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis  citation needed  Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error  Many of these errors are classified as random  noise  or systematic  bias   but other types of errors  e g   blunder  such as when an analyst reports incorrect units  can also occur  The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems  The earliest writings on probability and statistics  statistical methods drawing from probability theory  date back to Arab mathematicians and cryptographers  notably Al Khalil              and Al Kindi                  In the   th century  statistics also started to draw heavily from calculus  In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software       Contents    Introduction      Mathematical statistics     History   Statistical data      Data

collection  analysis  interpretation or explanation  and presentation of data      or as a branch of mathematics      Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics  While many scientific investigations make use of data  statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty          In applying statistics to a problem  it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied  Populations can be diverse topics such as  all people living in a country  or  every atom composing a crystal   Ideally  statisticians compile data about the entire population  an operation called census   This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes  Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data  Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data  like income   while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data  like education   When a census is not feasible  a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied  Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined  data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting  Again  descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data  However  drawing the sample contains an element of randomness  hence  the numerical descriptors from the sample are also prone to uncertainty  To draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population  inferential statistics is needed  It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented while accounting for randomness  These inferences may take the form of answering yes no questions about the data  hypothesis testing   estimating numerical characteristics of the data  estimation   describing associations within the data  correlation   and modeling relationships within the data  for example  using regression analysis    Inference can extend to forecasting  prediction  and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied  It can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data  and data mining   Mathematical statistics edit  Main article  Mathematical statistics Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics  Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis  linear algebra  stochastic analysis  differential equations  and measure theoretic probability theory           History edit   Gerolamo Cardano  a pioneer on the mathematics of probability  Main articles  History of statistics and Founders of statistics The earliest writings on probability and statistics date back to Arab mathematicians and cryptographers  during the Islamic Golden Age between the  th and   th centuries  Al Khalil           wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages  which contains the first use of permutations and combinations  to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels     The earliest book on statistics is the  th century treatise Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages  written by Arab scholar Al Kindi            In his book  Al Kindi gave a detailed description of how to use statistics and frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages  This text laid the foundations for statistics and cryptanalysis        Al Kindi also made the earliest known use of statistical inference  while he and later Arab cryptographers developed the early statistical methods for decoding encrypted messages  Ibn Adlan             later made an important contribution  on the use of sample size in frequency analysis     The earliest European writing on statistics dates back to       with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt      Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data  hence its stat  etymology  The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early   th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general  Today  statistics is widely employed in government  business  and natural and social sciences  The mathematical foundations of modern statistics were laid in the   th century with the development of the probability theory by Gerolamo Cardano  Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat  Mathematical probability theory arose from the study of games of chance  although the concept of probability was already examined in medieval law and by philosophers such as Juan Caramuel      The method of least squares was first described by Adrien Marie Legendre in         Karl Pearson  a founder of mathematical statistics  The modern field of statistics emerged in the late   th and early   th century in three stages      The first wave  at the turn of the century  was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson  who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis  not just in science  but in industry and politics as well  Galton s contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation  correlation  regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics height  weight  eyelash length among others      Pearson developed the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient  defined as a product moment      the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution  among many other things      Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics  then called biometry   and the latter founded the world s first university statistics department at University College London      Ronald Fisher coined the term null hypothesis during the Lady tasting tea experiment  which  is never proved or established  but is possibly disproved  in the course of experimentation           The second wave of the     s and   s was initiated by William Sealy Gosset  and reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald Fisher  who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world  Fisher s most important publications were his      seminal paper The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance  which was the first to use the statistical term  variance   his classic      work Statistical Methods for Research Workers and his      The Design of Experiments              where he developed rigorous design of experiments models  He originated the concepts of sufficiency  ancillary statistics  Fisher s linear discriminator and Fisher information      In his      book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection  he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as Fisher s principle      which A  W  F  Edwards called  probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology   and Fisherian runaway                          a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway affect found in evolution  The final wave  which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments  emerged from the collaborative work between Egon Pearson and Jerzy Neyman in the     s  They introduced the concepts of  Type II  error  power of a test and confidence intervals  Jerzy Neyman in      showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive  quota  sampling      Today  statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making  for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology  The use of modern computers has expedited large scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually  Statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data       Statistical data edit  Main article  Statistical data Data collection edit  Sampling edit  When full census data cannot be collected  statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples  Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models  The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid     s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance      To use a sample as a guide to an entire population  it is important that it truly represents the overall population  Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole  A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative  Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures  There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study  strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population  Sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory  Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and  more generally  the properties of statistical procedures  The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method  The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is  roughly  that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples  Statistical inference  however  moves in the opposite direction inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population   Experimental and observational studies edit  A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality  and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables  There are two major types of causal statistical studies  experimental studies and observational studies  In both types of studies  the effect of differences of an independent variable  or variables  on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed  The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted  Each can be very effective  An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study  manipulating the system  and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements  In contrast  an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation  Instead  data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated  While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies  they are also applied to other kinds of data like natural experiments and observational studies     for which a statistician would use a modified  more structured estimation method  e g   Difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables  among many others  that produce consistent estimators   Experiments edit  The basic steps of a statistical experiment are   Planning the research  including finding the number of replicates of the study  using the following information   preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects  alternative hypotheses  and the estimated experimental variability  Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary  Statisticians recommend that experiments compare  at least  one new treatment with a standard treatment or control  to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects  Design of experiments  using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables  and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error  At this stage  the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data  Performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol  Further examining the data set in secondary analyses  to suggest new hypotheses for future study  Documenting and presenting the results of the study  Experiments on human behavior have special concerns  The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company  The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers  The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant  then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity  It turned out that productivity indeed improved  under the experimental conditions   However  the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures  specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness  The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome  in this case  worker productivity  changed due to observation itself  Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed       Observational study edit  An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer  This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis  In this case  the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non smokers  perhaps through a cohort study  and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group      A case control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest  e g  lung cancer  are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected   Types of data edit  Main articles  Statistical data type and Levels of measurement Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement  The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal  ordinal  interval  and ratio scales  Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values  and permit any one to one  injective  transformation  Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values  but have a meaningful order to those values  and permit any order preserving transformation  Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined  but the zero value is arbitrary  as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit   and permit any linear transformation  Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined  and permit any rescaling transformation  Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically  sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables  whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables  which can be either discrete or continuous  due to their numerical nature  Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science  in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type  polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type  and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation  But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented  Other categorizations have been proposed  For example  Mosteller and Tukey            distinguished grades  ranks  counted fractions  counts  amounts  and balances  Nelder            described continuous counts  continuous ratios  count ratios  and categorical modes of data   See also  Chrisman             van den Berg              The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions   The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations  Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer           Statistical methods edit  Descriptive statistics edit  Main article  Descriptive statistics A descriptive statistic  in the count noun sense  is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information      while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics  Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics  or inductive statistics   in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample  rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent   Inferential statistics edit  Main article  Statistical inference Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution      Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population  for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates   It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population  Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics  Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data  and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population   Terminology and theory of inferential statistics edit  Statistics  estimators and pivotal quantities edit  Consider independent identically distributed  IID  random variables with a given probability distribution  standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these IID variables      The population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters  A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample  but not a function of unknown parameters  The probability distribution of the statistic  though  may have unknown parameters  Consider now a function of the unknown parameter  an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function  Commonly used estimators include sample mean  unbiased sample variance and sample covariance  A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter  but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot  Widely used pivots include the z score  the chi square statistic and Student s t value  Between two estimators of a given parameter  the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient  Furthermore  an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated  and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter  Other desirable properties for estimators include  UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated  this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency  and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter  This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation  several methods have been proposed  the method of moments  the maximum likelihood method  the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations   Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis edit  Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually  but not necessarily  that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time          The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial  The null hypothesis  H   asserts that the defendant is innocent  whereas the alternative hypothesis  H   asserts that the defendant is guilty  The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt  The H   status quo  stands in opposition to H  and is maintained unless H  is supported by evidence  beyond a reasonable doubt   However   failure to reject H   in this case does not imply innocence  but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict  So the jury does not necessarily accept H  but fails to reject H   While one can not  prove  a null hypothesis  one can test how close it is to being true with a power test  which tests for type II errors  What statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis   Error edit  Working from a null hypothesis  two basic forms of error are recognized   Type I errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a  false positive   Type II errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a  false negative   Standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value  such as the sample or population mean  while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean  A statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value  a residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample  also called prediction   Mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators  a widely used class of estimators  Root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error    A least squares fit  in red the points to be fitted  in blue the fitted line  Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares  and these are called  methods of least squares  in contrast to Least absolute deviations  The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors  while the former gives more weight to large errors  Residual sum of squares is also differentiable  which provides a handy property for doing regression  Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non linear least squares  Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term  disturbance or more simply noise  Both linear regression and non linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares  which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable  y axis  as a function of the independent variable  x axis  and the deviations  errors  noise  disturbances  from the estimated  fitted  curve  Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error   Many of these errors are classified as random  noise  or systematic  bias   but other types of errors  e g   blunder  such as when an analyst reports incorrect units  can also be important  The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems       Interval estimation edit  Main article  Interval estimation  Confidence intervals  the red line is true value for the mean in this example  the blue lines are random confidence intervals for     realizations  Most studies only sample part of a population  so results don t fully represent the whole population  Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value  Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population  Often they are expressed as     confidence intervals  Formally  a     confidence interval for a value is a range where  if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions  yielding a different dataset   the interval would include the true  population  value in     of all possible cases  This does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is      From the frequentist perspective  such a claim does not even make sense  as the true value is not a random variable   Either the true value is or is not within the given interval  However  it is true that  before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval  the probability is     that the yet to be calculated interval will cover the true value  at this point  the limits of the interval are yet to be observed random variables  One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics  this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by  probability   that is as a Bayesian probability  In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical  An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter  left sided interval or right sided interval   but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate  Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds   Significance edit  Main article  Statistical significance Statistics rarely give a simple Yes No type answer to the question under analysis  Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis  sometimes referred to as the p value     In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the test statistic  the critical region is the set of values to the right of the observed data point  observed value of the test statistic  and the p value is represented by the green area  The standard approach     is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis  A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis  The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true  statistical significance  and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn t belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true  The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false  Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms  For example  in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect  such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably  Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate  the p value is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis  This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p value is the probability  assuming the null hypothesis is true  of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic  Therefore  the smaller the p value  the lower the probability of committing type I error  Some problems are usually associated with this framework  See criticism of hypothesis testing    A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance  but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this  One response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the p value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted  The p value  however  does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies  A better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals  Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p values  they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it  Fallacy of the transposed conditional  aka prosecutor s fallacy  criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis  the null hypothesis  to be favored  since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result  An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference  although it requires establishing a prior probability      Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis  As everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size  and therefore under fat tails p values may be seriously mis computed  clarification needed  Examples edit  Some well known statistical tests and procedures are    Analysis of variance  ANOVA  Chi squared test Correlation Factor analysis Mann Whitney U Mean square weighted deviation  MSWD  Pearson product moment correlation coefficient Regression analysis Spearman s rank correlation coefficient Student s t test Time series analysis Conjoint Analysis  Exploratory data analysis edit  Main article  Exploratory data analysis Exploratory data analysis  EDA  is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics  often with visual methods  A statistical model can be used or not  but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task   Misuse edit  Main article  Misuse of statistics Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors  and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors  For instance  social policy  medical practice  and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics  Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied  the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise  The statistical significance of a trend in the data which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance  The set of basic statistical skills  and skepticism  that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy  There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all too frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter      A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation   There are three kinds of lies  lies  damned lies  and statistics   Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional  and the book How to Lie with Statistics     outlines a range of considerations  In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics  reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted  e g  Warne  Lazo  Ramos  and Ritter              Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias      Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are  often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias      Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand  and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs      Unfortunately  most people do not look for bias or errors  so they are not noticed  Thus  people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented      To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate  the sample taken must be representative of the whole      According to Huff   The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by  bias     allow yourself some degree of skepticism       To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case       Who says so   Does he she have an axe to grind   How does he she know   Does he she have the resources to know the facts   What s missing   Does he she give us a complete picture   Did someone change the subject   Does he she offer us the right answer to the wrong problem   Does it make sense   Is his her conclusion logical and consistent with what we already know    The confounding variable problem  X and Y may be correlated  not because there is causal relationship between them  but because both depend on a third variable Z  Z is called a confounding factor  Misinterpretation  correlation edit  The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause  Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables  properties  of the population under consideration tend to vary together  as if they were connected  For example  a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people  The two variables are said to be correlated  however  they may or may not be the cause of one another  The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third  previously unconsidered phenomenon  called a lurking variable or confounding variable  For this reason  there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables   See Correlation does not imply causation    Applications edit  Applied statistics  theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics edit  Applied statistics comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics          Theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference  as well as encompassing mathematical statistics  Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference  but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments  Statistical consultants can help organizations and companies that don t have in house expertise relevant to their particular questions   Machine learning and data mining edit  Machine learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that capture patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms   Statistics in academia edit  Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines  including natural and social sciences  government  and business  Business statistics applies statistical methods in econometrics  auditing and production and operations  including services improvement and marketing research      In the field of biological sciences  the    most frequent statistical tests are  Analysis of Variance  ANOVA   Chi Square Test  Student s T Test  Linear Regression  Pearson s Correlation Coefficient  Mann Whitney U Test  Kruskal Wallis Test  Shannon s Diversity Index  Tukey s Test disambiguation needed   Cluster Analysis  Spearman s Rank Correlation Test and Principal Component Analysis      A typical statistics course covers descriptive statistics  probability  binomial and normal distributions  test of hypotheses and confidence intervals  linear regression  and correlation      Modern fundamental statistical courses for undergraduate students focus on correct test selection  results interpretation  and use of free statistics software       Statistical computing edit   gretl  an example of an open source statistical package Main article  Computational statistics The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the   th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science  Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models  but powerful computers  coupled with suitable numerical algorithms  caused an increased interest in nonlinear models  such as neural networks  as well as the creation of new types  such as generalized linear models and multilevel models  Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling  such as permutation tests and the bootstrap  while techniques such as Gibbs sampling have made use of Bayesian models more feasible  The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on  experimental  and  empirical  statistics  A large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available  Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as Mathematica  SAS  SPSS  and R   Statistics applied to mathematics or the arts edit  Traditionally  statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi standardized methodology that was  required learning  in most sciences  citation needed  This tradition has changed with the use of statistics in non inferential contexts  What was once considered a dry subject  taken in many fields as a degree requirement  is now viewed enthusiastically  according to whom   Initially derided by some mathematical purists  it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas   In number theory  scatter plots of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns  which may then lead to hypotheses  Methods of statistics including predictive methods in forecasting are combined with chaos theory and fractal geometry to create video works that are considered to have great beauty  citation needed  The process art of Jackson Pollock relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed  citation needed  With the advent of computers  statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art  citation needed  Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in performance art  as in a card trick based on a Markov process that only works some of the time  the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology  Statistics can be used to predicatively create art  as in the statistical or stochastic music invented by Iannis Xenakis  where the music is performance specific  Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected  it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics  Specialized disciplines edit  Main article  List of fields of application of statistics Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research  including  biostatistics  computational biology  computational sociology  network biology  social science  sociology and social research  Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have specialized terminology  These disciplines include    Actuarial science  assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries  Applied information economics Astrostatistics  statistical evaluation of astronomical data  Biostatistics Chemometrics  for analysis of data from chemistry  Data mining  applying statistics and pattern recognition to discover knowledge from data  Data science Demography  statistical study of populations  Econometrics  statistical analysis of economic data  Energy statistics Engineering statistics Epidemiology  statistical analysis of disease  Geography and geographic information systems  specifically in spatial analysis Image processing Jurimetrics  law  Medical statistics Political science Psychological statistics Reliability engineering Social statistics Statistical mechanics  In addition  there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology    Bootstrap   jackknife resampling Multivariate statistics Statistical classification Structured data analysis Structural equation modelling Survey methodology Survival analysis Statistics in various sports  particularly baseball   known as sabermetrics   and cricket  Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well  It is used to understand measurement systems variability  control processes  as in statistical process control or SPC   for summarizing data  and to make data driven decisions  In these roles  it is a key tool  and perhaps the only reliable tool   See also edit  Library resources about  Statistics  Resources in your library  Main article  Outline of statistics  Abundance estimation Data
