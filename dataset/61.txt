telecommunications carrier of the United Kingdom until       Before the Acts of Union       it was the postal system of the Kingdom of England  established by Charles II in          Similar General Post Offices were established across the British Empire  In      the GPO was abolished and the assets transferred to The Post Office  changing it from a Department of State to a statutory corporation  In       the telecommunications and postal sides were split prior to British Telecommunications  conversion into a totally separate publicly owned corporation the following year as a result of the British Telecommunications Act       For the more recent history of the postal system in the United Kingdom  see the articles Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd  Originally  the GPO was a state monopoly covering the despatch of items from a specific sender to a specific receiver  which was to be of great importance when new forms of communication were invented  The creation of the GPO  then the General Letter Office  was legislated for by the Parliament of England after The Restoration  which returned the British Isles to monarchy under the House of Stuart  The postal service was known as the Royal Mail because it was built on the distribution system for royal and government documents  An earlier system had been set up under the republican Commonwealth of England  Scotland  and Ireland in      under a Postmaster General  whose office was created anew in      and existed until its abolition  along with the GPO itself  by the Post Office Act        Contents    Early postal services

Postage stamps and postal history of Great BritainIn      an Act entitled Postage of England  Scotland and Ireland Settled set up a system for the British Isles  which had been unified under Oliver Cromwell as a result of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and enacted the position of Postmaster General  The Act also reasserted the postal monopoly for letter delivery and for post horses  After the Restoration in       a further Act     Car II  c     confirmed this and the post of Postmaster General  the previous Cromwellian Act being void      The former site of the General Letter Office in London      saw the establishment of the General Letter Office in the restored Kingdom of England  which would later become the General Post Office  GPO      A similar position evolved in the Kingdom of Scotland prior to the      Acts of Union  Clerks at work at the post office in London circa      The GPO created a network of post offices where senders could submit items  All post was transferred from the post office of origination to distribution points called sorting stations  and from there the post was then sent on for delivery to the receiver of the post  Initially it was the recipient of the post who paid the fee  and he had the right to refuse to accept the item if he did not wish to pay  The charge was based on the distance the item had been carried so the GPO had to keep a separate account for each item  In      the Uniform Penny Post was introduced  which incorporated the two key innovations of a uniform postal rate  which cut administrative costs and encouraged use of the system  and adhesive pre paid stamp   Headquarters edit   The   th century headquarters of the General Post Office in St Martins le Grand in the City of London The first general post office in London opened in          just   years after King Charles I legalised use of the royal posts for private correspondence     It was probably on Cloak Lane near Dowgate Hill     Coffee houses in the City such as Lloyd s and Garraway s organised private transport of mail among their patrons  The Royal Mail  which  following its legalisation  held a nominal monopoly on such delivery services  moved its headquarters to Lombard Street in the City in      to better curtail such practices     After purchasing adjacent property in the centre of London s financial district gradually became prohibitively expensive  the General Post Office purchased slums on the east side of St  Martin s Le Grand and cleared them to establish a new headquarters  Britain s first purpose built mail facility  The General Post Office  designed with Grecian ionic porticoes by Sir Robert Smirke  was built between      and       ran     feet      m  long and    feet     m  deep  and was lit with a thousand gas burners at night       The Inland Letter Office at the General Post Office in      In the mid   th century there were four branch offices in London  one in the City at Lombard Street  two in the West End at Charing Cross and Old Cavendish Street near Oxford Street  and one south of the Thames in Borough High Street     In the     s  a new building was added on the western side of the street to house the telegraph department  and the General Post Office North was built immediately north of the telegraph building in the     s  When the Central London Railway was built in      its nearby station was named  Post Office   Smirke s building was felt to be too small by this time  however  and in      the headquarters was moved to the King Edward Building  In       the former GPO East was demolished  the current headquarters of BT  a post World War II building  occupies the site of the old Telegraph Office   New communication systems edit  When new forms of communication came into existence in the   th and early   th centuries the GPO claimed monopoly rights on the basis that like the postal service they involved delivery from a sender and to a receiver  The theory was used to expand state control of the mail service into every form of electronic communication possible on the basis that every sender used some form of distribution service  citation needed  These distribution services were considered in law as forms of electronic post offices  This applied to telegraph and telephone switching stations   Telegraph edit   Telegraph sent in       In the mid   th century several private telegraph companies were established in the UK  The Telegraph Act      granted the Postmaster General the right to acquire inland telegraph companies in the United Kingdom and the Telegraph Act      conferred on the Postmaster General a monopoly in telegraphic communication in the UK  The responsibility for the  electric telegraphs  was officially transferred to the GPO in       Overseas telegraphs did not fall within the monopoly  The private telegraph companies that already existed were bought out  The new combined telegraph service had       telegraph offices in towns and cities and       offices at railway stations            telegrams were transmitted in      producing revenue of              London s Central Office in the first decade of nationalized telegraphy created two levels of service  High status circuits catering to the state  international trade  sporting life  and imperial business  Low status circuits directed toward the local and the provincial  These distinct telegraphic orbits were connected to different types of telegraph instruments operated by differently gendered telegraphists      Telephone edit   Telephone kiosk and Edward VII pillar box The Post Office commenced its telephone business in       however the vast majority of telephones were initially connected to independently run networks  In December       the Post Master General obtained a court judgement that telephone conversations were  technically  within the remit of the Telegraph Act  The General Post Office then licensed all existing telephone networks  The effective nationalisation of the UK telecommunications industry occurred in      with the takeover of the National Telephone Company which left only a few municipal undertakings independent of the GPO  in particular Hull Telephones Department and the telephone system of Guernsey   The telephone systems of Jersey and the Isle of Man  obtained from the NTC were offered for sale to the respective governments of the islands  Both initially refused  but the States of Jersey did eventually take control of their island s telephones in        Radio edit  The development of radio links for sending telegraphs led to the Wireless Telegraphy Act       which granted control of radio waves to the General Post Office  who licensed all senders and receivers  This placed the Post Office in a position of control over radio and television broadcasting as those technologies were developed   Control of broadcasting edit  In      a group of radio manufacturers formed the British Broadcasting Company  BBC   which was the sole organisation granted a broadcasting licence by the GPO  In       the original BBC was dissolved and reformed by Royal Charter as the British Broadcasting Corporation  From the start the GPO had trouble with competitive pirate radio broadcasters who found ways to deliver electronic messages to British receivers without first obtaining a GPO licence  These competitors were well aware of the fact that the GPO would never grant them such a licence  To police these unlicensed stations the GPO evolved its own force of detectives and  detector vans   The radio regulation functions were transferred to the Independent Broadcasting Authority and later Ofcom  Due to its regulatory role  as well as its expertise in developing long distance communication networks  the GPO was contracted by the BBC  and the ITA in the     s and   s  to develop and extend their television networks  A network of transmitters was built  connected at first by cable  and later by microwave radio links  The Post Office also took responsibility for the issuing of television licence fees  and radio  until        and the prosecution of evaders until        Growth in telecommunications edit  See also  TXK and TXE After the Second World War  there began to be an unprecedented demand for telephone services  In addition  there was the need to make comprehensive repairs  and upgrades to a network which had been severely degraded by war  and lack of investment  Waiting lists for new telephone lines quickly emerged  and persisted for several decades  To alleviate the situation  the Post Office began to provide shared service lines  each known as a party line  Most of the line was shared between two subscribers usually splitting off to each within sight of the houses  and both lines attracted a small discount  however  this arrangement had its disadvantages  At this time  the majority of lines in rural  and regional areas  particularly in Scotland and Wales  were still manually switched  This inhibited growth  and caused bottlenecks in the network  as well as being labour and cost intensive  The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching  and replaced all of its       exchanges  Subscriber Trunk Dialling  STD  was also added from       which allowed subscribers to dial their own long distance calls   Banking services edit  The Post Office Savings Bank was introduced in       when there were few banks outside major towns  By             post offices were offering a savings service  Gradually more financial services were offered by post offices  including government stocks and bonds in       insurance and annuities in       and war savings certificates in       In      old age pensions were introduced  payable at post offices      In      a lottery bond called the Premium Bond was introduced  In the mid     s the GPO was asked by the government to expand into banking services which resulted in the creation of the National Giro      In       the Post Office Savings Bank was transferred to the Treasury  and renamed National Savings       Reorganisation edit  Ireland edit  In      the office of Postmaster General of Ireland was amalgamated with the equivalent office for Great Britain  The GPO thereafter operated throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the next    years  Following the Anglo Irish Treaty of      responsibility for posts and telegraphs transferred to the new Provisional Government and then  upon the formal independence of the Irish Free State in December       to the Free State Government  A Postmaster General was initially appointed by the Free State Government  being replaced by the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in       An early visible manifestation was the repainting of all post boxes green instead of red  In      the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was replaced by the separate Irish state owned companies An Post and Telecom  ireann       s reviews edit  The Bridgeman Committee  chaired by Lord Bridgeman  was set up in      to investigate criticisms of the General Post Office and reported the same year      It highlighted defects in the structure of the organisation  The Gardiner Committee  chaired by Sir Thomas Gardiner  was set up to investigate improvements in efficiency and reported in       The report recommended the setting up of eight provincial regions outside London  notes    and the introduction of the London Postal Region and London Telecommunications Region for the capital and surrounding area  The changes were implemented between      and        Dissolution edit  Under the Post Office Act       the assets of the Post Office were transferred from a government department with a Royal Charter to a statutory corporation  Responsibility for telecommunications was given to Post Office Telecommunications  the successor of the GPO Telegraph and Telephones department  with its own separate budget and management  A rebranding exercise also took place  with the word  General  being dropped from the name  In       the familiar striped  Post Office  lettering was introduced  which continues to be in use by Royal Mail  Jersey Post and Guernsey Post became independent in        Isle of Man Post purchased GPO assets on the island and commenced operation on   July       The British Telecommunications Act      split off the telecommunications business to form the British Telecommunications corporation  leaving the Post Office corporation with the Royal Mail  parcels  Post Office Counters and National Giro businesses  British Telecommunications was converted to British Telecommunications plc in       and was privatised  Girobank was divested to Alliance   Leicester in       As part of the Postal Services Act       the businesses of the Post Office were transferred in      to a public limited company  Consignia plc  which was quickly renamed Royal Mail Holdings plc  The government became the sole shareholder in Royal Mail Holdings plc and its subsidiary Post Office Ltd  Finally  on   April       the government published the Dissolution of the Post Office Order       under which the old Post Office statutory corporation was formally abolished with effect from   May        Links to the intelligence services edit  For some time a department called the GPO Special Investigations Unit was responsible for intercepting letters   postal interception   as part of British intelligence service operations  The unit had branches in every major sorting office in the UK and in St Martin s Le Grand GPO  near St Paul s Cathedral  Letters targeted for interception by the Special Investigations Unit were steamed open and the contents photographed  and the photographs were then sent in unmarked green vans to MI        Military links edit   Soldiers of the National Army of the Irish Free State searching through the remains of a fire at the Rotunda Rink  Parnell Square  which was the
