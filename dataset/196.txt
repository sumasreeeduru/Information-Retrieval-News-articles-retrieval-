city of Jordan and the country s economic  political and cultural centre     With a population of            Amman is the largest city in the Levant region and the sixth largest city in the Arab world     The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as  Ain Ghazal  where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to      BC were uncovered  During the Iron Age  the city was known as Ammon  home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites  It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman periods  and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period  For much of the early and middle Islamic periods   th   th centuries   it served as a center for the Balqa district of Syria  Afterwards  Amman was a largely abandoned site until the late   th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman Empire in       The first municipal council was established in          Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan s capital in       and after several successive waves of refugees  Palestinians in      and       Iraqis in      and       and Syrians since       It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over    hills combining    areas     which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor Yousef Shawarbeh     Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills  Jabal  or the valleys  Wadi  they occupy  such as Jabal Lweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun     East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities  while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city     Approximately two million visitors arrived in Amman in       which made it the   rd most visited city in the world and the  th most visited Arab city      Amman has a relatively fast growing economy      and it is ranked as a Beta  global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network      Moreover  it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa s best cities according to economic  labor  environmental  and socio cultural factors      The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices  alongside Doha and only behind Dubai  It is expected that in the next    years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region       Contents    Etymology   History      Ancient period     Classical period     Islamic era     Modern era     Geography      Climate     Local government

term Rabbath meaning the  Capital  or the  King s Quarters   Over time  the term  Rabbath  was no longer used and the city became known as  Ammon   The influence of new civilizations that conquered the city gradually changed its name to  Amman       In the Hebrew Bible  it is referred to as  Rabbat  Ammon   Biblical Hebrew             Tiberian Hebrew Rabba   Amm n   However  Ptolemy II Philadelphus  the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from     to     BC  renamed the city to  Philadelphia   Ancient Greek               literally   brotherly love   after occupying it  The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname  Philadelphus       History edit  See also  Timeline of Amman Ancient period edit  Main articles   Ain Ghazal and Ammon   Ain Ghazal Statues on display at The Jordan Museum  Dating back to      BC  they are considered to be among the oldest human statues ever found      The neolithic site of  Ain Ghazal was found in the outskirts of Amman  At its height  around      BC  it had an area of    hectares     acres  and was inhabited by ca       people  four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho   At that time the site was a typical aceramic Neolithic village  Its houses were rectangular mud bricked buildings that included a main square living room  whose walls were made up of lime plaster      The site was discovered in      as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area  By       when the excavations started  around     meters        feet  of road ran through the site  Despite the damage brought by urban expansion  the remains of  Ain Ghazal provided a wealth of information        Ain Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in       when local archaeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit     meters      feet  containing them      These statues are human figures made with white plaster  with painted clothes  hair  and in some cases ornamental tattoos  Thirty two figures were found in two caches  fifteen of them full figures  fifteen busts  and two fragmentary heads  Three of the busts were two headed  the significance of which is not clear      Rujm Al Malfouf Ammonite watch tower built around      BC In the   th century BC Amman was the capital of the Ammonites  and became known as  Rabbath Ammon   Ammon provided several natural resources to the region  including sandstone and limestone  along with a productive agricultural sector that made Ammon a vital location along the King s Highway  the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia  Syria and Anatolia  As with the Edomites and Moabites  trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue      Ammonites worshiped an ancient deity called Moloch  Excavations by archaeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple  which included an altar containing many human bone fragments  The bones showed evidence of burning  which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre        View of Qasr Al Abd Today  several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist  such as Qasr Al Abd  Rujm Al Malfouf and some parts of the Amman Citadel  The ruins of Rujm Al Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east          The city was later conquered by the Assyrian Empire  followed by the Persian Empire   Classical period edit   Temple of Hercules at the Amman Citadel  Jabal Al Qalaa  Conquest of the Middle East and Central Asia by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture      The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern day Jordan  including Umm Qays  Jerash and Amman  Ptolemy II Philadelphus  the Macedonian ruler of Egypt  who occupied and rebuilt the city  named it  Philadelphia   Ancient Greek                 evoking  brotherly love  in Greek  The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname  Philadelphus      One of the most original monuments in Jordan  and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East  is the village of Iraq Al Amir in the valley of Wadi Al Sir  southwest of Amman  which is home to Qasr Al Abd  Castle of the Slave   Other nearby ruins include a village  an isolated house and a fountain  all of which are barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year          Qasr Al Abd is believed to have been built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem  who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family  Shortly after he began the construction of that large building  in     BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt  Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem  ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus  Upon hearing this  Hyrcanus committed suicide  leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted      The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them  After losing Philadelphia  we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources        The Roman Theatre built around     AD The Romans conquered much of the Levant in    BC  inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries  In the northern modern day Jordan  the Greek cities of Philadelphia  Amman   Gerasa  Gedara  Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and Syria  Scythopolis  Hippos  Capitolias  Canatha and Damascus to form the Decapolis League  a fabled confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest      Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in     AD  This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time  During the late Byzantine era in the seventh century  several bishops and churches were based in the city      Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country  some of which exist in Amman  such as the Temple of Hercules at the Amman Citadel  the Roman Theatre  the Odeon  and the Nymphaeum  The two theatres and the Nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around AD      The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for       attendees  It was oriented north and built into the hillside  to protect the audience from the sun  To the northeast of the theatre was a small odeon  Built at roughly the same time as the theatre  the Odeon had     seats and is still in use today for music concerts  Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather  The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia s chief fountain  The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a     square meters        sq ft  pool which was   meters      ft  deep and was continuously refilled with water       Islamic era edit  See also  Desert castles  The Umayyad Palace on top of the Amman Citadel built around     AD In the    s  the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the region from the Byzantines  beginning the Islamic era in the Levant  Philadelphia was renamed  Amman  by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund al Urdunn  A large part of the population already spoke Arabic  which facilitated integration into the caliphate  as well as several conversions to Islam  Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in     AD  numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern day Jordan  several of which are still well preserved  Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre  The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill  known today as the Umayyad Palace  Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters  including a particularly severe earthquake in      The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later      Amman s importance declined by the mid  th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable      Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids           and the Fatimids                 In the late  th century  Amman was noted as the  capital  of the Balqa by geographer al Yaqubi      Likewise  in      the Jerusalemite historian al Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa      and that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and was a regional source of lambs  grain and honey      Furthermore  al Muqaddasi describes Amman as a  harbor of the desert  where Arab Bedouin would take refuge  and that its citadel  which overlooked the town  contained a small mosque        Ottoman railway ten arches bridge  built in      in Amman The occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources  William of Tyre writes in his Historia that in      Philip of Milly received the castle of  Ahamant   which is seen to refer to Amman  as part of the lordship of Oultrejordain      In      Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar  passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of Ahamant     or  Haman   as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric      By       Amman was in Ayyubid hands      The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill  first attributed to the Crusaders  now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period  leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle      During the Ayyubid period  the Damascene geographer al Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al Karak  although  only ruins  remained of the town      During the Mamluk era  late   th early   th centuries   the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa  the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq  Damascus Province       The capital of the district in the first half of the   th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban  which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan  namely Ajlun and al Karak      In       the geographer Abu l Fida  recorded that Amman was  a very ancient town  with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields      For unclear  though likely financial reasons  in       the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman  which was considered a madina  city       In       Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety  most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish  which he built in Cairo that same year      After his purchase of the city  Sirghitmish transferred the courts  administrative bureaucracy  markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman      Moreover  he financed new building works in the city        The first scientific map of Amman        The British surveyors noted that   The Roman period    is the most important period at  Amman  and the ruins are only surpassed in Syria by those of Jerash  Baalbek and Palmyra  which belong to the same period     T he Circassian colony established by the Sultan at Amman about       is  neither prosperous nor likely to become so       Ownership of Amman following Sirghitmish s death in      passed to successive generations of his descendants until       when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al Khwarazmi  the na ib as saltana  viceroy  of Damascus      Afterward  part of Amman s cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al Shaykhuni  died        the na ib as saltana of Egypt      The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman  while at the same time  Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the   th century      From then until       Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water          The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in       but for much of the Ottoman period  al Salt functioned as the virtual political centre of Transjordan   Modern era edit  The historical center of Amman  showing the Roman ruins in      immediately before its modern resettlement  left   and the same area in       right  Amman began to be resettled in       when hundreds of Circassians arrived following their exodus from the Caucasus      between      and       tens of thousands of Circassians had relocated to Ottoman Syria after being displaced by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo Circassian War      The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassian immigrants  who were mainly of peasant stock  to settle in Amman  and distributed arable land among them      Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha s project to establish a vilayet centered in Amman  which  along with other sites in its vicinity  would become Circassian populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus Medina highway      The first Circassian settlers  who belonged to the Shapsug dialect group      lived near Amman s Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built      The English traveller Laurence Oliphant noted in his      visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then  with about     remaining      They were joined by Circassians from the Kabardian and Abzakh groups in                Until      settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud brick houses with wooden roofs      The French Dominican priest Marie Joseph Lagrange commented in      about Amman   A mosque  the ancient bridges  all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy       The new village became a nahiye  subdistrict  centre of the kaza of al Salt in the Karak Sanjak established in           By      Amman contained     houses divided between three main quarters  Shapsug  Kabartai and Abzakh  each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there  a number of mosques  open air markets  shops  bakeries  mills  a textile factory  a post and telegraph office and a government compound  saraya       Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called  al Akrad  after them  while a number of townspeople from nearby al Salt and al Fuheis  seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives  and traders from Najd and Morocco  had also moved to the town        Amman      The British report from      shows around       Circassians living in Amman      Yet the community was far from insulated  They formed alliances both with local urban and nomadic communities and regional grain merchants to cement their status in the newly established city      Amman s first municipal council was established in       and Circassian Ismael Babouk was elected as its mayor      The city s demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government s decision to construct the Hejaz Railway  which linked Damascus and Medina  and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade  Because of its location along the railway  Amman was transformed from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region       The First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt  taking place in       Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway  its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus      The second battle was won by the British  resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate  Amman in      In       the Hashemite emir and later king Abdullah I designated Amman instead of al Salt to be the capital of the newly created state  the Emirate of Transjordan  which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in       Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas  particularly from al Salt  a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time  The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus  from which many of al Salt s inhabitants had originated  They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus  Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country  particularly Al Karak and Madaba  The city s population was around        in the     s      Jordan gained its independence in      and Amman was designated the country s capital  Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries  beginning with the      Arab Israeli War  A second wave arrived after the Six Day War in       In       Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO  and the Jordanian Army known as Black September  The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in       and the latter were expelled to Lebanon      The first wave of Iraqi and Kuwaiti refugees settled in the city after the      Gulf War  with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the      invasion of Iraq     A neighbourhood in Al Ashrafiya in       Amman in      On   November       Al Qaeda under Abu Musab al Zarqawi s leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman  resulting in    deaths and     injured  The bombings  which targeted civilians  caused widespread outrage among Jordanians      Jordan s security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack  and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then          Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in       Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered      During the last ten years  the city has experienced an economic  cultural and urban boom  The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation  and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace  This strained Jordan s scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning   Amman is the site of major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers  The city contains several high end hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman  Sheraton Hotel Amman  Fairmont Amman  St  Regis Hotel Amman  Le Royal Hotel and others    Geography edit   A Greek Orthodox church seen with snow in Amman Amman is situated on the East Bank Plateau  an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it      Originally  the city had been built on seven hills      Amman s terrain is typified by its mountains      The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on      The area s elevation ranges from       to       m        to       ft       Al Salt and al Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast  respectively  Madaba is located to the west  and al Karak and Ma an are to Amman s southwest and southeast  respectively  One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water      Trees found in Amman include Aleppo pine  Mediterranean cypress and Phoenecian juniper       Climate edit   Spring in an affluent neighbourhood in the city Amman s position on the mountains near the Mediterranean climate zone places it under the semi arid climate classification  K ppen climate  BSh borders on BSk   Summers are moderately long  mildly hot and breezy  however  one or two heat waves may occur during summer  Spring is brief and warm  where highs reach     C      F   Spring usually starts between April and May  and lasts about a month  Winter usually starts around the end of November and continues from early to mid March  Temperatures are usually near or below     C      F   with snow occasionally falling once or twice a year  Rain averages about     mm     in  a year and periodic droughts are common  where most rain falls between October and April      At least     days of heavy fog per year is usual      Difference in elevation plays a major role in the different weather conditions experienced in the city  snow may accumulate in the western and northern parts of Amman  an average altitude of       m        ft  above sea level  while at the same time it could be raining at the city centre  elevation of     m        ft   clarification needed  Amman has extreme examples of microclimate  and almost every district exhibits its own weather      It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern suburb of Abu Nser are among the coldest in the city  and can experience frost while other districts such as Marka experience much warmer temperatures  The temperatures listed below are taken from the weather station at the centre of the city which is at an elevation of     metres        ft   above sea level  At higher elevations  the temperatures will be lower during winter and higher during summer  For example  in areas such as al Jubaiha  Sweileh  Khalda  and Abu Nser  Tabarbour  Basman which are at higher than     m        ft  above sea level have average temperatures of   to    C     to     F  in the day and   to    C     to     F  at night
