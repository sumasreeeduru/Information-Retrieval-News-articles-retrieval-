globalization ideals  began broadcasting on September          at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels  The first studio for CNNI was at CNN s original studio building known as Techwood  home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System s channels  Today  it is home to the Turner Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels  Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the CNN Center  and the newsroom lacked even a digital clock  The vast majority of the network s programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels  CNN US and Headline News   In       however  the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly  A new newsroom and studio complex was built in       as CNN decided to compete against BBC World Service Television s news programming  CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel  with staff members of various national backgrounds  even though some accusations of a pro U S  editorial bias persist  CNN International was awarded the Liberty Medal on July          Ted Turner  in accepting the medal on behalf of the network  said   My idea was  we re just going to give people the facts    We didn t have to show liberty and democracy as good  and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad  If we just showed them both the way they were     clearly everybody s going to choose liberty and democracy       New international era             edit   CNN International logo from February          to December           In       creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy  to target CNNI s diverse global market  making the on air look less overtly American and with a cleaner  simpler  international  aesthetic going forward  The word  International  in the channel s logo was replaced with a globe  and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time lapse  channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich  and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York                revamp edit   CNN International logo from January          to September           The network undertook another major rebranding effort in      overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry  The ticker was replaced by a flipper  on screen graphics were more unified and from October      until August       new studios were progressively rolled out  However  on January          CNN International adopted the  lower thirds  that CNN US had introduced a month earlier which were inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts  In the U S   CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the CNNfn financial channel  until that channel s demise in December       It is now available as a standalone  full time channel  usually as part of high tier packages of subscription providers including Time Warner Cable  AT T U Verse  Verizon FiOS and Cox Communications   Going beyond borders             edit  Throughout January until September       CNN International adapted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities  most notably the interview program Amanpour  On September           the channel launched a new tagline  Go Beyond Borders   along with a new logo  and consolidated its general newscasts  World News  CNN Today  World News Asia  World News Europe and Your World Today  into a single newscast entitled World Report  The slogan  Go Beyond Borders  emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences  With this tagline  CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their contents  The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department  and agency CNN Tooth   Nail  An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that adds the broadcast of programs Amanpour and World One  The makeover of CNN International has subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime time lineup and the redesigned graphics  On January           in a bid to compete directly with Al Jazeera English  the network launched a new production center  CNN Abu Dhabi  based in the United Arab Emirates  Then  CNN International adapted half hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for Middle East viewers  Prism  In       CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup in order to improve its schedule  In       programs from CNN U S  were added to the CNN International schedule  including the talk program Piers Morgan Live which was later cancelled and replaced with CNN Tonight hosted by Don Lemon    CNN International logo from      to       This is CNN       present  edit   This is CNN  represents CNN International s rebrand with new sets and output in full      high definition  The  This is CNN  slogan is also used on its sister network CNN in USA  The managing director of CNN International from      to May      was Tony Maddox     In       CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs  with CNNI losing     million per year     Later that year  CNNI cancelled its Asia Pacific Primetime Show  News Stream  anchored by Kristie Lu Stout  effectively ending production output from its Hong Kong Studios      Regional and online versions edit  There are five variants of CNN International   CNN International Asia Pacific  based in Hong Kong  China and Mumbai  India CNN International Europe Middle East Africa  based in London  United Kingdom CNN International in Latin America  based in Atlanta  Georgia  U S  CNN International North America  based in Atlanta  Georgia  U S  CNN International South Asia  based in New Delhi  India The schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other  but there are still minor variations such as content during the commercial breaks  e g  weather forecasts and local airtimes shown   CNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese controlled satellite  With this method of transmission  Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will  CNN has also said that its broadcasts are not widely available in mainland China  but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds  hotels  and apartment blocks     In June       CNN International was made available online in the United States for CNN U S subscribers on participating television providers through the CNNgo service      Simulcasts between CNNI and

pandemic for all editions of The Lead with Jake Tapper  Anderson Cooper       Cuomo Prime Time  both hours of The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and CNN Tonight with Don Lemon  the whole three hours of the weekday edition of New Day  several hours of the CNN U S  CNN Newsroom  the Sunday edition of Inside Politics  State of the Union  Fareed Zakaria GPS  Reliable Sources  Smerconish and some CNN Special Investigations Unit documentaries      The timepiece of CNN US is replaced by that of CNNI  but no longer the ticker  and CNN US s red logo on a white field is retained in the on screen graphic  rather than replaced by CNNI s white logo on a red field   signifying CNN US as the originating source  CNNI also simulcasts CNN U S  newscasts whenever major events happen in the United States or around the world  Examples include the death and funeral of Ronald Reagan  the crash of Continental Airlines Flight      in the Buffalo suburb of Clarence Center  the Hudson River plane landing  the attempted Christmas Day bombing of flight     and the death and memorial service of Michael Jackson as well as scheduled broadcasts such as New Year s Eve Live and Election Night in America  Likewise  CNN U S  occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts  primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U S  A notable case was during the death of Pope John Paul II and the aftermath of the London Underground bombings of July          CNN U S  simulcast CNNI coverage of the death of Pakistan s former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on the night after her assassination took place  Simulcasts also happened from November    to           due to the terror attacks in Mumbai  India  on January          when Israel launched strikes into Gaza  and during the early hours of January           due to the earthquake in Haiti  From      until early       CNNI s Your World Today aired on CNN U S      during the      p m  ET timeslot  That program was initially pre empted by Issue     a program dealing in the American economic  financial  and housing sectors as part of the lead up to the      U S  presidential election  and permanently replaced by another hour of CNN Newsroom in September       During the Atlanta tornado outbreak in March       CNN U S  and CNNI simulcasted coverage after Anderson Cooper      ended  That coverage ended around       a m  EDT     and the channels resumed their normal programming  Furthermore  the next day  with storms impending  CNN U S  had to move onto CNNI s U S  news set and weather center to avoid water from possible flooding during the storms  On January           CNN U S  dropped its early morning rebroadcasts of ParkerSpitzer and Anderson Cooper      during the     a m  ET time period  and began to simulcast World Business Today and World One from CNNI in those slots  Both newscasts are the only programs broadcast entirely in     fullscreen frames on CNN U S   standard definition and high definition feeds  the SD feed of CNN US switched to a widescreen letterbox screen format on January            World One was dropped from CNN U S  just a few months later to allow the addition of an extra hour of American Morning which has been replaced with Early Start  As of August       following the unrest in Ferguson  Missouri  a permanent simulcast of CNNI s block of Newsroom with Rosemary Church and Errol Barnett was added to the late night lineup of CNN U S   serving as a lead in to Early Start  In late       John Vause and anchor Isha Sesay began to anchor a two hour block of the simulcast from CNN studios in Los Angeles      In       CNN International began simulcasting the first hour of the weekday edition of New Day and on September           The Lead with Jake Tapper started to be simulcast on CNNI      In       CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs     Consequently  an additional two hours of simulcasts with CNN U S  on weekdays were added   the first hour of Early Start and the second hour of New Day  resulting in CNNI broadcasting CNN U S  for seven hours each weekday  By mid April       due to the impact of COVID    on CNN s operation  CNN U S  weekday programming accounted for    hours within each    hour cycle of CNN International broadcasting time  with CNN International s daily worldwide programming in Europe consisting of five hours of the international version of CNN Newsroom  from  a m      a m  GMT  and four internationally focused programs  First Move with Julia Chatterley and Connect the World with Becky Anderson between the hours of  p m     p m  GMT  with Amanpour and Quest Means Business  between  p m     p m  GMT       Each of those internationally focused programmes air for one hour each  except Connect the World  which airs for two hours and if live news events are slated to happen during Amanpour s timeslot  that show may air at a different time  Weekend simulcasts of CNN U S  were increased with CNN U S  s live news output shown in full at the time  Apart from between from  a m      a m GMT when editions of the international version of CNN Newsroom were aired alongside magazine programmes  CNN International only showed its own programming   consisting of magazine programmes   when CNN US was broadcasting repeat showings of programmes it had aired earlier that day  As at September       live weekend domestic programming on CNN International has been somewhat reduced to accommodate newer editions of magazine programmes

is now one of the most popular news websites in the world  The widespread growth of blogs  social media and user generated content have influenced the site  and blogs in particular have focused CNN s previously scattershot online offerings  most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late       In April       CNN com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique

from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand  CNN iReport which features user submitted photos and video  has achieved considerable traction  with increasingly professional looking reports filed by amateur journalists  many still in high school or college  The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings      In early       CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to those who receive CNN at home      CNN International is broadcast live  as part of the RealNetworks

Zarrella  Criticism edit   The CNN International logo on a table viewed inside the CNN Center in Atlanta  These tables have since been removed  Accusations of US centric viewpoint edit  Former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief Rebecca MacKinnon described how the news gathering priorities of CNN International were skewed to  produce stories and reports that would be of interest to CNN USA   Nevertheless  Jane Arraf  a former correspondent who was with the Council on Foreign Relations and later served as a Middle East based correspondent for Al Jazeera English  noted that when she spoke on international affairs  CNN International would usually give her more airtime than CNN US  For its own part  former CNN executive Eason Jordan has defended CNN International s  international  perspective  saying  No matter what CNN International does  as long as CNN s headquarters is in the United States people are going to say  well  it s an American service  But the reality is that it s an international service based in the United States  and we don t make any apologies about that        Accusations of pro American bias edit  CNN is one of the world s largest news organizations  and its international channel  CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach          Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus  CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to  and often directly affected by  the events they are reporting  The effect is a more immediate  less detached style of on the ground coverage  This has done little to stem criticism  largely from Middle Eastern nations  that CNN International reports news from a pro American perspective  This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a  liberal  or  anti American  bias   Accusations of anti China bias edit  A Chinese website  anti cnn com      has accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China  with the catchphrase  Don t be so CNN  catching on in the Chinese mainstream as jokingly meaning  Don t be so biased   Pictures used by CNN are allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones  In addition  the channel was accused of largely ignoring pro China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay debacle in San Francisco   Accusations of propaganda and censorship edit  In October       Amber Lyon claimed to the Syrian government news agency SANA that she had been directed by CNN to report selectively  repetitively  and falsely in order to sway public opinion in favor of direct American aggression against Iran and Syria      and that this was common practice under CNN  She subsequently repeated this claim  addressing the degraded state of journalistic ethics in an interview     citation needed  during which she also discussed the Bahraini episode  suggesting paid for content was also taken from Georgia  Kazakhstan  and other states  that the War on Terrorism had also been employed as a pretext to pre empt substantive investigative journalism within the U S   and that following the Bahrain reporting  her investigative department had been terminated and  reorganized   and her severance and employee benefits used as a threat to intimidate and attempt to purchase her subsequent silence  Lyon claimed to have met with Tony Maddox  president of CNN International  twice about this issue in      and had claimed that during the second meeting she was threatened and intimated to stop speaking on the matter      CNN issued a detailed response to Lyon s claims about its coverage of Bahrain      Lyon also claimed on the Russian news channel RT that CNN reporters  headed by Maddox  have been instructed to over cover Iran as a form of propaganda  and that CNN International has been paid by the Bahraini government to produce and air news segments intentionally painting them in a positive light  citation needed   Other dismissals edit  On July          Octavia Nasr  senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for    years  was fired after she expressed admiration on her Twitter account for a militant Muslim cleric and former Hezbollah leader who had recently died       See also edit    Television portal International broadcasting List of news channels References edit       NSS         W
