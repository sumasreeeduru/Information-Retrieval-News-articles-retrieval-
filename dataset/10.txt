continued with The Contributors  a show that featured Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham  as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate  John Gibson  and John Seigenthaler  Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories CNN was running  NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories directly from NBC s network affiliates  along with breaking news coverage from the same sources      MSNBC gradually increased its emphasis on politics      After completing its seven year survey of cable channels  the Project for Excellence in Journalism said in      that   MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand  with a large dose of opinion and personality       In January       Mike Barnicle s MSNBC show started  but it was canceled in June      because of high production costs      In June  Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer said that he would not have started MSNBC had he foreseen the difficulty of attracting viewers      After the September          attacks  NBC used MSNBC as an outlet for the up to the minute coverage being provided by NBC News as a supplement to the longer stories on broadcast NBC  With little financial news to cover  CNBC and CNBC Europe ran MSNBC for many hours each day following the attacks  The year also boosted the profile of Ashleigh Banfield  who was present during the collapse of Building   while covering the World Trade Center on September         Her Region In Conflict program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from Afghanistan      In the aftermath of September     MSNBC began calling itself  America s NewsChannel  and hired opinionated hosts like Alan Keyes  Phil Donahue  Pat Buchanan  and Tucker Carlson      This branding makeover  however  was followed by declining ratings      On December           NBC Universal announced its acquisition of an additional    percent share of MSNBC from Microsoft      which solidified its control over television operations and allowed NBC to further consolidate MSNBC s backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties   The news website msnbc com remained a separate joint venture between Microsoft and NBC for another seven years   NBC later exercised its option to purchase Microsoft s remaining    percent interest in MSNBC  In late       MSNBC began attracting liberal and progressive viewers as Keith Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators during his Countdown With Keith Olbermann program  He especially focused his attention on the Fox News Channel and Bill O Reilly  its principal primetime commentator  On June          Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC after holding the post for two years      Five days later  Dan Abrams

programming with taped specials  On September           Abrams announced that he was leaving his general manager position so he could focus on his      p m  ET talk show  Live With Dan Abrams

Russert s sudden death in June      removed what The Wall Street Journal called the  rudder for the network  and led to a period of transition      During the      presidential election  MSNBC s coverage was anchored by Olbermann  Chris Matthews  and David Gregory  They were widely viewed as the face of the channel s political coverage      During the first three months of the presidential campaign  MSNBC s ratings grew by     percent      Olbermann and Matthews  however  were criticized for expressing left leaning opinions on the channel  Both were later removed from their anchor positions      Audience viewership during the      presidential campaign more than doubled from the      presidential election  and the channel topped CNN in ratings for the first time during the last three months of the campaign in the key       age demographic          In September       the channel hired political analyst and Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow to host a new political opinion program called The Rachel Maddow Show  The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a smart ratings move  where beforehand  MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings      The show regularly outperformed CNN s Larry King Live  and made the channel competitive in the program s time slot for the first time in over a decade          In the first quarter of       MSNBC beat CNN in primetime and overall ratings  marking the first time doing so since           The channel also beat CNN in total adult viewers in March  marking the seventh out of the past eight months that MSNBC achieved that result      In addition  the programs Morning Joe  The Ed Show  Hardball with Chris Matthews  Countdown with Keith Olbermann  and The Rachel Maddow Show finished ahead

than today  a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time       The new campaign embraces the network s politically progressive identity      The two year advertising campaign would cost    million and consist of internet  television  and print advertising      The new positioning has created brand image issues for msnbc com  the umbrella website for the television network  A New York Times article quotes Charlie Tillinghast  president of msnbc com  a separate company  as saying   Both strategies are fine  but naming them the same thing is brand insanity       As a result  msnbc com eventually changed its name to prevent confusion with the television network  MSNBC      it rebranded the more news driven msnbc com as NBCNews com in July           On January           Olbermann announced his departure from MSNBC and the episode would be the final episode of Countdown          His departure received much media attention              MSNBC issued a statement that

news network in primetime  MSNBC s increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at Fox News Channel  MSNBC s May       programming topped the programming of both CNN and Fox News in total viewers and the advertiser coveted younger demographic          Another significant change was made on April           when MSNBC completely removed the news ticker at the bottom of the screen on every program  citing the reason  for a cleaner view that puts our reporting more front and center     and we want viewers to get the best possible experience   At the time of the change  CNN is still running the news ticker during live programming  although its sister network HLN does not   meanwhile Fox News only scraps the news ticker during daytime news programs      On March

 On November          MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Keith Olbermann indefinitely without pay for having contributed         the maximum personal donation limit  to each of three Democratic Party candidates during the      midterm election cycle       NBC News policy prohibited contributions to political campaigns unless NBC News had given its prior permission  On November          Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter       That same day  MSNBC announced that he would be back on the air starting on November         Two weeks later  Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for similar misconduct  The Morning Joe host had donated        to Republican candidates in Florida  Like Olbermann s suspension  Scarborough s was brief  and he returned to the airwaves on November           Martin Bashir edit  Host Martin Bashir resigned after making a controversial comment about Sarah Palin       On November           Bashir criticized Palin for equating the federal debt to slavery       Bashir referred to the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves as described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood  specifically a punishment called  Derby s dose   which forced slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave  Bashir then said   When Mrs  Palin invokes slavery  she doesn t just prove her rank ignorance  She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood  she would be the outstanding candidate              Alec Baldwin edit  Alec Baldwin s      show Up Late with Alec Baldwin was
