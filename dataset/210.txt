national digital radio station in the United Kingdom  operated by the BBC  and specialising only in extended additional sports coverage  It is a sister station to BBC Radio   Live and shares facilities  presenters and management  and is a department of the BBC North Group division  If a news story breaks during the live sport broadcasts on   Live  the sports coverage will be redirected and continued on   Live Sports Extra  whilst   Live switches to live news  The station is only available on digital radio  television platforms and BBC Sounds  From    July        Radio   Live Sports Extra is no longer available for international streaming   Contents    History   Broadcast   Programming   See also   References   External links   History edit   Radio Five Live Sports Extra logo         BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra launched as part of the BBC s expansion into digital radio by launching several digital only stations that would complement existing coverage  At the time of launch  all radio sports coverage was included as part of BBC Radio   Live s mix of news and sport  the longwave frequencies of BBC Radio   or on individual BBC Local Radio stations  As these platforms couldn t appropriately accommodate any additional sports  a new service was launched  BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra  The station began broadcasts at      pm on   February       Juliette Ferrington introduced the first programme   commentary of Manchester United against Sunderland  Despite many television rights to sporting events being heavily fought over by commercial companies  such as Sky Sports and ITV Sport  radio sports coverage for many events are still held by the BBC  the main competitor being the commercial station Talksport  In       the station was rebranded in line with the rest of the network  The new BBC Radio   Live Sports Extra logo was turned into a circular based logo in the colour green  according to research  the green colour was chosen as people associated it with sport     In addition  a new background of blue and red diagonal lines on the same green colour was adopted for promotions for the service  Along with the rebrand  Sports Extra began to become closer aligned with   Live  As a result  the online presence of the station was toned down with only an upcoming schedule remaining  all other details were merged into the   Live website or the new BBC Radio online homepage  In      the station  along with   Live  moved to MediaCityUK in Salford  Greater Manchester   Broadcast edit  The remit of BBC Radio   live Sports Extra is to bring a greater choice of live action to sports fans by offering a part time extension of BBC Radio   live  The service should aim to provide increased value for licence fee payers from the portfolio of sports rights already owned by the BBC by offering alternative coverage to that provided on other UK wide BBC services  All output on   live Sports Extra should be live sports coverage   BBC Trust  BBC Radio   Live Sports Extra Remit    BBC Radio   Live Sports Extra is broadcast only on digital platforms  Unlike sister station   Live  no analogue frequency is used  Instead  the service is only available on DAB Digital Radio and on Digital television through operators on satellite services  such as Sky  cable operators  such as Virgin Media  DTT services  such as Freeview  and on IPTV     The service is also available online through the BBC website  the sub site BBC iPlayer service and the Radioplayer service part owned by the BBC  The BBC iPlayer service also re broadcasts programmes for seven days after original broadcast  Due to rights restrictions  some programmes are only available to UK audiences or are not available on the BBC Website or iPlayer services       BBC Radio   Live Sports Extra s base in Quay House  MediaCityUK  The station is notable in that it is a part time service  only airing throughout sports broadcasts  These broadcasts themselves are also live and uninterrupted  unlike Radio   Live which adds news bulletins and Radio   Longwave which adds the Shipping Forecast into coverage  When the station goes off air  all broadcasts cease as the station does not simulcast any other broadcast  this is unusual on the BBC Radio network as nearly all radio stations now operate    hours a day or simulcast with another service   Radio   simulcasts with the BBC World Service and BBC Local Radio stations broadcast   Live when not on air  A side effect of this lack of simulcast is that those attempting to tune into the station with a DAB Digital Radio will often have difficulty finding the station  Internet stream  which earlier also used to go off air  now broadcasts station promo in a loop  The stations controller is Jonathan Wall  who is also responsible for   Live and is answerable to the BBC North and BBC Audio   Music departments     The station operates from Quay House in MediaCityUK on a single floor alongside   Live  Although   Live Sports Extra uses no studio space  the teams required to organise the match coverage are shared with   Live  The move to Salford took two months  and occurred alongside   Live  in a bid to create a northern media hub and to outsource major production from London  Previously    Live Sports Extra had been located alongside   Live in BBC Television Centre and spread over several floors      Programming edit    Live Sports Extra broadcast a variety of sports including   Test Match Special Cricket World Cup  ICC Champions Trophy  and Twenty   World Cup England cricket tests and One Day Internationals Friends Provident Trophy semi finals and final and Twenty   Cup Cricket s County Championship Full broadcasts of Premier League and Home Nation football if games overlap  with   Live carrying first choice in these cases Major League Baseball s World Series  since      Wimbledon Tennis championships  with the station providing extra court commentary for the first week of the tournament National Hockey League s Stanley Cup Finals Tennis Grand Slam tournament coverage of non final rounds and some other major tennis tournaments  Formula One motor racing Action from any other competition broadcast on   Live Through the      season    Live and   Live Sports Extra carried NFL late games broadcast on Sunday evening  with coverage taken from Westwood One  except the NFL International Series and Super Bowl  which used BBC produced commentaries  Absolute Radio   s acquired the broadcast rights to the NFL beginning in       BBC Radio   Live and   Live Sports Extra reacquired the rights to NFL games for the         playoffs      See also edit    BBC portal BBC Radio   Live BBC Radio   BBC Local Radio Talksport References edit
