covered the entire coin operated entertainment industry  including the  video game industry      Consumer oriented video game journalism began during the golden age of arcade video games  soon after the success of      hit Space Invaders  leading to hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium being aired on television and printed in newspapers and magazines     In North America  the first regular consumer oriented column about video games   Arcade Alley  in Video magazine  began in      and was penned by Bill Kunkel along with Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley     The late     s also marked the first coverage of video games in Japan  with columns appearing in personal computer and manga magazines     The earliest journals exclusively covering video games emerged in late       but early column based coverage continued to flourish in North America and Japan with prominent examples like video game designer Yuji Horii s early     s column in Weekly Sh nen Jump    and Rawson Stovall s nationally syndicated column   The Vid Kid  running weekly ran from      to       The first consumer oriented print magazine dedicated solely to video gaming was Computer and Video Games  which premiered in the U K  in November       This was two weeks ahead of the U S  launch of the next oldest video gaming publication  Electronic Games magazine  founded by  Arcade Alley  writers Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz     As of      update   the oldest video game publications still in circulation are Famitsu  founded in       and The Games Machine  Italy   founded in       The video game crash of      badly hurt the market for video game magazines in North America  Computer Gaming World  CGW  reported in a      article that there were eighteen color magazines covering computer games before the crash but by      CGW was the only surviving magazine in the region     Expanding on this in a discussion about the launch of the NES in North America  Nintendo of America s PR runner Gail Tilden noted that  I don t know that we got any coverage at that time that we didn t pay for      Video game journalism in Japan experienced less disruption as the first magazines entirely dedicated to video games began appearing in       beginning with ASCII s LOGiN  followed by several SoftBank publications and Kadokawa Shoten s Comptiq  The first magazine dedicated to console games  or a specific video game console  was Tokuma Shoten s Family Computer Magazine  also known as Famimaga   which began in      and was focused on Nintendo s   bit Family Computer  This magazine later spawned famous imitators such as Famits   originally named Famicom Ts shin  in      and Nintendo Power in          During the early     s  the practice of video game journalism began to spread east from Europe and west of Japan alongside the emergence of video game markets in countries like China and Russia  Russia s first consumer oriented gaming magazine  Velikij Drakon  was launched in          and China s first consumer oriented gaming magazines  Di nz  Y ux  Ru nji n and Play  launched in mid           Web based edit  There are conflicting claims regarding which of the first two electronic video game magazines was the  first to be published regularly  online  Originally starting as a print fanzine in April           Game Zero magazine  claims to have launched a web page in November           with the earliest formal announcement of the page occurring in April       Game Zero s web site was based upon a printed bi monthly magazine based in Central Ohio with a circulation of      that developed into a CD ROM based magazine with a circulation of         at its peak  The website was updated weekly during its active period from            Another publication  Intelligent Gamer Online   IG Online    debuted a complete web site in April       commencing regular updates to the site on a daily basis despite its  bi weekly  name      Intelligent Gamer had been publishing online for years prior to the popularization of the web  originally having been based upon a downloadable  Intelligent Gamer  publication developed by Joe Barlow and Jeremy Horwitz in           This evolved further under Horwitz and Usenet based publisher Anthony Shubert     into  Intelligent Gamer Online  interactive online mini sites for America Online  AOL  and the Los Angeles Times  TimesLink Prodigy online services in late      and early       At the time  it was called  the first national videogame magazine found only online       Game Zero Magazine ceased active publication at the end of      and is maintained as an archive site  Efforts by Horwitz and Shubert  backed by a strong library of built up web content eventually allowed IG Online to be acquired by Sendai Publishing and Ziff Davis Media  the publishers of then leading United States print publication Electronic Gaming Monthly who transformed the publication into a separate print property in February                    New media edit  Future Publishing exemplifies the old media s decline in the games sector  In      the group saw multi million GBP profits and strong growth      but by early      were issuing profit warnings     and closing unprofitable magazines  none related to gaming       Then  in late November       the publisher reported both a pre tax loss of     million      million USD  and the sale in order to reduce its level of bank debt of Italian subsidiary Future Media Italy      In mid      Eurogamer s business development manager Pat Garratt wrote a criticism of those in print games journalism who had not adapted to the web  drawing on his own prior experience in print to offer an explanation of both the challenges facing companies like Future Publishing and why he believed they had not overcome them      With the rise of eSport popularity  traditional sport reporting websites such ESPN and Yahoo launched their own eSport dedicated sections in early               This move came with controversy  especially in the case of ESPN whose president  John Skipper  stated eSports were a competition instead of a sport      The response to the shift was either great interest or great distaste      However  as of January       ESPN and Yahoo continue their online coverage of eSports  Yahoo eSports ended on June              In addition  ESPN and Yahoo  other contemporary eSport dedicated news sites  like The Score Esports or Dot Esports  cover some of the most widely followed games like Counter Strike  League of Legends  and Dota         Independent edit  While self made print fanzines about games have been around since the first home consoles  the rise of the internet gave independent gaming journalist a new platform  At first ignored by most major game publishers  it was not until the communities developed an influential and dedicated readership  and increasingly produced professional  or near professional  writing that the sites gained the attention of these larger companies  Independent video game websites are generally non profit  with any revenue going back towards hosting costs and  occasionally  paying its writers  As their name suggests  they are not affiliated with any companies or studios  though bias is inherent in the unregulated model to which they subscribe  While many independent sites take the form of blogs  the vast majority in fact  depending on how low down the ladder you look   the  user submitted  model  where readers write stories that are moderated by an editorial team  is also popular  In recent times some of the larger independent sites have begun to be bought up by larger media companies  most often Ziff Davis Media  who now own a string of independent sites  In            IGN and GameSpot announced significant layoffs           The rise of reviews on video oriented sites edit  According to a      article by Mike Rose in Gamasutra   The publicity someone like TotalBiscuit     can bring you compared to mainstay consumer websites like IGN  GameSpot and Game Informer is becoming increasingly significant  A year ago  I would have advised any developer to get in touch with as many press outlets as possible  as soon as possible  I still advise this now  but with the following caveat  You re doing so to get the attention of YouTubers   Rose interviewed several game developers and publishers and concluded that the importance of popular YouTube coverage was most pronounced for indie games  dwarfing that of the dedicated gaming publications      David Auerbach wrote in Slate that the influence of the video games press is waning   Game companies and developers are now reaching out directly to quasi amateur enthusiasts as a better way to build their brands  both because the gamers are more influential than the gaming journalists  and because these enthusiasts have far better relationships with their audiences than gaming journalists do      Nintendo has already been shutting out the video game press for years   He concluded that gaming journalists  audience  gamers  is leaving them for video oriented review sites       Ethics edit  See also  Journalism ethics and standards Journalism in the computer and video game media industry has been a subject of debate since at least            Conflicts of interest and pressure from game publishers edit  Publications reviewing a game often receive advertising revenue and entertainment from the game s publishers  which can lead to perceived conflicts of interest      Reviews by  official  platform specific magazines such as Nintendo Power  Official PlayStation Magazine or the Official Xbox Magazine typically have direct financial ties to their respective platform holders  citation needed  In       The  DO Company s president sent an email to GamePro threatening to reduce their advertising spend following a negative review      In       Jeff Gerstmann was fired from GameSpot after posting a review on Kane   Lynch  Dead Men that was deemed too negative by its publisher  which also advertised heavily on the website          Due to non disclosure agreements  Gerstmann was not able to talk about the topic publicly until           In a      article for Eurogamer  Robert Florence criticised the relationship between the video games press and publishers  characterising it as  almost indistinguishable from PR   and questioned the integrity of a games journalist  Lauren Wainwright              In the controversy that followed  dubbed  Doritogate   after a video of Geoff Keighley emerged of him sitting in front of bottles of Mountain Dew  bags of Doritos and an ad banner for Halo     the threat of legal action the result of broad libel laws in the UK caused Eurogamer to self censor      Florence was forced to amend his article  and he consequently retired from games journalism              According to a July      survey by Mike Rose in Gamasutra  approximately a quarter of high profile YouTube gaming channels receive pay from the game publishers or developers for their coverage  especially those in the form of Let s Play videos      Following the Gamergate controversy that started in August       both Destructoid and The Escapist tightened their disclosure and conflict of interest policies      Kotaku editor in chief Stephen Totilo said writers were no longer allowed to donate to Patreon campaigns of developers       Kotaku later disclosed that journalist Patricia Hernandez  who had written for them  was friends with developers Anna Anthropy and Christine Love  as well as being Anthropy s former housemate          Polygon announced that they would disclose previous and future Patreon contributions       Review scores and aggregate ratings edit  Reviews performed by major video game print sources  websites  and mainstream newspapers that sometimes carry video game such as The New York Times and The Washington Post are generally collected for consumers at sites like Metacritic  Game Rankings  and Rotten Tomatoes  If the reviews are scored or graded  these sites will convert that to a numerical score and use a calculation to come out with an aggregate score  In the case of Metacritic  these scores are further weighted by an importance factor associated with the publication  Metacritic also is known to evaluate unscored reviews and assign a numeric score for this as well based on the impression the site editors get about the review      Within the industry  Metacritic has become a measure of the critical success of a game by game publishers  frequently used in its financial reports to impress investors  The video game industry typically does not pay on residuals but instead on critical performance      Prior to release  a publisher may include contractual bonuses to a developer if they achieve a minimum Metacritic score  In one of the more recognized examples  members of Obsidian Entertainment were to have gotten bonuses from Bethesda Softworks for their work on Fallout  New Vegas if they obtained a Metacritic score of    or better out of      After release  the game only obtained an    aggregate score from Metacritic  one point away  and Bethesda refused to pay them          Video game reviewers are aware of their impact on the Metacritic score and subsequent effect on bonus payment schemes  Eurogamer  prior       were aware that they generally graded games on a scoring scale lower than other websites  and would pull down the overall Metacritic score  For this reason  the site dropped review scores in       and their scores are no longer included in these aggregate scores  Kotaku also dropped review scores for the same reason       Rumors  confidential information  and blacklisting edit  A good deal of information in the video game industry is kept under wraps by developers and publishers until the game s release  even information regarding the selection of voice actors is kept under high confidential agreements      However  rumors and leaks of such information still fall into the hands of video game journalists  often from anonymous sources from within game development companies  and it becomes a matter of journalistic integrity whether to publish this information or not  Kotaku has self reported on the downsides of reporting yet revealed information and dealing with subsequent video game publisher backlash as a result      In       the site published information about the upcoming PlayStation Home before Sony had announced it  and Sony severed its relationship with Kotaku  When Kotaku reported this on their site  readers complained to Sony about this  and Sony reversed its decision  Kotaku has also published significant detailed histories on troubled game development for titles such as for Doom   and Prey    as well as announcing titles months in advance from the publisher  In November       the site reported they had been  blacklisted  by Bethesda and Ubisoft for at least a year  they no longer got review copies  nor received press information from the publishers  nor can interact with any of their company s representatives       New Games Journalism edit  New Games Journalism  NGJ  is a video game journalism term  coined by journalist Kieron Gillen     in       in which personal anecdotes  references to other media  and creative analyses are used to explore game design  play  and culture      It is a model of New Journalism applied to video game journalism  Gillen s NGJ manifesto was first published on the now defunct state forum website  a community of video game players often engaged in discussion and analysis of their hobby  from which an anecdotal piece   Bow Nigger       had appeared  Gillen cites the work as a major inspiration for and example of what NGJ should achieve citation needed  and the piece was later re published in the UK edition of PC Gamer  a magazine with which Gillen has close professional ties  Most NGJ articles are not reviews of games in the traditional sense  They can instead be understood as being analogous to travel journalism  where the writer responds to subjective experiences presented to them by the game world  as well as interactions with other players online  real world events surrounding gameplay  and other personal experiences and anecdotes which create a unique story  The story is not necessarily indicative of the experience any other player will have with the game and will be unlikely to offer any objective value judgements regarding the game s merits or failings  citation needed  Instead  attention is focused on the subjective experience of the person playing the game      better source needed   Retro game reviews edit  As retrogaming grew in popularity  so did reviews and examinations of older video games      This is primarily due to feelings of nostalgia to video games people have grown up with  which  according to professor Clay Routledge  may be more powerful than similar nostalgic emotions caused by other artforms  such as music      This also includes the remasterization and review of older video games  with such  as reviewing the critical aspects of the game and how it is delivered to a modern aspect   See also edit  List of books about video games List of video game magazines References edit       Play Meter   Play Meter  Archived from the original on
