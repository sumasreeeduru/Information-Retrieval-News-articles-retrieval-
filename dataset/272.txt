       Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search  Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom was originally the method by which the significant majority of viewers in the UK  the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man received television  Analogue terrestrial television broadcasts have ceased everywhere in the UK with Northern Ireland being the last region to have ceased broadcasting analogue terrestrial television broadcasts  Northern Ireland switched off the last analogue television signals  making all of the United Kingdom only capable of receiving digital television  in the early hours of    October       It has been completely replaced by digital terrestrial television and

of a number of regional franchises  Channel    S C in Wales before analogue services closed there   Channel   Prior to the cessation of analogue services  the first four services were available to     of households  with the more recent Channel   available to around      There were additionally a number a smaller local channels available in particular areas  such as Channel M  which was available in Manchester and Six TV available in Oxford  Southampton  Reading and Portsmouth  ITV  BBC One and BBC Two carried regional programmes  such as the local news  and continue to do so digitally  The ITV Network is made up of a number of regional operators  though a series of consolidations it all being owned by ITV plc  bar two   Additional services edit  All channels carried at least one teletext service  This included subtitles for many programmes   Broadcasters edit  The terrestrial analogue services themselves were in most cases unique when compared to most non analogue broadcast services  such as those available via digital satellite   in that they are much older  contain a much more diverse range of programming  rather than centring on a specific genre  all five major stations carry news bulletins  for example  and all hold some form of public service requirement in terms of their output   BBC edit  The BBC  British Broadcasting Corporation  began a regular television service  one of the first in the world  in      as the BBC Television Service  funded to this day by a yearly mandatory licence fee  Since      the BBC have provided two analogue television services  BBC One and BBC Two  Both services carried a wide variety of content as well as regional variations in programming and sometimes continuity  Latterly the BBC Two variations have been limited to England  Northern Ireland  Scotland and Wales  For many years  BBC One in Wales was effectively a separate service  BBC Wales  though many programmes were common to both it and BBC One proper   ITV edit  ITV  Independent Television  was established in       providing the first commercial alternative to the BBC  Programmes would be funded through the  selling  of air time for the playing of advertisements  the broadcasters  the first of which began broadcasting in       would be privately owned  An Independent Television Authority  ITA    superseded by the Independent Broadcasting Authority  IBA   Independent Television Commission  ITC  and latterly Ofcom  would choose the companies licensed to broadcast on a periodic basis  Each company would be  and nominally still is  afforded a  franchise  to broadcast to a specific coverage area of the UK  with larger areas sometimes having two broadcasters  time sharing  a channel between weekdays and weekends  A separate nationwide  breakfast  franchise also began in       Most viewers would only receive one service  unless they happened to receive signals from two transmitters in different areas   Each regional  franchisee  would broadcast a combination of unique regional programmes and shared  networked  content aired nationwide  the latter practice becoming ever more commonplace throughout the network s history  Originally each company would broadcast with their own  unique station name  such as  Yorkshire Television  or  Associated Rediffusion   with separate continuity announcers and on screen presentation  It was not until the late     s that popular use of the name  ITV  was used as a major on screen brand  a practice which did not become universal in the ITV plc owned regions until the early     s  ITV was established as a public service broadcaster with various requirements placed upon it affecting the nature of broadcast content  mandatory programming  daily limits on broadcast hours  strict controls on advertising practices and the process by which franchises were awarded  Various relaxations on these requirements and restrictions were made throughout its history  with a substantial set of deregulation taking place upon the implementation of the Broadcasting Act       Lifting of ownership restrictions resulting from this act and subsequent acts resulted in a single ITV plc owning and operating the majority of franchises by the early     s  with a common identity as  ITV   Three exceptions remain  STV Group plc  owns two franchises in Scotland broadcasting as STV whilst UTV broadcasts to Northern Ireland under that name  Other relaxations have substantially reduced the requirement for ITV to air particular types of programmes  though requirements such as local and national news provision remain  The      act formally introduced the legal title of  Channel     though with limited exceptions this has never been used on screen  For many years  the ITA  IBA and the ITV companies campaigned for further frequencies on which to broadcast  though these goals were never wholly realised on analogue   Channel   and S C edit  After many decades of demand by the commercial broadcasters for a second commercial station or network of stations  Channel   and S C were launched in       Channel   was originally run as a uniform national service  by the IBA through a subsidiary  the Channel Four Broadcasting Company  Channel   does not make the programmes it broadcasts  content is commissioned from independent  private production companies such as the ITV companies and companies not related to ITV who had previously little space to broadcast in the UK  Channel   was originally funded by allowing each local ITV franchisee to sell adverts during the station s airtime in their area in exchange for a guaranteed income to be paid to the IBA  The station was established with the intention to provide programmes for minority groups and cater for specialist interests and has a remit that details these obligations  Since the abolition of the IBA  which took effect in       Channel   has been run by the publicly owned  Channel Four Television Corporation and manages its own advertising  S C  Welsh  Sianel Pedwar Cymru  Channel   Wales  began broadcasts the day before Channel   after demands for a dedicated Welsh language service for Wales  Previously ITV and the BBC were obliged to air Welsh language programmes  though these were often shown at off peak times  S C broadcast in place of Channel   which would never be available in Wales via analogue terrestrial  consequently some Channel   programmes were aired during off peak times on S C  Digital platforms in Wales provide both services  S C s digital variant airing Welsh language content only  S C is operated by the S C Authority  independent of the IBA and latterly Ofcom and is funded through advertising and direct government funding  The BBC also airs its Welsh language programmes on the service  funded by the licence fee  S C ceased broadcasting on analogue at the end of March       when the last analogue television transmissions in Wales ended   Channel   edit  A fifth service was licensed during the     s and began broadcasts in       called Channel    it has since been re branded as Five and later back to Channel   in August       The Channel   licence has one single licensee and provides a nationwide service  Compared to the other analogue broadcasters  it has relatively few public service obligations  provision of news programming being one exception  Limited space within the analogue television bands meant Channel   had substantially reduced coverage compared to the other networks  at around     coverage   Restricted service licences edit  Main article  Restricted Service Licence In addition to the five national networks  a limited number of local stations were broadcast to various towns and cities under what was known as a Restricted Service Licence  These occupied channels unused by the other broadcasters that could be used without causing interference in other regions  and were frequently broadcast at a lower power than the major channels  Their output was mainly local  and each contract for an RSL lasted four years until      when media regulator Ofcom stated that each licence will be renewed up until digital switchover

began on an experimental basis by the BBC in London in      on VHF Band I  Initially the service was operated using two competing systems  The earliest television broadcasts used the     line Baird system and the     line Marconi EMI system on alternate weeks  However  the Baird system proved too cumbersome and by early      had been dropped and the Marconi EMI system became the standard  This system was later codified by the ITU s CCIR  now ITU R  on an international conference in Stockholm in      as System A  Different broadcast stations across the country were broadcast on different channels to avoid interference and allow for regional variations  Broadcast was suspended during the Second World War but resumed in       The BBC was joined on this system in      with the launch of commercial television in the form of the regional Independent Television  ITV  network  managed by the Independent Television Authority  ITA   which also saw the use of VHF Band III  This was the sole system in existence until the preparations for the introduction of     line transmission in      and was put out of use at the start of             line system edit   System I     lines  Bands IV and

third television service  known as BBC   and with it the introduction of the     line service on UHF Bands IV and V  Whilst the extra lines theoretically offered better resolution and picture clarity  the fledgling network of new transmitters required to provide the service offered far inferior coverage compared with the existing VHF services and was prone to increased interference often resulting in poor picture quality  Furthermore  few people had the new sets required to receive the new service or the different type of aerial required to pick up the UHF signal   Colour edit  During the late     s  when the decision to introduce colour television was first seriously mooted  the then two main systems for consideration were the French SECAM and American NTSC systems  the latter generally considered superior and expected to be adopted  Throughout the     s a third competing system  PAL  became available and was eventually adopted by the GPO for use on the     line service  to be known as System I or PAL I  Broadcast on this system officially commenced in      with BBC  s  and the UK s  launch of colour television programming  though previous years had seen many unofficial colour test films outside of official broadcasting hours  including some which trialled NTSC and SECAM  BBC  was joined in      by BBC  and the main ITV franchises  the rest following in stages into the     s   Both BBC  and ITV continued to broadcast simultaneously on the VHF system A until       NICAM     Digital stereo edit  Without affecting the definition of the  PAL I  system  the UK also used a digital stereo companding system on analogue terrestrial television called NICAM  Standing for Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex and used for digital stereo TV broadcasts to the public  it used the NICAM digital audio system used since the early     s for transmitting the audio carrier signal of a broadcast between two or more regional broadcasters and sometimes to the transmitters  where it was converted back to an analogue FM audio carrier   MHz above the video carrier signal  Reception of the NICAM signal provided the user had a VCR or a TV capable of decoding the NICAM signal  which was broadcast on a carrier       MHz above the video carrier  and thus just       MHz above the FM mono audio carrier  The first UK NICAM stereo broadcast was made in May      on BBC   NICAM slowly being rolled out across the UK and across the broadcaster s programme schedules over the next   years  culminating in the official launch of NICAM on the BBC in       ITV and Channel   having begun broadcasting NICAM in      and      respectively  The service was sometimes referred to by its full  official  name  NICAM       the     denoting the datarate of the digital stereo information   the datarate was    kbit s  non PCM   Channel allocations edit  The     line system divided the spectrum into    channels        and        Bands IV and V   These channels were allocated  by the GPO  to the broadcasters to allow for four networks to operate with eventual maximum coverage and minimum cross network interference  The two BBC channels and the ITV network were catered for  as well as space for a future fourth network  at the time expected to be a second network for the ITA  The fourth network didn t come into being until the Broadcasting Act      created Channel   and S C  This early provision meant that near complete coverage was afforded to both networks at launch  in       When Channel   launched in      it was allocated UHF channels which were in use by many domestic VCRs  requiring a massive equipment retuning exercise to be undertaken at the broadcaster s expense  Additionally  lack of compatibility with older antennas  plus existing use of the channels by stations in France  meant that Channel   never acquired the level of analogue coverage enjoyed by the other broadcasters  citation needed   Digital switch over edit  Further information  Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom The government was committed to switching terrestrial television broadcasting to fully digital by       The digital network features six multiplexes at each of the    main nodes  at other nodes there is only three multiplexes because fewer broadcasters were interested in the less densely populated regions  A company called Digital UK was set up to handle the change  The switch was on a region by region basis using the ITV regions as a basis  The schedule was announced by Secretary of State for Culture  Media and Sport  Tessa Jowell on    September      Some concern had been raised that the London region would be switched shortly before the city hosts the Olympic Games  Jowell said  I can assure you that I did not slog for two years to bring the games here just to see Londoners reduced to huddling round the wireless to find out who won the hundred metres  I am completely confident that our timetable is a sensible one which will ensure that digital services are delivered with no disruption to the viewing public during the Games themselves      It was also announced that a support scheme would be put in place to ensure that no one is left behind in the switch  It provided help with equipment and installation and follow up support for people aged    years and over and people with significant disabilities  The scheme was funded by the BBC through the licence fee  The final region to switch off was Northern Ireland  on    October       To dedicate the permanent switching off of analogue in Northern Ireland  and  by extension  the United Kingdom  BBC Northern Ireland and UTV together aired  The Magic Box   a programme dedicated to analogue TV  it became the last programme broadcast in analogue in the United Kingdom
