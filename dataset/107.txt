        by Romulo O Farrill  Sr   and owned by Novedades Editores  SA de CV   The News No    had a peak circulation of            Romulo O Farrill Silva             Member of sixth generation O Farrill name in Mexico  He specialized in auto mechanics and organized an auto assembly plant of a short life  The assembly plant was subsequently sold to the Volkswagen Company  He acquired the Novedades newspaper and a radio station  He received the first grant of television in Mexico and Latin America  Channel    starting operations on August           He proposed merging the television channels      and   for profitability reasons leading to the formation of Tele Sistema Mexicano  with the Azcarraga family and Guillermo Gonz lez Camarena as partners   He continued as a major partner of that television company  Due to financial difficulties of the Novedades newspaper  its sister publication The News closed its doors in December        after    years of serving Mexico s English speaking community  At the time of closure  Novedades had about     employees while the much smaller News had less than     The News was reportedly profitable even as it was shutting down      Novedades Editores and Novedades edit  Excerpts from Novedades are cited prolifically in John Womak s biography of Emiliano Zapata  Zapata and the Mexican Revolution  Vintage Books       that is widely considered the best biography on the revolutionary hero  The Spanish language daily created local editions in Acapulco  Cancun and elsewhere  Novedades was instrumental in the launch the first television network in Mexico  which grew into today s powerful Televisa  Novedades Editores  cash cow was the publication of its comic novellas  which are still popular reading material for Mexico s lower classes  The company also had a license to publish a number of high end magazines  such as Vogue  Poor management of the magazines resulted in their closure  In the     s  the popularity of Novedades declined as it was widely considered to be an advocate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party  PRI   Mexico s longest ruling political organ until Vicente Fox s presidential victory in       Novedades faced stiff competition from Reforma  which launched in       and specialized daily publications such as El Economista   The News No               edit  On October       The News began publishing again as a    page daily under the ownership of Mr  O Farrill s son and grandson  Victor Hugo O Farrill Sr  and Victor Hugo O Farrill Jr  That lasted almost two years  until it was sold in May       In explaining why the O Farrill family sold the paper  Victor Jr   said his family lacked the resources necessary to continue running the newspaper  and that  the costs were very high for such a small newspaper      It is noteworthy that not only the editorial was managed with a high standard code of ethics  probably unique to Mexico  but also the design grasped three awards of excellence from the SND s   nd edition  According to  The News  Director Alejandro Envila Fisher  The News No    had at least    contracts with foreign reporters  with little or no advertising revenue      The News No          to Present edit  In May       Mexican media company Grupo Mac purchased The News  the terms of the purchase did not include purchasing the    or so contracts of The News No    The    page paper is now published Monday through Friday  with a    page edition on Friday  Grupo Mac also owns publications Cambio  Rumbo de Mexico and Estadio  and has a national presence via its eight radio stations and state newspapers published in the states of Hidalgo  Quer taro  Toluca and Morelos  The News No    got off to a bumpy start  Its new editor  Malcolm Beith  lasted less than two weeks as he was fired after he published unprofessional editorial content  unsigned  about the former owner  Victor Jr   in its June         edition  on line references     News content today is created with a mix of resources  including The News  own reporters  reporters from Rumbo  Cambio and Estadio and wire services   Staff Memoirs       s      s edit  The English language daily s most important role happened before the growth of the Internet  It was the primary source of English language information  and comics  for ex pats and travelers  Wire service stories from the U S  and elsewhere were the primary sources of news for the niche readership  Roger Toll  the editor during most of the     s  obtained the rights to insert The New York Times Week in Review  which was very popular with readers  From its beginnings in the     s through the late     s  domestic information ranged from national business stories to garden parties hosted by members of the foreign community  Roger Toll also created a weekly supplement called Encuentros  which provided cultural information  The daily newspaper occasionally carried a staff written story from outside the nation s capital  Stringers contributed local stories about ex pats and community activities from Acapulco  San Miguel del Allende  Chapala and elsewhere  Those local stories appeared in the weekly travel supplement called Vistas  which was edited for years by the late Joe Nash and Sally Sue Hulse  Some stories gained more attention  For example  as the air quality declined in Mexico City  The News ran more stories about the smog s impact on the population  This type of reporting  as well as the occasional business piece  earned some respect for the tabloid  The large diplomatic corp in Mexico City read the English language daily carefully and many embassies used clippings in their reports back to their respective home countries  Like its Spanish language sister paper  and many dailies in the nation s capital   The News tended to toe the official government line in its editorial policy  specifically in its national news coverage  Hoping to change that trend  then editor Roger Toll hired Pete Hamill in      to take over The News  Hamill  a former New York Post columnist  was fired after six months on the job for covering a student protest on Mexico City s main university  the UNAM  A few staff members broke away in the late     s and started The Mexico Journal  which was published by the Spanish language daily newspaper La Jornada  The Mexico Journal had great content but it could not generate enough advertising to stay afloat  It closed  leaving The News as the only domestic English language news source  Following Pete Hamill s departure  Novedades promoted business columnist Roberto Mena to take over the daily  Mena stepped down as editor but continued to write his business column  Patricia Nelson  who ran the paper s finance section  took over as editor   During particular hectic periods of the late     s and     s  Nelson acted as interim editor three times while continuing to write her three weekly finance columns   Nelson  Mena and longtime yes man Dan Dial  who eventually climbed into the editor s chair  were among only a few who affixed themselves to The News for any length of time   Staff Memoirs   The News in the Cold War edit  For most of its early life  The News was in the center of the three way struggle to control information going to the expatriate and diplomatic communities in Mexico City  once described as the  Berlin of the West   While Romulo O Farrill  Jr  drove up to the Novedades The News offices his chauffeur driven Lamborghini in the mid     s  The News journalists many of them barely surviving on less than      a month were often easy prey of intelligence agencies on both sides of the conflict  The paper s administration toed the Washington and Institutional Revolutionary Party  PRI  lines  not only for financial and political advantage in the Mexican market  but for self preservation in a media market  pyramid  that was somehow split Left on the bottom and Right on the top with the Right becoming an ever smaller  threatened minority  It was a time to win  the hearts and minds  of young ex pat journalists  so that they  knowingly or not  could convey the  party line   Easy no payback loans were made to pro U S  policy newspapers  while others  particularly in the political opposition or of Leftist bent  struggled to get enough paper from the Mexican government to print  The Soviets  meanwhile  offered the coin of their realm a progressive ideology that bore promise of a better future perfect for young  idealistic journalists  The Soviets  and to a certain extent the Cubans  trusted no one  offering support not as a prelude but  rather  as a postscript  In other words  they basically said   Do something for us  and then we ll see what we can do for you   Their approach  however  caused directly and indirectly the failure and destruction of many friendly journalists and publications  In the political arena  this approach  along with deep infiltration by Mexican military intelligence  contributed to the disappearance or destruction of many in Leftist political groups  Throughout The News history  the O Farrill family always maintained ties with Washington  along with bitter memories of its expropriated financial and property loses in the Cuban Revolution  The elder O Farrill  Don Romulo  although rich and powerful  retained a sense of humility  humanity  and grace throughout his long life  He often greeted Novedades and The News employees by name as he entered the Balderas building s main elevator  And although apparently somewhat embittered  he seldom demonstrated it in public  preferring instead to  at least partially  identify with the poor souls around him  His eldest living son  Pepe Antonio  on the other hand  was often aloof and arrogant  with little regard for the workers in his publishing empire  And although The News was an English language newspaper  it was not out of the line of fire  as it was fertile recruitment ground for intelligence assets  The Soviets and Cubans were somewhat reserved in their recruitment of English speaking journalists in Mexico  fearing that they could be Western agents  The Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   however  was much more sophisticated and subtle  having developed their Latin American media campaign from at least the early     s  under the watchful eye of  Daniel James   Co   citation needed  James  a CIA fixture in Mexico City society  had a phony public relations firm that was in constant contact with The News and some of its high ranking editors  He also once had his offices at the Maria Isabel Hotel next door to the U S  Embassy  Earlier in his career  he was  in part  responsible for the propaganda that led to the CIA invasion of Guatemala in       citation needed  Part of his job in Mexico was to recruit U S  and foreign journalists not necessarily as agents but  rather  as assets to be called upon when U S  policy dictated  First  there would be the invitations to parties  shows  lunches and dinners  etc  Then  over time  the journalist would be drawn into the web  usually through offers of scholarships  phony part time jobs  travel and  for many including a few former journalists from The News  positions within Mexican or U S  media  with an open road to promotion and recognition  If journalists were seen as not cooperating  or were not in support of the  party line   their careers and personal lives were often neutralized or completely obliterated by well planted rumors and lies directed at the journalist s credibility and morality  Some managed to survive  Most didn t  citation needed  The Cubans and Russians  meanwhile  used what they considered to be their trump card   their ideology  So The News in the   s and   s maintained a delicate balance between the idealists on one side  some courted by the Russians and Cubans  among others  and the  survivalists   represented by those who were controlled either by fear of losing their jobs because they violated censorship  or by their ambitions fueled by CIA promises of power and  friendship   The greatest struggle  however  was to keep The News a Mexican newspaper  and not as an extension of the U S  Embassy press office  even if the highest levels of management weren t bothered by the prospect  citation needed  They knew who were recruited by the CIA  and shared some of that information with independent journalists  if it benefited their political objectives at the time  Soviet agents  meanwhile  had been employed by Novedades since the     s  quietly monitoring activities and recruiting assets  usually among lower echelon employees  Most CIA recruits were in management  as they were able to hire and fire  and they looked good at cocktail parties   There were some exceptions  of course   Some recruits went on to U S  publications and wire services especially those serving a Hispanic dominated community  like in Miami or along the U S  Mexican border  citation needed   Staff Memoirs   Fidel  Che  and Ra l   at The News edit  In the     s  Jaime Plenn  then managing editor  recalled the days in the mid     s when Fidel Castro and his brother Ra l would come to The News offices almost every day before their return of Cuba to check news wires  During their exile in Mexico  the brothers were known to have worked a couple of blocks away on Avenida Juarez  reportedly taking pictures of tourists to make extra money  When the sun went down  however  their attention returned to politics and news  Plenn said they were  very nice boys   noting that after a while  a woman and another young man would sometimes join the brothers  Although Plenn never identified the pair  he believed the young man to have been Che Guevara and his first wife   They were all very intense   he recalled  Very serious  but also very courteous and warm     They would read every bit of news about Cuba and Latin America     Of course they always asked me for permission to look at the wires  and of course I always gave it to them    Staff Memoirs   Political Stance edit  There were moments when the newspaper opened up  particularly when Mexico was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  with the United States and Canada  In the early     s  with the appointment of a new general manager at Novedades Editores  and following criticism of the English language paper s coverage   another editor was hired  Michael J  Zamba  a Washington  D C   journalist and author of two published books on Mexico  joined the organization in      and immediately made changes to the paper s design and staff  He also oversaw marketing of the daily  He was fired shortly after he took over as editor  Correction  It was Nelson who instituted classes for the staff   Talented writers such as Elizabeth Malkin  Eduardo Garcia  Peter Raeside  Laurence Iliff and others  as well as then first time writers like David Luhnow were brought into the newspaper  More analytical pieces on Mexico were published and the writers were praised for their work  Business coverage was increased  Circulation grew  Nonetheless  Zamba left in frustration in       Novedades Editores couldn t live up to its promises  Zamba started an English language fortnightly magazine called Mexico Insight  which circulated        copies  The magazine lasted for two years  until the transition from President Salinas to President Zedillo was followed by a major devaluation  In       he launched Express  a daily newspaper of The Dallas Morning News that circulated some        copies in six Mexican cities  That daily closed in      as a result of the economic impact of Sept            Long time employee Dial  formerly of Oakland  Calif   took over as the editor of The News in       Dan had worked his way up in the organization and was trusted by the owner  Novedades Editores fired the General Manager of the organization as the owners took more control of the Noveades Editores  operations  Dial kept the peace  ensured the newspaper was published on time and avoided tough stories  During the historic      elections  the publisher banned the publication of photographs of Vicente Fox  the PAN presidential candidate who was contesting the PRI s long standing dominance  Articles on homosexuality  abortion and AIDS were also prohibited  An assistant managing editor  Daniel C Schechter  not to be confused with media writer and filmmaker Danny Schechter  published a front page article from the New York Times  authored by Sam Dillon  on gay rights in Guadalajara  He was fired for the decision to publish this article  but it was a conscious move on his part to break from the prohibition on certain content   Launching pad for correspondents edit  In spite of its censorship  The News was a unique springboard for budding foreign correspondents  a way to immerse in foreign news coverage  The newspaper helped to nurture some well known correspondents  including The Miami Herald reporter Alfonso Chardy   who was key to breaking the Iran Contra scandal in the     s   was another News alum  Other major journalists currently working in international correspondence  including Peter Raeside  also passed through the doors of The News early in their careers  But the paper also harbored its share of journalistic drifters and misfits who used it as little more than financing for their adventures in Mexico  Another paper tries it  The Herald Mexico  published by El Universal circulated in Mexico City  It was published through a joint venture between The Miami Herald and El Universal  It was a much smaller publication than The News and closed on May            See also edit  List of newspapers in Mexico References edit      a b
