       Satellite Instructional Television Experiment  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search  An ISRO technician next to a working model of the solid state television set  designed with NASA assistance  for use in SITE  Image courtesy NASA Satellite Instructional Television Experiment or SITE was an experimental satellite communications project launched in India in       designed jointly by NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization  ISRO   The project made available informational television programs to rural India  The main objectives of the experiment were to educate the financially backward and academically illiterate people of India on various issues via satellite broadcasting  and also to help India gain technical experience in the field of satellite communications  The experiment ran for one year from   August      to    July       covering more than      villages in    districts of six Indian states and territories  Andhra Pradesh  Bihar  Karnataka  Madhya Pradesh  Orissa  Rajasthan   The television programs were produced by All India Radio and broadcast by NASA s ATS   satellite stationed above India for the duration of the project  The project was supported by various international agencies such as the UNDP  UNESCO  UNICEF and ITU  The experiment was successful  as it played a major role in helping develop India s own satellite program  INSAT     The project showed that India could use advanced technology to fulfill the socio economic needs of the country  SITE was followed by similar experiments in various countries  which showed the important role satellite TV could play in providing education   Contents    Background   Objectives   International collaboration   Technical details   Village selection

sought to field test the direct broadcast of television programs to terrestrial receivers via satellite and shortlisted India  Brazil and the People s Republic of China as potential sites to stage the test  The country which would receive these broadcasts would have to be large enough and also close to the equator for testing a direct broadcast satellite  While the communist regime of China was not recognized at the time by the U S   Brazil was also ruled out as its population was concentrated in the cities  affecting the outreach of the broadcast across the country  As a consequence  India emerged as the only suitable candidate  however  its strained relationship with the U S  prevented the U S  government from directly asking for its assistance  preferring India to make the first request for assistance for its own nascent space program     At the same time  India was trying to launch its national space program under the leadership of Vikram Sarabhai  India was interested in the role of satellites for the purpose of communication and asked UNESCO to undertake a feasibility study for a project in that field  Between    November      and   December       UNESCO sent an expert mission to India to prepare a report on a pilot project in the use of satellite communication  The expert panel concluded that the such a project would be feasible  Following the report  a study team of three engineers from India visited USA and France in June       and came to the conclusion that India could meet the technical requirements for the project     Following this  the Indian government set up the National Satellite Communications Group SATCOM in      to look into the possible uses of a synchronous communications satellite for India  This group consisted of representatives from various cabinet ministries  ISRO and All India Radio  AIR  And Doordarshan  The group recommended that India should use the ATS   satellite  a second generation satellite developed by NASA  for an experiment in educational television     Arnold Frutkin  then NASA s director of international programs  arranged to have the Vikram Sarabhai approach NASA for help  Sarabhai saw this as a great opportunity for India to expand its space program and to train Indian scientists and engineers  Consequently  the Indian Department of Atomic Energy and NASA signed an agreement regarding SITE in

Chairman  ISRO   and    July        Start Of SITE   August       Objectives edit  As per the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two countries  the objectives of the project were divided into two parts general objectives and specific objectives  The general objectives of the project were to   gain experience in the development  testing and management of a satellite based instructional television system particularly in rural areas and to determine optimal system parameters  demonstrate the potential value of satellite technology in the rapid development of effective mass communications in developing countries  demonstrate the potential value of satellite broadcast TV in the practical instruction of village inhabitants  and stimulate national development in India  with important managerial  economic  technological and social implications  The primary social objectives from an Indian perspective were to educate the populace about issues related to family planning  agricultural practices and national integration  The secondary objectives were to impart general school and adult education  train teachers  improve other occupational skills and to improve general health and hygiene through the medium of satellite broadcasts  Besides these social objectives  India also wanted to gain experience in all the technical aspects of the system  including broadcast and reception facilities and TV program material  The primary US objective was to test the design and functioning of an efficient  medium power  wide bandspace borne FM transmitter  operating in the         MHz band and gain experience on the utilisation of this space application      International collaboration edit  A joint ISRO NASA working group was established even before the Memorandum of Understanding was signed  This working group studied the possibility of using a communications satellite for TV broadcast in India  After the MoU was signed  many review meetings were held between NASA and ISRO scientists  Indian scientists visited NASA to study front end converters and earth station operations  On India s request  the INTELSAT III and Arvi Earth Station organisation agreed to provide free satellite time for pre SITE testing  The United Nations Development Programme  UNDP  provided assistance of          for setting up the Experimental Satellite Communications Earth Station  ESCES  at Ahmedabad and nominated the International Telecommunications Union  ITU  as the executing agency for this project  The UNDP provided another      million  for setting up a TV studio at Ahmedabad and a TV transmitter at Pij in Kheda district  It also gave assistance for setting up a TV Training Institute to train many of the programme production staff who would join All India Radio to work on SITE  UNESCO was the executing agency for this project  UNICEF contributed to SITE by sponsoring    film modules produced by Shyam Benegal  a noted Indian filmmaker  This resulted in a lot of interaction between filmmakers and folk artists  Shyam Benegal went on to include many of these artists in his children s feature film Charandas Chor             Technical details edit   ATS F coverage of India at     MHz The production of the television programmes was decentralised  with three Base Production Centres located at Delhi  Cuttack and Hyderabad  and an ISRO studio located in Mumbai  Each of the centres had a production studio  three IVC tape recorders  two    mm  projectors  a slide Projector in Telecine and audio equipment like tape desks and turntables  Each centre also had     full fledged synchronised sound camera units  an editing table  Delhi had two  and a film processing plant  There was also a sound dubbing studio equipped with a pilot tone recording plant and an audio mixing console     The television programmes prepared by the Indian government at the four studios were transmitted at   GHz to ATS   from one of two ground stations located in Delhi and Ahmedabad  These signals were then re transmitted at     MHz by the satellite  which were directly received in      villages by community television receivers with   m parabolic antennas  Regular television stations also received the signals and broadcast them to another      villages in the standard VHF television band  Each television signal had two audio channels to carry audio in two major languages of each cluster     This setup was called the Direct Reception System  DRS   Apart from the direct broadcasts  the earth station at Ahmedabad was micro wave linked to the TV transmitter built in the village of Pij  The Delhi studio was linked to the terrestrial TV transmitters of AIR  A receive only station was built in Amritsar and linked to the local TV transmitter     The DRS undertook terrestrial broadcasting for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages  However  it did not provide for small towns where the TV set density was higher than in the villages while not as much as in a city  The concept of a low power limited rebroadcast  LRB  TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations  The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a     m chicken mesh parabolic antenna with a low noise block converter  that served as the front end for a low power TV transmitter at the same location  Two suitable locations  Sambalpur in Orissa     villages  and Muzaffarpur in Bihar      villages   were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems  This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade off between DRS and LRB  However  due to financial constraints  these two LRBs had to be shelved  and instead an LRB was set up at SHAR  Sriharikota       Village selection edit   Centres of Activities for Satellite Instructional Television Experiment As the broadcasting time was limited  it was decided that the direct reception receivers would only be installed in      villages in six regions spread across the country  Technical and social criteria were used to select suitable areas to conduct this experiment      A computer program was specially designed at ISRO to help make this selection  As one of the aims of the experiment was to study the potential of TV as a medium of development  the villages were chosen specifically for their backwardness  According to the      census of India  the states having the most number of backward districts in the country were Orissa  Bihar  Andhra Pradesh  Uttar Pradesh  Rajasthan  Madhya Pradesh  West Bengal and Karnataka  Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were eventually left out  as they were slated to get terrestrial television by the time SITE would end  SITE was launched in twenty districts spread across the other six states  Each of the states thus selected was called a  cluster   In each cluster      districts  each containing around      villages  were identified  Finally  around     villages were chosen in each cluster      Close to     villages selected for SITE did not have electricity in the buildings where the SITE TV sets would be installed  A special project called Operation Electricity was launched to urgently electrify the villages before the start of SITE      villages would have television sets running on solar cells and batteries      These sets were specially designed by Indian engineers with help from NASA       Clusters selected for SITE       Cluster  District  Maintenance centers   Andhra Pradesh  Hyderabad  Hyderabad     Kurnool  Nandyal     Medak  Sangareddy     Mahbubnagar  Nagarkurnool

generation and the programmes were made in consultation with the government  Special committees on education  agriculture  health and family planning identified their own programme priorities and conveyed it to AIR  Two types of programmes were prepared for broadcasting  educational television  ETV  and instructional television  ITV   ETV programmes were meant for school children and focussed on interesting and creative educational programmes  These programmes were broadcast for     hours during school hours  During holidays  this time was used to broadcast Teacher Training Programmes designed to train almost         primary school teachers during the duration of the SITE  The ITV programmes were meant for adult audiences  mainly to those who were illiterate  They were broadcast for     hours during the evenings  The programmes covered health  hygiene  family planning  nutrition  improved practices in agriculture and events of national importance  Thus  the programmes were beamed for four hours daily in two transmissions  The targeted audience was categorised into four linguistic groups Hindi  Oriya  Telugu and Kannada and programmes were produced according to the language spoken in the cluster      Due to linguistic and cultural differences  it was agreed that all core programmes would be cluster specific  and would be in the primary language of the region  A brief commentary giving the gist of the programme would be available on the second audio channel  to keep up the interest of the audience in other language regions  All clusters would also receive    minutes of common programmes  including news  which would be broadcast only in Hindi        An example of a schedule for evening transmission  schedule for   November      March

Karnataka       Short Film          Evaluation edit  The social research and evaluation of SITE was done by ISRO s special SITE Research and Evaluation Cell  REC   The REC consisted of around     persons who were located in each of the SITE clusters  at the SITE studio in Bombay  and at the headquarters of the REC in Ahmedabad  The research design was finalized by the SITE Social Science Research Co ordination Committee under the chairmanship of Dr  M  S  Gore  Director of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Bombay  Impact on primary school children was studied under a joint project involving ISRO and the National Council of Educational Research and Training  NCERT   The overall evaluation design was divided into three stages  The first stage  the formative or input research  was a detailed study of the potential audience  The second stage  process evaluation  was the evaluation carried out during the life time of SITE  This evaluation provided information about the reaction of the villagers to different programmes  The third stage  the summative evaluation  involved a number of different studies to measure the impact of SITE  These included the Impact Survey  Adults  to measure the impact on adults  SITE Impact Survey Children  SIS C  to measure the impact on school children  and the qualitative anthropology study to measure  at a macro level  the change brought by TV in rural society      Besides the social evaluation  a technical evaluation was also carried out to help India develop future systems  All major sub systems of the earth station were tested and evaluated before SITE was launched  This was done firstly using a spacecraft simulator from NASA  then using the Indian Ocean INTELSAT satellite and finally using the ATS    satellite  All the components of the Direct Reception System were also thoroughly tested  The TV set was tested by the British Aircraft Corporation  The   meter antenna was tested thoroughly before deciding on the final design  Data on failure rates was collected and analysis of the first      failures was carried out to help design future DRS systems       Impact edit  As decided in the original agreement  the SITE program ended in July       and NASA shifted its ATS satellite away from India  despite demands from Indian villagers  journalists and others such as noted writer Arthur C  Clarke  who was presented with a SITE television set in Sri Lanka  for NASA to continue the experiment     The SITE transmissions had a very significant impact in the Indian villages  For the entire year  thousands of villagers gathered around the TV set and watched the shows  Studies were conducted on the social impact of the experiment and on viewership trends  It was found that general interest and viewership were highest in the first few months of the program      to     people per TV set  and then declined gradually     to    people per TV set   This decline was due to several factors  including faults developing in the television equipment  failure in electricity supply  and hardware defects  as also the villagers  pre occupation with domestic or agricultural work  Impact on the rural population was highest in the fields of agriculture and family planning  Nearly     of viewers reported themselves amenable to applying the new knowledge gained by them      Similar experiments were conducted in the Appalachian region  Rocky Mountains  Alaska  Canada  China and Latin America in the mid seventies and early eighties  These experiments demonstrated that satellite TV could play a very important role in providing education      Before SITE  the focus was on the use of terrestrial transmission for television signals  But SITE showed that India could make use of advanced technology to fulfill the socio economic needs of the country   This led to an increased focus on satellite broadcasting in India  ISRO began preparations for a country wide satellite system  After conducting several technical experiments  the Indian National Satellite System was launched by ISRO in           The Indian space program remained committed to the goal of using satellites for educational purposes  In September       India launched EDUSAT  which was the first satellite in the world built exclusively to serve the educational sector  EDUSAT is used to meet the demand for an interactive satellite based distance education system for India           References edit  Evaluation Report On Satellite Instructional Television Experiment  SITE   PDF   Planning Commission  India        Retrieved
