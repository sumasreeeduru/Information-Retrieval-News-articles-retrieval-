structured pieces of data  as opposed to news stories  See also Data journalism Communication scholar Wiebke Loosen defines database journalism as  supplying databases with raw material   articles  photos and other content   by using medium agnostic publishing systems and then making it available for different devices       Contents    History and development of database journalism   Difference with data driven journalism   Examples of database journalism   References   See also   History and development of database journalism edit  Computer programmer Adrian Holovaty wrote what is now considered the manifesto of database journalism in September          In this article  Holovaty explained that most material collected by journalists is  structured information  the type of information that can be sliced and diced  in an automated fashion  by computers      For him  a key difference between database journalism and traditional journalism is that the latter produces articles as the final product while the former produces databases of facts that are continually maintained and improved       saw a rapid development in database journalism     A December      investigation by The Washington Post  Fixing DC s schools  aggregated dozens of items about more than     schools in a database that distributed content on a map  on individual webpages or within articles  The importance of database journalism was highlighted when the Knight Foundation awarded            to Adrian Holovaty s EveryBlock project     which offers local news at the level of city block  drawing from existing data  The Pulitzer prize received by the St  Petersburg Times  Politifact in April      has been considered a Color of Money moment by Aron Pilhofer     head of the New York Times technology team  Referring to Bill Dedman s Pulitzer Prize winning articles called The Color of Money  Pilhofer suggested that database journalism has been accepted by the trade and will develop  much like CAR did in the     s and     s  Seeing journalistic content as data has pushed several news organizations to release APIs  including the BBC  the Guardian  the New York Times and the American National Public Radio     By doing so  they let others aggregate the data they have collected and organized  In other words  they acknowledge that the core of their activity is not story writing  but data gathering and data distribution  Beginning with the early years of the   st century  some researchers expanded the conceptual dimension for databases in journalism  and in digital journalism or cyberjournalism     A conceptual approach begins to consider databases as a specificity of digital journalism  expanding their meaning and identifying them with a specific code  as opposed to the approach which perceived them as sources for the production of journalistic stories  that is  as tools  according to some of the systematized studies in the   s   Difference with data driven journalism edit  Data driven journalism is a process whereby journalists build stories using numerical data or databases as a primary material  In contrast  database journalism is an organizational structure for content  It focuses on the constitution and maintenance of the database upon which web or mobile applications can be built  and from which journalists can extract data to carry out data driven stories   Examples of database journalism edit  Early projects in this new database journalism were mySociety in the UK  launched in       and Adrian Holovaty s chicagocrime org  released in          As of       several databases could be considered journalistic in themselves  They include EveryBlock  OpenCorporates  and Govtrack us   References edit      Wiebke Loosen  The
