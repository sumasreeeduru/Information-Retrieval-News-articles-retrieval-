portalvte Economic globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature  with the two others being political globalization and cultural globalization  as well as the general term of globalization     Economic globalization refers to the widespread international movement of goods  capital  services  technology and information  It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national  regional  and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross border movement of goods  services  technologies and capital     Economic globalization primarily comprises the globalization of production  finance  markets  technology  organizational regimes  institutions  corporations  and labour     While economic globalization has been expanding since the emergence of trans national trade  it has grown at an increased rate due to improvements in the efficiency of long distance transportation  advances in telecommunication  the importance of information rather than physical capital in the modern economy  and by developments in science and technology     The rate of globalization has also increased under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization  in which countries gradually cut down trade barriers and opened up their current accounts and capital accounts     This recent boom has been largely supported by developed economies integrating with developing countries through foreign direct investment  lowering costs of doing business  the reduction of trade barriers  and in many cases cross border migration  While globalization has radically increased incomes and economic growth in developing countries and lowered consumer prices in developed countries  it also changes the power balance how   between developing and developed countries and affects the culture of each affected country  And the shifting location of goods production has caused many jobs to cross borders  causing some workers to change careers      Contents    Evolution of globalization      History     Technology     Policy and government     Global actors

globalization edit  Main article  History of globalization History edit  International commodity markets  labor markets  and capital markets make up the economy and define economic globalization     Beginning as early as      BCE  people in Syria were trading livestock  tools  and other items  In Sumer  an early civilization in Mesopotamia  a token system was one of the first forms of commodity money  Labor markets consist of workers  employers  wages  income  supply and demand  Labor markets have been around as long as commodity markets  The first labor markets provided workers to grow crops and tend livestock for later sale in local markets  Capital markets emerged in industries that require resources beyond those of an individual farmer      Technology edit  Globalization is about interconnecting people around the world beyond the physical barrier of geographical boundaries     These advances in economic globalization were disrupted by World War I  Most of the global economic powers constructed protectionist economic policies and introduced trade barriers that slowed trade growth to the point of stagnation     This caused a slowing of worldwide trade and even led to other countries introducing immigration caps  Globalization did not fully resume until the     s  when governments began to emphasize the benefits of trade     Today  follow on advances in technology have led to the rapid expansion of global trade      Three suggested factors accelerated economic globalization  advancement of science and technology  market oriented economic reforms  and contributions by multinational corporations         The      invention of containerized shipping  along with increases in ship sizes  were a major part of the reduction in shipping costs           Policy and government edit  The GATT WTO framework led participating countries to reduce their tariff and non tariff barriers to trade  Governments shifted their economies from central planning to markets  Multinational corporations reorganized production to take advantage of these opportunities  Labor intensive production migrated to areas with lower labor costs  later followed by other functions as skill levels increased  Networks raised the level of wealth consumption and geographical mobility  This highly dynamic worldwide system and powerful ramifications      On    October       the London Stock Exchange enacted newly deregulated rules that enabled global interconnection of markets  with an expectation of huge increases in market activity  This event came to be known as the Big Bang   Global actors edit  International governmental organizations edit  An intergovernmental organization or international governmental organization  IGO  refers to an entity created by treaty  involving two or more nations  to work in good faith  on issues of common interest  IGO s strive for peace  security and deal with economic and social questions     Examples include  The United Nations  The World Bank and on a regional level The North Atlantic Treaty Organization among others   International non governmental organizations  NGOs  edit  Main article  International non governmental organization International non governmental organizations include charities  non profit advocacy groups  business associations  and cultural associations  International charitable activities increased after World War II and on the whole NGOs provide more economic aid to developing countries than developed country governments   Businesses edit  Businesses participate in globalization in a number of different ways   Many businesses now have international supply chains  favoring manufacturing in low cost countries  Some engage in international outsourcing to low wage countries  which involves the contracting out of a business process  e g  payroll processing  claims processing  and operational  and or non core functions  e g  manufacturing  facility management  call center support  to another party  see also business process outsourcing   Multinational corporations have business operations in multiple countries  either simply because they want to sell goods and services into the local market  or because a given country has advantages like natural resources  low wages  low taxes  or a useful talent pool   Migrants edit  International migrants transfer significant amounts of money through remittances to lower income relatives  Communities of migrants in the destination country often provide new arrivals with information and ideas about how to earn money  In some cases  this has resulted in disproportionately high representation of some ethnic groups in certain industries  especially if economy success encourages more people to move from the source country  Movement of people also spreads technology and aspects of business culture  and moves accumulated financial assets   Irreversibility debate edit  According to prominent Chinese economist Gao Shangquan  economic globalization is an irreversible trend due to the fact that world markets are in great need of science and information technologies  With the growing demands of science and technology  Gao states that with world markets take on an  increasing cross border division of labor       However  Princeton University professor Robert Gilpin argues that nations  economic policies have mistakenly slowed their own growth by resisting globalization  showing that globalization is not irreversible      Antonio L  Rappa agrees that economic globalization is reversible and cites International Studies professor Peter J  Katzenstein      However  Thomas Friedman argues in his book The World Is Flat that globalisation is both irreversible and inevitable       Impact edit  Economic growth and poverty reduction edit  Economic growth accelerated and poverty declined globally following the acceleration of globalization  Per capita GDP growth in the post      globalizers accelerated from     percent a year in the     s and     percent a year in the     s to     percent in the     s and     percent in the     s  This acceleration in growth is even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of     percent in the     s to     percent in the     s  Also  the non globalizing developing countries did much worse than the globalizers  with the former s annual growth rates falling from highs of     percent during the     s to only     percent during the     s  This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the     s and     s    out of the    globalizers experienced increases in growth  many of them quite substantial        Growth Rate of Real GDP per capita According to the International Monetary Fund  growth benefits of economic globalization are widely shared   While several globalizers have seen an increase in inequality  most notably China  this increase in inequality is a result of domestic liberalization  restrictions on internal migration  and agricultural policies  rather than a result of international trade      Poverty has been reduced as evidenced by a     percent annual growth in income for the poorest fifth of the population of Malaysia   Even in China  where inequality continues to be a problem  the poorest fifth of the population saw a     percent annual growth in income   In several countries  those living below the dollar per day poverty threshold declined  In China  the rate declined from    to    percent and in Bangladesh the rate dropped from    to    percent  citation needed  when       Globalizers are narrowing the per capita income gap between the rich and the globalizing nations   China  India  and Bangladesh  some of the newly industrialised nations in the world  have greatly narrowed inequality due to their economic expansion       Global supply chain edit  Main article  Global Value Chain The global supply chain consists of complex interconnected networks that allow companies to produce handle and distribute various goods and services to the public worldwide  Corporations manage their supply chain to take advantage of cheaper costs of production  A supply chain is a system of organizations  people  activities  information  and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer  Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources  raw materials  and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer      Supply chains link value chains      Supply and demand can be very fickle  depending on factors such as the weather  consumer demand  and large orders placed by multinational corporations       Labor conditions and environment edit   Race to the bottom  edit  Globalization is sometimes perceived as a cause of a phenomenon called the  race to the bottom  that implies that to minimize cost and increase delivery speed  businesses tend to locate operations in countries with the least stringent environmental and labor regulations  Pressure to do this is increased if competitors lower costs by the same means  This both directly results poor working conditions  low wages  job insecurity  and pollution  but also encourages governments to under regulate in order to attract jobs and economic investment      However  if business demand is sufficiently high  the labor pool in low wage countries becomes exhausted  as has happened in the People s Republic of China      resulting in higher wages due to competition  and more demand from the public for government protection against exploitation and pollution  From      to       wages in China and India have gone up by around        a year       Health risks edit  In developing countries with loose labor regulations  there are adverse health consequences from working long hours and individuals that burden themselves from working within vasts global supply chains      Women in agriculture  for example  are often asked to work long hours handling chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers without any protection      Although both men and women experience shortcomings with health  the final reports stated that women  with the double burden of domestic and paid work experience an increased the risk of psychological distress and suboptimal health  Strazdins concluded that negative work family spillover especially is associated with health problems among both women and men  and negative family work spillover is related to a poorer health status among women       It is common for the work lifestyle to bring forth adverse health conditions or even death due to weak safety measure policies  After the tragic collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh where over     deaths occurred the country has since then made efforts in boosting up their safety policies to better accommodate workers       Mistreatment edit  In developing countries with loose labor regulations and a large supply of low skill  low cost workers  there are risks for mistreatment of some workers  especially women and children      Poor working conditions and sexual harassment are just some of the mistreatment faced by women in the textile supply chain  Marina Prieto Carr n shows in her research in Central America that women in sweatshops are not even supplied with toilet paper in the bathroom everyday  The reason it costs corporations more is because people can not work to their full potential in poor conditions  affecting the global marketplace      Furthermore  when corporations decide to change manufacturing rates or locations in industries that employ more women  they are often left with no job nor assistance  This kind of sudden reduction or elimination in hours is seen in industries such as the textile industry and agriculture industry  both of which employ a higher number of women than men      One solution to mistreatment of women in the supply chain is more involvement from the corporation and trying to regulate the outsourcing of their product       Global labor and fair trade movements edit  Several movements  such as the fair trade movement and the anti sweatshop movement  claim to promote a more socially just global economy  The fair trade movement works towards improving trade  development and production for disadvantaged producers  The fair trade movement has reached     billion US dollars in annual sales     The movement works to raise consumer awareness of exploitation of developing countries   Fair trade works under the motto of  trade  not aid   to improve the quality of life for farmers and merchants by participating in direct sales  providing better prices and supporting the community      Meanwhile  the anti sweatshop movement is to protest the unfair treatment caused by some companies  Various transnational organizations advocate for improved labor standards in developing countries  This including labor unions  who are put at a negotiating disadvantage when an employer can relocate or outsource operations to a different country       Capital flight edit  Main articles  Capital flight and Liquidity crisis See also  Sudden stop  economics   Tax exporting  Capital strike  and Illicit financial flows  The Argentine economic crisis of      caused in a currency devaluation and capital flight which resulted in a sharp drop in imports  Capital flight occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country because of that country s recent increase in unfavorable financial conditions such as taxes  tariffs  labor costs  government debt or capital controls  This is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country or a forced devaluation for countries living under fixed exchange rates  Currency declines improve the terms of trade  but reduce the monetary value of financial and other assets in the country  This leads to decreases in the purchasing power of the country s assets  A      paper published by Global Financial Integrity estimated capital flight to be leaving developing countries at the rate of       billion to    trillion a year       But capital flight also affects developed countries  A      article in The Times reported that hundreds of wealthy financiers and entrepreneurs had recently fled the United Kingdom in response to recent tax increases  relocating to low tax destinations such as Jersey  Guernsey  the Isle of Man and the British Virgin Islands      In May      the scale of Greek capital flight in the wake of the first  undecided  legislative election was estimated at    billion a week      Capital flight can cause liquidity crises in directly affected countries and can cause related difficulties in other countries involved in international commerce such as shipping and finance  Asset holders may be forced into distress sales  Borrowers typically face higher loan costs and collateral requirements  compared to periods of ample liquidity  and unsecured debt is nearly impossible to obtain  Typically  during a liquidity crisis  the interbank lending market stalls   Inequality edit  Main articles  Economic inequality and International inequality While within country income inequality has increased throughout the globalization period  globally inequality has lessened as developing countries have experienced much more rapid growth      Economic inequality varies between societies  historical periods  economic structures or economic systems  ongoing or past wars  between genders  and between differences in individuals  abilities to create wealth      Among the various numerical indices for measuring economic inequality  the Gini coefficient is most often cited    Of the factors influencing the duration of economic growth in both developed and developing countries  income equality has a more beneficial effect than trade openness  sound political institutions  and foreign investment      Economic inequality includes equity  equality of outcome and subsequent equality of opportunity  Although earlier studies considered economic inequality as necessary and beneficial      some economists see it as an important social problem      Early studies suggesting that greater equality inhibits economic growth did not account for lags between inequality changes and growth changes      Later studies claimed that one of the most robust determinants of sustained economic growth is the level of income inequality      International inequality is inequality between countries  Income differences between rich and poor countries are very large  although they are changing rapidly  Per capita incomes in China and India doubled in the prior twenty years  a feat that required     years in the US      According to the United Nations Human Development Report for       for countries at varying levels of the UN Human Development Index the GNP per capita grew between      and      from        to        or      very high human development         to       or      medium  and       to       or      low  PPP   respectively  PPP    purchasing power parity measured in United States dollars       Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising welfare and hence  reduced inequality  According to Martin Wolf  in the developing world as a whole  life expectancy rose by four months each year after      and infant mortality rate declined from     per thousand in      to    in      due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions  Also  adult literacy in developing countries rose from     in      to     in      and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes  Furthermore  the reduction in fertility rates in the developing world as a whole from     births per woman in      to     in      indicates improved education level of women on fertility  and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment      Consequentially  more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor  Thus  despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries  their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole  Economic development spurred by international investment or trade can increase local income inequality as workers with more education and skills can find higher paying work  This can be mitigated with government funding of education     Another way globalization increases income inequality is by increasing the size of the market available for any particular good or service  This allows the owners of companies that service global markets to reap disproportionately larger profits  This may happen at the expense of local companies that would have otherwise been able to dominate the domestic market  which would have spread profits around to a larger number of owners  On the other hand  globalized stock markets allow more people to invest internationally  and get a share of profits from companies they otherwise could not   Resource insecurity edit  Play media A video explaining findings of the study  Water  energy and land insecurity in global supply chains  A systematic  and possibly first large scale  cross sectoral analysis of water  energy and land insecurity in     countries that links national and sector consumption to sources showed that countries and sectors are highly exposed to over exploited  insecure  and degraded such resources  The      study finds that economic globalization has decreased security of global supply chains with most countries exhibiting greater exposure to resource risks via international trade   mainly from remote production sources   and that diversifying trading partners is unlikely to help nations and sectors to reduce these or to improve their resource self sufficiency                   Competitive advantages edit  Businesses in developed countries tend to be more highly automated  have more sophisticated technology and techniques  and have better national infrastructure  For these reasons and sometimes due to economies of scale  they can sometimes out compete similar businesses in developing countries  This is a substantial issue in international agriculture  where Western farms tend to be large and highly productive due to agricultural machinery  fertilizer  and pesticides  but developing country farms tend to be smaller and rely heavily on manual labor  Conversely  cheaper manual labor in developing countries allowed workers there to out compete workers in higher wage countries for jobs in labor intensive industries  As the theory of competitive advantage predicts  instead of each country producing all the goods and services it needs domestically  a country s economy tends to specialize in certain areas where it is more productive  though in the long term the differences may be equalized  resulting in a more balanced economy    Tax havens edit  Main article  Tax haven  The ratio of German assets in tax havens in relation to the total German GDP      The  Big    shown are Hong Kong  Ireland  Lebanon  Liberia  Panama  Singapore  and Switzerland  A tax haven is a state  country or territory where certain taxes are levied at a low rate or not at all  which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion      Individuals and or corporate entities can find it attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation  This creates a situation of tax competition among governments  Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions      Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories  unless limited by previous international treaties  The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions      In its December      report on the use of tax havens by American corporations      the U S  Government Accountability Office regarded the following characteristics as indicative of a tax haven  nil or nominal taxes  lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities  lack of transparency in the operation of legislative  legal or administrative provisions  no requirement for a substantive local presence  and self promotion as an offshore financial center  A      report from the Tax Justice Network estimated that between US    trillion and     trillion is sheltered from taxes in tax havens worldwide      If such hidden offshore assets are considered  many countries with governments nominally in debt would be net creditor nations      However  the tax policy director of the Chartered Institute of Taxation expressed skepticism over the accuracy of the figures      Daniel J  Mitchell of the US based Cato Institute says that the report also assumes  when considering notional lost tax revenue  that      of the money deposited offshore is evading payment of tax      The tax shelter benefits result in a tax incidence disadvantaging the poor      Many tax havens are thought to have connections to  fraud  money laundering and terrorism       Accountants  opinions on the propriety of tax havens have been evolving      as have the opinions of their corporate users      governments          and politicians          although their use by Fortune     companies     and others remains widespread  Reform proposals centering on the Big Four accountancy firms have been advanced      Some governments appear to be using computer spyware to scrutinize corporations  finances        Red  U S  corporate profits after tax  Blue  U S  nonresidential business investment  both as fractions of GDP             Wealth concentration of corporate profits in global tax havens due to tax avoidance spurred by imposition of austerity measures can stall investment  inhibiting further growth      Cultural effects edit  Economic globalization may affect culture  Populations may mimic the international flow of capital and labor markets in the form of immigration and the merger of cultures  Foreign resources and economic measures may affect different native cultures and may cause assimilation of a native people      As these populations are exposed to the English language  computers  western music  and North American culture  changes are being noted in shrinking family size  immigration to larger cities  more casual dating practices  and gender roles are transformed  Yu Xintian noted two contrary trends in culture due to economic globalization      Yu argued that culture and industry not only flow from the developed world to the rest  but trigger an effort to protect local cultures    He notes that economic globalization began after World War II  whereas internationalization began over a century ago      George Ritzer wrote about the McDonaldization of society and how fast food businesses spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world  attracting other places to adopt fast food culture      Ritzer describes other businesses such as The Body Shop  a British cosmetics company  that have copied McDonald s business model for expansion and influence  In           of     or over     of new McDonald s opened outside the US  In       Japan had       McDonald s locations      Global media companies export information around the world  This creates a mostly one way flow of information  and exposure to mostly western products and values  Companies like CNN  Reuters and the BBC dominate the global airwaves with western points of view   Other media news companies such as Qatar s Al Jazeera network offer a different point of view  but reach and influence fewer people       Migration edit   With an estimated     million people living outside their country of origin  International Labour Organization  ILO         international migration has touched the lives of almost everyone in both the sending and receiving countries of the Global South and the Global North       Because of advances made in technology  human beings as well as goods are able to move through different countries and regions with relative ease   See also
