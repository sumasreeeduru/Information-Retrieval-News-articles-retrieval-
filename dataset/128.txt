September           also called the Fair  was Duke of Burgundy from      to      and the first Habsburg King of Castile  as Philip I  for a brief time in       The son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy  Philip was less than four years old when his mother died  and upon her death  he inherited the Burgundian Netherlands  In       his father arranged for him to marry Joanna  the second daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon  Around the same time  Philip s sister Margaret was given in marriage to Joanna s brother John  Prince of Asturias  as part of an agreement between their fathers  After the deaths of her elder siblings John and Isabella and her infant nephew  Miguel da Paz  Prince of Portugal  Joanna became heir presumptive to the thrones of Castile and Aragon  She became Queen of Castile when her mother died in       Philip was proclaimed King in       but died a few months later  leaving his wife distraught with grief  Philip was the first Habsburg monarch in Spain  and is the progenitor of every later monarch of Spain  even up to today  He died before his father  and therefore never inherited his father s territories or became Holy Roman Emperor  However  his son Emperor Charles V eventually united the Habsburg  Burgundian  Castilian  and Aragonese inheritances  Philip holds a special place in Habsburg history because he was the pivot around which the dynasty acquired a large portion of its extensive lands  By inheriting the Burgundian Netherlands and acquiring much of Spain and its possessions in the New World by marriage to Joanna  Philip was instrumental in vastly enhancing the territories of the Habsburgs  and his progeny would dominate European history for the next two centuries  Philip s wife Joanna was an elder sister to Catherine of Aragon  who married successively the brothers Arthur  Prince of Wales  and King Henry VIII of England  Philip did once visit England  and the young Prince Henry was much impressed with him  Indeed  Henry is said to have regarded Philip as providing a model of leadership towards which he aspired       Holland  gold florin  Philippus Goudgulden   struck

wife Mary  Duchess of Burgundy  He was born in the County of Flanders  today in Belgium  during the reign of his grandfather Frederick III  The child was named in honour of his great grandfather  Philip the Good  grandfather of his mother Mary    Philip by the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen Philip was only four years old when his mother died in       resulting in him succeeding her as ruler of the Burgundian possessions under the guardianship of his father  A period of turmoil ensued which witnessed sporadic hostilities between  principally  the large towns of Flanders  especially Ghent and Bruges  and the supporters of Maximilian  During this interregnum  Philip became caught up in events and was even briefly sequestered in Bruges as part of the larger Flemish campaign to support their claims of greater autonomy  which they had wrested from Mary of Burgundy in an agreement known as the Great Privilege of       By the early     s  the turmoil of the interregnum gave way to an uneasy stand off  with neither French support for the cities of the Franc  Flanders   nor Imperial support from Philip s grandfather  Emperor Frederick III proving decisive  Both sides came to terms in the Treaty of Senlis in       when Emperor Frederick died and Philip s father Maximilian became the new emperor  This smoothed over the internal power struggle as the two sides agreed to make the    year old Philip crown prince in the following year    Engraving of Philip I of Castile The Burgundian inheritance and the Spanish alliance edit  In       Maximilian relinquished his regency under the terms of the Treaty of Senlis and Philip  aged     took over the rule of the Burgundian lands himself  although in practice authority was derived from a council of Burgundian notables  On    October       he married Joanna  daughter of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile  in Lier  Belgium     The marriage was one of a set of family alliances between the Habsburgs and the Trast mara  designed to strengthen against growing French power  which had increased significantly thanks to the policies of Louis XI and the successful assertion of regal power after war with the League of the Public Weal  The matter became more urgent after Charles VIII s invasion of Italy  known as the First Peninsular War   Philip s sister Margaret married John  Prince of Asturias  only son of Ferdinand and Isabella and heir apparent to the unified crowns of Castile and Aragon     The double alliance was never intended to let the Spanish kingdoms fall under Habsburg control  At the time of her marriage to Philip  Joanna was third in line to the throne  with John and their sister Isabella married and hopeful of progeny   The Castilian inheritance edit   Joanna of Castile In       shortly after the birth of Joanna and Philip s second child  the future Emperor Charles V   in Flanders  the succession to the Castilian and Aragonese crowns was thrown into turmoil  The heir apparent  John  had died in      very shortly after his marriage to Margaret of Austria  The crown thereby seemed destined to devolve upon his and Joanna s elder sister Isabella  wife of Manuel I of Portugal  She died in       while giving birth to a son named Miguel da Paz  to whom succession to the united crowns of Castile  Aragon and Portugal now fell  however  the infant was sickly and died during the summer of       The succession to the Castilian and Aragonese crowns now fell to Joanna  Because Ferdinand could produce another heir  the Cortes of Aragon refused to recognize Joanna as heir presumptive to the Kingdom of Aragon  In the Kingdom of Castile  however  the succession was clear  Moreover  there was no Salic tradition which the Castilian Cortes could use to thwart the succession passing to Joanna  At this point  the issue of Joanna s supposed mental incompetence moved from courtly annoyance to the center of the political stage  since it was clear that Philip and his Burgundian entourage would be the real power holders in Castile  In       Philip  Joanna and a large part of the Burgundian court travelled to Spain to receive fealty from the Cortes of Castile as heirs  a journey chronicled in intense detail by Antoon I van Lalaing  French  Antoine de Lalaing   the future Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland  Philip and the majority of the court returned to the Low Countries in the following year  leaving a pregnant Joanna behind in Madrid  where she gave birth to Ferdinand  later Holy Roman Emperor  Although Joanna was deeply in love with Philip  their married life was rendered extremely unhappy by his infidelity and political insecurity  during which time he constantly attempted to usurp her legal birthrights of power  This led in great part to the rumors of her insanity due to reports of depressive or neurotic acts committed while she was being imprisoned or coerced by her husband  rumors that benefited Philip politically  Most historians now agree she was merely clinically depressed at the time  not insane as commonly believed  Before her mother s death  in       husband and wife were already living apart   Struggle for power in Spain edit  In       Philip s mother in law  Queen Isabella of Castile  died  leaving the Crown of Castile to Joanna  Isabella I s widower and former co monarch  King Ferdinand II  endeavored to lay hands on the regency of Castile  but the nobles  who disliked and feared him  forced him to withdraw  Philip was summoned to Spain  where he was recognized as king  However  en route to Spain in January       Philip and Joanna were caught in a tempest and shipwrecked off the Dorset coast  forcing them on shore near Melcombe Regis  The couple stayed as guests of Henry VII of England but were in fact hostages for the duration of their stay  To get released Philip was forced to sign a treaty with Henry VII the so called Malus Intercursus which included a mutual defense pact  the extradition of rebels  including the Earl of Suffolk  Edmund de la Pole  who as an exile was a guest of Philip in the Low Countries  and a trade agreement which allowed English merchants to import cloth duty free into the Low Countries  After handing over Edmund  Philip and Joanna were allowed to leave England after a stay of six weeks     Philip and Joanna landed at Corunna on    April       accompanied by a body of German mercenaries  Father  and son in law mediated under Cardinal Cisneros at Remesal  near Puebla de Sanabria  and at Renedo  the only result of which was an indecent family quarrel  in which Ferdinand professed to defend the interests of his daughter  who he said was imprisoned by her husband  In meetings between    and    June  mediated by Cardinal Cisneros  the senior churchman in Spain  Ferdinand accepted that his  most beloved children   Joanna and Philip  should take over control of Castile     The two kings then agreed that Juana was neither fit nor inclined to rule  considering her infirmities and sufferings  which for the sake of honour are not expressed  and further that if  the said most serene Queen  either from her own choice or from being persuaded by other persons should attempt to meddle in the government both would prevent it   It suited both her father and her husband that she be regarded as incapable  On    June       the Treaty of Villaf fila was signed between Ferdinand and Philip  with Philip being proclaimed King of Castile by the Cortes of Valladolid  Yet on the same day Ferdinand drew up secret documents repudiating all the agreements on the grounds of coercion  claiming that he would never otherwise have signed treaties that did  such enormous damage to the said most serene Queen  my daughter  and me   Having left his options for the future open  he departed for Aragon     However  Philip died suddenly at Burgos  apparently of typhoid fever     on    September       although a poisoning  assassination  was widely spoken of at the time     and is what his wife believed to be the cause of Philip s death  His wife supposedly refused to allow his body to be buried or part from it for a while  Philip I is entombed at the Royal
