South Wales  and the most populous city in Oceania     Located on Australia s east coast  the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about    km       mi  on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west  Hawkesbury to the north  the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south west     Sydney is made up of     suburbs  spread across    local government areas  Informally there are at least    regions  Residents of the city are known as  Sydneysiders      As of June       Sydney s estimated metropolitan population was               meaning the city is home to approximately     of the state s population      Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least        years  and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region  making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites  During his first Pacific voyage in       Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia  making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area  In       the First Fleet of convicts  led by Arthur Phillip  founded Sydney as a British penal colony  the first European settlement in Australia  Phillip named the settlement after Thomas Townshend   st Viscount Sydney      Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in       A gold rush occurred in the colony in       and over the next century  Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre  After World War II  it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world     At the time of the      census  more than     different languages were spoken in Sydney      In the      Census  about       of residents spoke a language other than English at home      Furthermore        of the population reported having been born overseas  and the city has the third largest foreign born population of any city in the world after London and New York City          Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world      Sydney frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities in the world              It is classified as an Alpha Global City by Globalization and World Cities Research Network  indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world          Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity      Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in finance  manufacturing and tourism          There is a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations in Sydney and the city is promoted as Australia s financial capital and one of Asia Pacific s leading financial hubs          Established in       the

Sydney First inhabitants edit   Charcoal drawing of kangaroos in Heathcote National Park  The first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were indigenous Australians who had migrated from northern Australia and before that from southeast Asia  While radiocarbon dating has shown evidence of human activity in the Sydney area from around        years ago      Aboriginal stone tools found in Western Sydney s gravel sediments indicate there was human settlement in the region from as far back as        to        years BP      The first meeting between the native people and the British occurred on    April      when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay on the Kurnell Peninsula and encountered the Gweagal clan              He noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors      Cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement  He spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of Australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for Britain  Prior to the arrival of the British there were       to       native people in Sydney from as many as    different clans      The earliest British settlers called the natives Eora people   Eora  is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the British  Its literal meaning is  from this place       Sydney Cove from Port Jackson to Petersham was inhabited by the Cadigal clan      The principal language groups were Darug  Guringai  and Dharawal  The earliest Europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing  using trees for bark and food  collecting shells  and cooking fish       Establishment of the colony edit   The Founding of Australia     January       by Captain Arthur Phillip R N   Sydney Cove  Painting by Algernon Talmage  Britain before that  England and Ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the Atlantic to the American colonies  That trade was ended with the Declaration of Independence by the United States in       Britain decided in      to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by Cook some    years earlier      Captain Phillip led the First Fleet of    ships and about     convicts into Botany Bay on    January       though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water  He travelled a short way further north and arrived at Sydney Cove on    January               This was to be the location for the new colony  Phillip described Port Jackson as being  without exception the finest harbour in the world       The colony was at first to be titled  New Albion   after Albion  another name for Great Britain   but Phillip decided on  Sydney  The official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on   February       Lieutenant William Dawes produced a town plan in      but it was ignored by the colony s leaders  Sydney s layout today reflects this lack of planning      Between      and             male and     female convicts were landed at Sydney many  professional criminals  with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony  The food situation reached crisis point in       Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce  From      on  however  the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies      The colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity  Maps from this time show no prison buildings  the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration  but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging      Phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils and fixed on the Parramatta region as a promising area for expansion and moved many of the convicts from late      to establish a small township  which became the main centre of the colony s economic life  leaving Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life  Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and Toongabbie  but a building programme  assisted by convict labour  advanced steadily        Thomas Watling s View of Sydney Cove  circa           Officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land      The region s indigenous population was also suffering  It is estimated that half of the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of               Enlightened for his age  Phillip s personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony  Phillip and several of his officers   most notably Watkin Tench   left behind journals and accounts which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement      Part of Macquarie s effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re enter society as free citizens      Roads  bridges  wharves  and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by      the town had banks  markets  and well established thoroughfares  Parramatta Road was opened in       which is one of Sydney s oldest roads and Australia s first highway between two cities   Sydney  present day city centre  and Parramatta      Conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis  but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade  such as wool  helped to lessen the burden of isolation      Between      and       convicts and their jailers made up the majority of the population  in one generation  however  a population of emancipated convicts who could be granted land began to grow  These people pioneered Sydney s private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired  and later still by free settlers who began arriving from Britain  Governor Phillip departed the colony for England on    December       with the new settlement having survived near starvation and immense isolation for four years       Conflicts edit   The Castle Hill convict rebellion of       Between      and       Sydney became one of the many sites of the Australian Frontier Wars  a series of conflicts between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the resisting Indigenous clans      In       when the British established farms along the Hawkesbury River  an Aboriginal leader Pemulwuy resisted the Europeans by waging a guerrilla style warfare on the settlers in a series of wars known as the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars which took place in western Sydney  He raided farms until Governor Macquarie dispatched troops from the British Army   th Regiment in      and ended the conflict by killing    Indigenous Australians in a raid on their campsite          In       Irish convicts led the Castle Hill Rebellion  a rebellion by convicts against colonial authority in the Castle Hill area of the British colony of New South Wales  The first and only major convict uprising in Australian history suppressed under martial law  the rebellion ended in a battle fought between convicts and the colonial forces of Australia at Rouse Hill      The Rum Rebellion of      was the only successful armed takeover of government in Australian history  where the Governor of New South Wales  William Bligh  was ousted by the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston  who led the rebellion  Conflicts arose between the governors and the officers of the Rum Corps  many of which were land owners such as John Macarthur   Modern development edit    th century edit   Aerial illustration of Sydney       Early Sydney was moulded by the hardship suffered by early settlers  In the early years  drought and disease caused widespread problems  but the situation soon improved  The military colonial government was reliant on the army  the New South Wales Corps  Macquarie served as the last autocratic Governor of New South Wales  from      to      and had a leading role in the social and economic development of Sydney which saw it transition from a penal colony to a budding free society  He established public works  a bank  churches  and charitable institutions and sought good relations with the Aborigines    Victorian Sydney Over the course of the   th century Sydney established many of its major cultural institutions  Governor Lachlan Macquarie s vision for Sydney included the construction of grand public buildings and institutions fit for a colonial capital  Macquarie Street began to take shape as a ceremonial thoroughfare of grand buildings  The year      was the final year of convict transportation to Sydney  which by this time had a population of                 Gold was discovered in the colony in      and with it came thousands of people seeking to make money          Sydney s population reached         by      and during this time the city entered a period of prosperity which was reflected in the construction of grand edifices  Temperance coffee palaces  hotels as well as other civic buildings such as libraries and museums were erected in the city              Demand for infrastructure to support the growing population and subsequent economic activity led to massive improvements to the city s railway and port systems throughout the     s and     s      After a period of rapid growth  further discoveries of gold in Victoria began drawing new residents away from Sydney towards Melbourne in the     s  which created a historically strong rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne              Nevertheless  Sydney exceeded Melbourne s population in the early twentieth century and remains Australia s largest city         Following the depression of the     s  the six colonies agreed to form the Commonwealth of Australia  Sydney s beaches had become popular seaside holiday resorts  but daylight sea bathing was considered indecent until the early   th century         th century present edit   A tram car on George Street in       Sydney once had one of the largest tram networks in the British Empire  Under the reign of Queen Victoria federation of the six colonies occurred on   January       Sydney  with a population of          then became the state capital of New South Wales  The Great Depression of the     s had a severe effect on Sydney s economy  as it did with most cities throughout the industrial world  For much of the     s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed      Construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge served to alleviate some of the effects of the economic downturn by employing       men between      and           The population continued to boom despite the Depression  having reached   million in           The city had one of the largest tram networks in the British Empire until it was dismantled in         Sydney Harbour Bridge opening day    March      When Britain declared war on Germany in       Australia also entered  During the war Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a wartime economy  Far from mass unemployment  there were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles  Sydney s harbour was attacked by the Japanese in May and June      with a direct attack from Japanese submarines with some loss of life      Households throughout the city had built air raid shelters and performed drills  Consequently  Sydney experienced population growth and increased cultural diversification throughout the post war period  The people of Sydney warmly welcomed Queen Elizabeth II in      when the reigning monarch stepped onto Australian soil for the first time to commence her Australian Royal Tour      Having arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia through Sydney Heads  Her Majesty came ashore at Farm Cove  There were     million people living in Sydney at      and almost   million by       The Australian government launched a large scale multicultural immigration program    Sydney hosted the      Summer Olympics  New industries such as information technology  education  financial services and the arts have risen  Sydney s iconic Opera House was opened in      by Her Majesty  A new skyline of concrete and steel skyscrapers swept away much of the old lowrise and often sandstone skyline of the city in the     s and     s  with Australia Square being the tallest building in Sydney from its completion in      until      and is also notable for being the first skyscraper in Australia      This prolific growth of contemporary high rise architecture was put in check by heritage laws in the     s onwards  which prevent demolition of any structure deemed historically significant  Since the     s Sydney has undergone a rapid economic and social transformation  As a result  the city has become a cosmopolitan melting pot  To relieve congestion on the Sydney Harbour Bridge  the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened in August       The      Summer Olympics were held in Sydney and became known as the  best Olympic Games ever  by the President of the International Olympic Committee      Sydney has maintained extensive political  economic and cultural influence over Australia as well as international renown in recent decades  Following the Olympics  the city hosted the      Rugby World Cup  the APEC Australia      and Catholic World Youth Day       led by Pope Benedict XVI    Geography edit  Main article  Geography of Sydney Topography edit   Sydney lies on a submergent coastline where the ocean level has risen to flood deep rias  Sydney is a coastal basin with the Tasman Sea to the east  the Blue Mountains to the west  the Hawkesbury River to the north  and the Woronora Plateau to the south  The inner city measures    square kilometres     square miles   the Greater Sydney region covers        square kilometres        square miles   and the city s urban area is       square kilometres      square miles  in size              Sydney spans two geographic regions  The Cumberland Plain lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat  The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys  The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew  It was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated  Seventy beaches can be found along its coastline with Bondi Beach being one of the most famous  The Nepean River wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching Broken Bay  Most of Sydney s water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River  The Parramatta River is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney s western suburbs into Port Jackson  The southern parts of the city are drained by the Georges River and the Cooks River into Botany Bay  According to calculations by the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT         of Sydney is covered by trees  making it the third largest city in the world with the most trees after Singapore and Oslo  respectively  tying with Vancouver           Geology edit   Almost all of the exposed rocks around Sydney are Sydney sandstone  Sydney is made up of mostly Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks  The Sydney Basin was formed when the Earth s crust expanded  subsided  and filled with sediment in the early Triassic period      The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed there by rivers from the south and northwest  and laid down between     and     million years ago  The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds      The Sydney Basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs  beaches  and estuaries  Deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the Triassic period in the Hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region where Sydney now lies  The rising sea level between        and       years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours      Port Jackson  better known as Sydney Harbour  is one such ria      Sydney features two major soil types  sandy soils  which originate from the Hawkesbury sandstone  and clay  which are from shales and volcanic rocks   though some soils may be a mixture of the two      Directly overlying the older Hawkesbury sandstone is the Wianamatta shale  a geological feature found in western Sydney that was deposited in connection with a large river delta during the Middle Triassic period which shifted over time from west to east  The Wianamatta shale generally comprises fine grained sedimentary rocks such as shales  mudstones  ironstones  siltstones and laminites  with less common sandstone units      The Wianamatta Group is made up of the following units  listed in stratigraphic order   Bringelly Shale  Minchinbury Sandstone and Ashfield Shale       Ecology edit  Further information  Ecology of Sydney  Typical grassy woodland in the Sydney area  The most prevalent plant communities in the Sydney region are open grassy woodlands     and some pockets of dry sclerophyll forests      which consist of eucalyptus trees  casuarinas  melaleucas  corymbias and angophoras  with shrubs  typically wattles  callistemons  grevilleas and banksias   and a semi continuous grass in the understory      The plants in this community tend to have rough and spiky leaves  as they re grown in areas with low soil fertility  Sydney also features a few areas of wet sclerophyll forests which are found in the wetter  elevated areas in the north and the northeast  These forests are defined by straight  tall tree canopies with a moist understory of soft leaved shrubs  tree ferns and herbs      Sydney is home to dozens of bird species      which commonly include the Australian raven  Australian magpie  crested pigeon  noisy miner and the pied currawong  among others  Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the common myna  common starling  house sparrow and the spotted dove      Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks          Sydney has a few mammal and spider species  such as the grey headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel web  respectively          and has a huge diversity of marine species inhabiting its harbour and many beaches       Climate edit  Main article  Climate of Sydney   Sydney  New South Wales  Climate chart  explanation    J F M

a humid subtropical climate  Cfa       The Australian Bureau of Statistics describes the summers as  warm  and  sometimes hot   and the winters as  cool   with uniform rainfall throughout the year      At Sydney s primary weather station at Observatory Hill  extreme temperatures have ranged from       C         F  on    January      to      C        F  on    June                   An average of      days a year have temperatures at or above     C      F  in the central business district  CBD       In contrast  the metropolitan area averages between    and    days  depending on the suburb       The highest minimum temperature recorded at Observatory Hill is       C      F   on   February       while the lowest maximum temperature is      C      F   recorded on    July           The hottest day in the Sydney metropolitan area occurred in Penrith on   January       where a high of       C         F  was recorded       The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from       C        F  in September to       C        F  in February       Sydney has an average of     hours of sunshine per day      and       clear days annually       The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean  and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs      Sydney experiences an urban heat island effect       This makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat  including coastal suburbs            In late spring and summer  temperatures over     C      F  are not uncommon       though hot  dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster       a powerful southerly that brings gale winds and a rapid fall in temperature       Since Sydney borders the Great Dividing Range  it can occasionally experience dry  westerly F hn like winds usually between winter and spring  as it lies on the leeward side of the ranges  thereby elevating fire danger in the region            Due to the inland location  frost is recorded early in the morning in Western Sydney a few times in winter  Autumn and spring are the transitional seasons  with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn       The Bureau of Meteorology reported that      to      were the warmest summers in Sydney since records began in            The summer of          however  proved to be the coolest since         and is the only summer this century to be at or below average in temperatures       In       dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards eastern Australia            The El Ni o Southern Oscillation  the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode           play an important role in determining Sydney s weather patterns  drought and bushfire on the one hand  and storms and flooding on the other  associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation  Many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires  which tend to occur during the spring and summer              A summer thunderstorm over the city taken from Potts Point        The rainfall has a moderate to low variability and it is spread through the months  though it has been erratic in recent times            Even in its months of highest rainfall  Sydney has relatively few rainy days  with an average mean of   to   rainy days per month on the   mm       in  threshold  Precipitation is usually higher in late summer through to early winter when the subtropical ridge is to the south of Australia  permitting easterly winds to dominate  and lower in late winter to early spring when the subtropical ridge is to the north  as it brings dry winds from the continent s interior towards the city  since it rotates counter clockwise                     From      to       Sydney received around    thunderstorms per year       In late autumn and winter  east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall  especially in the CBD       In spring and summer  black nor easters are usually the cause of heavy rain events  though other forms of low pressure areas may also bring heavy deluge and afternoon thunderstorms       Depending on the wind direction  summer weather may be humid or dry  with the late summer autumn period having a higher

of its kind in Australia The motor vehicle  more than any other factor  has determined the pattern of Sydney s urban development since World War II       The growth of low density housing in the city s outer suburbs has made car ownership necessary for hundreds of thousands of households  The percentage of trips taken by car has increased from     in      to     in      and to     in            The most important roads in Sydney were the nine Metroads  including the     kilometre     mile  Sydney Orbital Network  Widespread criticism over Sydney s reliance on sprawling road networks  as well as the motor vehicle  have stemmed largely from proponents of mass public transport and high density housing                 The Light Horse Interchange in western Sydney is the largest in the southern hemisphere       There can be up to         cars using Sydney s roads simultaneously during peak hour  leading to significant traffic congestion             of Sydney households own a motor

public transport for travel to work of any Australian capital city        Buses edit  Main article  Buses in Sydney Bus services today are conducted by a mixture of Government and private operators  In areas previously serviced by trams the government State Transit Authority operates  in other areas  there are private  albeit part funded by the state government  operators  Integrated tickets called Opal cards operate on both government and private bus routes  State Transit alone operated a fleet of       buses and serviced over     million passengers during       In total  nearly     million boardings were recorded across the bus network      NightRide is a nightly bus service that operate between midnight and  am  also replacing trains for most of this period   Trams and light rail edit  Main article  Light rail in Sydney  The CBD and South East Light Rail connects Sydney s CBD with the South Eastern suburbs Sydney once had one of the largest tram networks in the British Empire after London       It served routes covering     kilometres      miles   The internal combustion engine made buses more flexible than trams and consequently more popular  leading to the progressive closure of the tram network with the final tram operating in            From      there were     buses across Sydney carrying    million passengers per annum       In       the Inner West Light Rail  also known as the Dulwich Hill Line  opened between Central station and Wentworth Park  It was extended to Lilyfield in      and then Dulwich Hill in       It links the Inner West and Darling Harbour with Central station and facilitated     million journeys in the         financial year       A second  the CBD and South East Light Rail    km      mi  line serving the CBD and south eastern suburbs opened partially in December      and the remainder in April            A light rail line serving Western Sydney has also been announced  due to open in        Trains edit  Main article  Railways in Sydney  A Sydney Trains service at Ashfield station Sydney Trains is the suburban rail service  Its tracks form part of the New South Wales railway network  It serves     stations across the city and had an annual ridership of     million passenger journeys in               Sydney s railway was first constructed in      with progressive extension to the network to serve both freight and passengers across the city  suburbs  and beyond to rural New South Wales  The main station is the Central railway station in the southern part of the CBD  In the     s and     s the railway reached areas that are now outer suburbs of Sydney       Sydney Metro  a driverless rapid transit system separate from the suburban commuter network  commenced operation in  May       and will be extended into the city and down southwest by      and through the inner west to Parramatta by                  It currently serves    stations  A line to serve the greater west is planned for      and will include a station for the second international airport   Ferries edit  Main articles  Sydney Ferries  List of Sydney Harbour ferries  and Timeline of Sydney Harbour ferries At the time the Sydney Harbour Bridge opened in       the city s ferry service was the largest in the world       Patronage declined from    million passengers in      to    million in      but has recovered somewhat in recent years       From its hub at Circular Quay the ferry network extends from Manly to Parramatta        Airports edit  Sydney Airport  officially  Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport   is located in the inner southern suburb of Mascot with two of the runways going into Botany Bay  It services    international and    domestic destinations      As the busiest airport in Australia it handled      million passengers in      and         tonnes of freight in           It has been announced that a new facility named Western Sydney Airport will be constructed at Badgerys Creek from      at a cost of      billion       Bankstown Airport is Sydney s second busiest airport  and serves general aviation  charter and some scheduled cargo flights  Bankstown is also the fourth busiest airport in Australia by number of aircraft movements       Port Botany has surpassed Port Jackson as the city s major shipping port  Cruise ship terminals are located at Sydney Cove and White Bay   Environmental issues and pollution reduction edit  Main article  Environmental issues in Australia Further information  Climate change in Australia and Renewable energy in Australia  George Street  blanketed by smoke from the bushfires in December      As climate change  greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for Australia  Sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution  cutting back on emissions and maintaining water quality       Since       there have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in the Sydney metropolitan region  The development led to the release of the Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme  MAQS   which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in Sydney  allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution       The         Australian bushfire season significantly impacted outer Sydney  and consequently dramatically reduced the air quality of the Sydney metropolitan area leading to a smoky haze that has lingered for many days throughout December  The air quality was    times the hazardous level in some days            even making it worse than New Delhi s       where it was also compared to  smoking    cigarettes  by Associate Professor Brian Oliver  a respiratory diseases scientist at the University of Technology Sydney       Australian cities are some of the most car dependent cities in the world       especially by world city standards  although Sydney s is the lowest of Australia s major cities at           Furthermore  the city also has the highest usage of public transport in an Australian city  at     making it comparable with New York City  Shanghai and Berlin  Despite its high ranking for an Australian city  Sydney has a low level of mass transit services  with a historically low density layout and significant urban sprawl  thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency            Strategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit       initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of    new Nissan LEAF electric cars  the largest order of the pollution free vehicle in Australia       Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide  gases which contribute to climate change            Cycling trips have increased by      across Sydney s inner city since March       with about       bikes passing through top peak hour intersections on an average weekday       Transport developments in the north west and east of the city have been designed to encourage the use of Sydney s expanding public transportation system  The City of Sydney became the first council in Australia to achieve formal certification as carbon neutral in                 The city has reduced its      carbon emissions by    and since      has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to                The City of Sydney introduced a Sustainable Sydney      program  with various targets planned and a comprehensive guide on how to reduce energy in homes and offices within Sydney by                Reductions in energy consumption have slashed energy bills by     million a year       Solar panels have been established on many CBD buildings in an effort to minimise carbon pollution by around       tonnes a year       The city also has an  urban forest growth strategy   in which it aims to regular increase the tree coverage in the city by frequently planting trees with strong leaf density and vegetation to provide cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather  thus lowering city temperatures       Sydney has also become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy efficient  The One Central Park development  completed in       is an example of this implementation and design                       Utilities edit   Warragamba Dam is Sydney s largest water supply dam  Obtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times  A catchment called the Tank Stream sourced water from what is now the CBD but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the     s       The Botany Swamps Scheme was one of several ventures during the mid     s that saw the construction of wells  tunnels  steam pumping stations  and small dams to service Sydney s growing population       The first genuine solution to Sydney s water demands was the Upper Nepean Scheme which came into operation in      and cost over    million  It transports water     kilometres     miles  from the Nepean  Cataract  and Cordeaux rivers and continues to service about     of Sydney s total water needs       Dams were built on these three rivers between      and            In      the Shoalhaven Scheme brought several more dams into service       The WaterNSW now manages eleven major dams  Warragamba one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world       Woronora  Cataract  Cordeaux  Nepean  Avon  Wingecarribee Reservoir  Fitzroy Falls Reservoir  Tallowa  the Blue Mountains Dams  and Prospect Reservoir       Water is collected from five catchment areas covering        square kilometres        square miles  and total storage amounts to     teralitres      cubic miles        The Sydney Desalination Plant came into operation in            The two distributors which maintain Sydney s electricity infrastructure are Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy            Their combined networks include
