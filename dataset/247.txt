any person with the appropriate receiving equipment to receive the signal and view or listen to the content without requiring a subscription  other ongoing cost  or one off fee  e g   Pay per view   In the traditional sense  this is carried on terrestrial radio signals and received with an antenna  FTA also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription is expected  even though they may be delivered to the viewer listener by another carrier for which a subscription is required  e g   Cable television  the Internet  or satellite  These carriers may be mandated  or OPT  in some geographies to deliver FTA channels even if a premium subscription is not present  providing the necessary equipment is still available   especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for emergency broadcasts  similar to the             emergency service provided by mobile phone operators and manufacturers  On the other side  free to view  FTV  is generally available without subscription  but it is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically  Free to air is often used for international broadcasting  making it something of a video equivalent to shortwave radio  Most FTA retailers list free to air channel guides and content available in North America for free to air use   Contents    Funding   Middle East      Israel     Africa      South

commonly described as free  the cost of free to air services is met through various means   Tax payer funding with an enforced levy of a licence fee for transmission and production costs  e g   the BBC  with a voluntary donation for local transmission and production costs  e g   PBS  with commercial advertising for transmission and production costs and surplus revenues returned to the government  e g   CBC Television T l vision de Radio Canada in Canada  SBS in Australia and TVNZ in New Zealand  Commercial sponsorship Consumer products and services where part of the cost goes toward television advertising and sponsorship  in the case of Japanese television broadcasters like TV Asahi and TV Tokyo which rely heavily on sponsorship  similar to Philippine broadcasters like ABS CBN  TV  and GMA  Middle East edit  Israel edit  Up until       Israel had several free to air channels  The major ones rating wise  Channel    Channel     and Channel    The other ones were  Educational  Channel     and Knesset     Since       Israel has several new free to air channels that replace their older counterparts  The major ones rating wise  Channel     Channel     Kan     and Channel     The other ones are  Kan Educational  Makan     and Knesset Channel   Africa edit  South Africa edit  In       the SABC was finally allowed to introduce a television service  Initially  the proposal was for two television channels  one in English and Afrikaans  aimed at white audiences  and another  known as TV Bantu  aimed at black viewers  However  when television was finally introduced  there was only one channel with airtime divided evenly between English and Afrikaans  alternating between the two languages  Test transmissions in Johannesburg began on   May       followed in July by ones in Cape Town and Durban  Nationwide services finally commenced on   January       In common with most of Western Europe  South Africa used the PAL system for colour television  being only the second terrestrial television service in sub Saharan Africa to launch with a colour only service  Zanzibar in Tanzania having introduced the first such service in        Tanzania itself did not establish a television service until the early     s  similarly concerned about the expense and perceived threat to cultural norms   The Government  advised by SABC technicians  took the view that colour television would have to be available so as to avoid a costly migration from black and white broadcasting technology  Initially  the TV service was funded entirely through a licence fee as in the UK  charged at R    However  advertising began on   January       On   January       two services were introduced  TV  broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV  broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana  aimed at a black urban audience  In       a new service called TV  was introduced  carrying sports and entertainment programming  using the channel shared by TV  and TV   which ended transmissions at      pm  In       TV   TV  and TV  were combined into a new service called CCV  Contemporary Community Values   A third channel was introduced known as TSS  or Topsport Surplus  Topsport being the brand name for the SABC s sport coverage  but this was replaced by NNTV  National Network TV   an educational  non commercial channel  in       The main channel  now called TV   was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans  as before  It also became available in Walvis Bay  an enclave of South Africa in Namibia  which was itself then under South African administration  with a live feed of the channel broadcast via Intelsat being retransmitted on a local low power repeater  In       the SABC s monopoly was challenged by the launch of a subscription based service known as M Net  backed by a consortium of newspaper publishers on   October  However  as part of its licensing restrictions  it could not broadcast news programmes  which were still the preserve of the SABC  although M Net started broadcasting a current affairs programme called Carte Blanche in       As the state controlled broadcaster  the SABC was accused of bias towards the apartheid regime  giving only limited coverage to opposition politicians   Asia edit  Hong Kong edit  In Hong Kong  the largest and most dominant television channel  Television Broadcasts Limited  was the first free to air commercial television channel when it commenced broadcasting on    November       It may also well be among the oldest and first station to broadcast over the air in East and Southeast Asia  ViuTV and RTHK TV

digital television service for all free to air networks would be scheduled before the year       followed by the end of analog television broadcasting   Europe edit  Satellite edit  See also  List of free to air channels at    E European countries have a tradition of most television services being free to air  Germany  in particular  receives in excess of     digital satellite TV channels free to air  Approximately half of the television channels on SES Astra s       east and       east satellite positions  and Eutelsat s Hot Bird      east  are free to air  A number of European channels which one might expect to be broadcast free to air   including many countries  national terrestrial broadcasters   do not do so via satellite for copyright reasons   Rights to purchase programs for free to air broadcast  especially via satellite  are often higher in price than for encrypted broadcast    The lack of FTA among public broadcasters are prevalent in countries whose broadcasters tend to use subtitles for foreign language programmes  although Spain s two public domestic channels  La Una and La Dos  are also encrypted despite dubbed foreign programmes being the norm in Spain   However  these channels usually provide a scheme to offer free  but encrypted  viewing with free to view broadcasts  Certain programming on Italy s RAI  and the majority of Dutch channels are covered by such schemes  although in the case of RAI some programming is transmitted without encryption where there are no copyright issues   In Austria  the main national networks broadcast free to view via satellite  however  all regional and some smaller channels are transmitted free to air  and the national public broadcaster  ORF  offers a special free to air channel which airs selected programming without  i e  those without copyright issues  via satellite all over Europe  As Germany and Austria speak the same language and use the same satellite  Austrian viewers are able to receive about     free German speaking channels from both countries  In general  all satellite radio in Europe is free to air  but the more conventional broadcast systems in use mean that SiriusXM style in car reception is not possible  Cable and satellite distribution allow many more channels to carry sports  movies and specialist channels which are not broadcast as FTA  The viewing figures for these channels are generally much lower than the FTA channels   Terrestrial edit  Various European countries broadcast a large number of channels via free to air terrestrial  generally as an analog PAL

term  council telly  is sometimes used for free to air television in the UK  evoking a basic service accessible to all         North America edit  There are a number of competing systems in use  Early adopters used C band dishes several feet in diameter to receive analog microwave broadcasts  and later digital microwave broadcasts using the         GHz band  Today  although large C band dishes can still receive some content  the           GHz Ku band is also used   Ku band signals can be received using smaller dishes  often as small as under a meter    feet    inches  in diameter  allowing FTA satellite to be picked up from smaller spaces such as apartment balconies  note  however  that these dishes are not quite as small as those commonly used for commercial services such as Dish Network  DirecTV  Bell ExpressVu  Shaw Direct  etc   Dishes intended for those services may not deliver an adequate signal on Ku band   The European developed DVB S and DVB S  standards are the most commonly used broadcast methods  with analog transmissions almost completely discontinued as of mid       The most common North American sources for free to air DVB satellite television are   NHK World HD on

and creates free to air      content on Galaxy       W Most of these signals are carried by US satellites  There is little or no free Canadian DVB S content available to users of medium size dishes as much of the available Ku band satellite bandwidth is occupied by pay TV operators Shaw Direct and Bell Satellite TV  although larger C band dishes can pick up some content  FTA signals may be scattered across multiple satellites  requiring a motor or multiple LNBs to receive everything   This differs from Europe  where FTA signals are commonly concentrated on a few specific satellites  Another difference between North American FTA and FTA in most of the rest of the world is that in North America  very few of the available signals are actually intended for home viewers or other end users   Instead  they are generally intended for reception by local television stations  cable system headends  or other commercial users   While it is generally thought to be legal for home viewers to view such transmissions as long as they are not encrypted  this means that there are several unique challenges to viewing FTA signals  challenges not present in other areas of the world  Among these are   No schedule information is provided with most of the signals  therefore satellite receivers cannot show a proper electronic program guide  EPG   Because many of these broadcasts are essentially point to point transmissions  the originators often do not follow any international standards when setting various identification fields in the data stream   This causes issues with receivers and software designed for use in other parts of the world  as they may assume that if a channel contains the same ID information as another channel  those are duplicate channels   This may be a valid assumption in other parts of the world  but is almost never valid for North American FTA signals   When such an assumption is made  during a  blind scan  the receiver or software will often fail to correctly insert one or more channels into its database  or it may overwrite previously scanned valid channels  including other channels on the same satellite  with invalid information picked up from another  more recently scanned channel   If the end user does not understand what is happening  they may assume that the receiver cannot receive certain channels or that it is defective  yet if the correct data for those channels can be manually entered  those channels may become receivable   This problem can be mitigated if receivers can be set to ignore channels that appear to be duplicates during a  blind scan   except when such channels are on exactly the same satellite and same transponder frequency  as might occur if the user rescans a previously scanned satellite   Channels tend to come and go  or change transmission formats  often without any prior notice other than to their intended recipients   This means that a working channel could suddenly disappear without warning  and may need to be rescanned to become receivable again  or it may be gone permanently  Channels that are currently FTA can become scrambled  encrypted  with no advance warning   A few channels tend to go back and forth between being  in the clear   unscrambled  to scrambled at various times  but in most cases  once a channel is scrambled it stays scrambled  Historically  it has appeared that broadcasters are more likely to scramble their signals when they become aware that home viewers and other  unauthorized  viewers are watching their signals  Therefore  those who know what signals are available may sometimes be reluctant to share that information in open forums   While sites exist that attempt to list currently viewable FTA signals  most of them are incomplete or do not contain current information   Such sites typically rely on reports of changes by viewers  and if viewers are reluctant to report new FTA signals for fear they might disappear  it becomes more of a challenge for such sites to maintain up to date listings  What some would consider the most desirable signals  e g  feeds from broadcast networks  are primarily only available on C band  which requires a large dish  usually at least   feet     meters in diameter or more  although a few hobbyists have found it possible to receive some C band signals using smaller dishes and high quality LNBs    Also some of those signals utilize high bitrate formats that cannot be received by many older receivers  even if those receivers are capable of receiving digital signals  and such signals may require a larger than usual dish for adequate reception   In many areas  local zoning laws and or homeowner associations forbid the placement of a large dish  therefore such dishes have fallen out of favor since commercial satellite services became widely available   Therefore  very few people have the capability to receive the C band broadcasts   Another issue is that properly aiming a C band dish is not something that a typical end user would know how to do  since it tends to be a somewhat complex procedure  especially when a moveable dish is used with the intention of tracking the visible satellite arc in order to receive multiple satellites   and many of the installers that knew how to set up and correctly aim a C band dish have exited the business  While equipment and software is becoming available that allows home users to set up a backend system that can deliver received over the air ATSC signals to several frontend systems  for example  a HDHomeRun  VBox Home TV Gateway or similar TV tuner  used with MythTV or TVHeadEnd   a similar system for receiving FTA signals is considerably more difficult to set up   While PCI PCIe tuner cards and USB tuners for DVB S and DVB S  are available  there are often issues with drivers  or the cards may simply not be compatible with the backend software in use   Therefore  setting up such a system for FTA satellite reception tends to require considerably more technical knowledge  and a willingness to work through issues  than setting up such a system for receiving terrestrial signals  Some syndicated programming is being sent as data  similar to the way a video file might be sent over the Internet   This means that the programming is not sent in a format that can be viewed in real time  as it is being received   Instead  the data must be captured to a storage device and decoded for later use   Traditional satellite receivers and even many PC tuner cards are not capable of receiving these signals  and even if you have a card capable of receiving such signals  you also need special software to find such data streams and when one is found  to extract the data stream and save it  The largest groups of end users for Ku band free to air signals were initially the ethnic language communities  as often free ethnic language programming would be sponsored by Multilingual American Communities and their broadcasters  Depending on language and origin of the individual signals  North American ethnic language TV is a mix of pay TV  free to air and DBS operations  Today  many American broadcasters send a multitude of programming channels in many languages  spanning many new channels  so they can get National support  which ultimately leads to carriage by cable systems  to additionally support the high costs of broadcasting signals in this way  Nevertheless  free to air satellite TV is a viable addition to home video systems  not only for the reception of specialized content but also for use in locations where terrestrial ATSC over the air reception is incomplete and additional channels are desired   Oceania edit  Australia edit  See also  Television in Australia
