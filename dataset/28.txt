Lebanon took place after Israel invaded Lebanon during the      Lebanon War and subsequently retained its forces to support the Christian South Lebanon Army in Southern Lebanon  In       the Israeli Defense Forces  IDF  and allied Free Lebanon Army Christian militias seized large sections of Lebanon  including the capital of Beirut  amid the hostilities of the wider Lebanese Civil War  Later  Israel withdrew from parts of the occupied area between      and       but remained in partial control of the border region known as the South Lebanon Security Belt  initially in coordination with the self proclaimed Free Lebanon State  which executed a limited authority over portions of southern Lebanon until       and later with the South Lebanon Army  transformed from Free Lebanon Army   until the year       Israel s stated purpose for the Security Belt was to create a space separating its northern border towns from terrorists residing in Lebanon  citation needed  During the stay in the security belt  the IDF held many positions and supported the SLA  The SLA took over daily life in the security zone  initially as the official force of the Free Lebanon State and later as an allied militia  Notably  the South Lebanon Army controlled the prison in Khiam  In addition  United Nations  UN  forces and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  UNIFIL  were deployed to the security belt  from the end of Operation Litani in        The strip was a few kilometres wide  and consisted of about     of the total territory of Lebanon  which housed about         people who lived in    villages and towns made up of Shiites  Maronites and Druze  most of whom lived in the town of Hasbaya   In the central zone of the Strip was the Maronite town Marjayoun  which was the capital of the security belt  Residents remaining in the security zone had many contacts with Israel  many of whom have worked there and received various services from Israel   Contents    Background   History

featuring the Blue Line  UNIFIL zone  and Litani River        Main article  Free Lebanon State Although the strip was officially formed in       following degradation of the Free Lebanon State and the IDF withdrawal from most of South Lebanon  it has its roots in the early Lebanese civil war  From       the Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO  controlled southern Lebanon  In       the PLO s control became a severe nuisance to Christians and local residents  The Christians asked Israel for its assistance  From mid       Israel began to assist the Christian residents across the border by opening the border  or Good Fence  in Metola  and through military cooperation with the Christian militia  the Free Lebanon Army and later Free Lebanon State  which was established under the Christian officer Major Saad Haddad   History           Main article  South Lebanon conflict             During the evacuation in the first Lebanon war  the command of the SLA was delivered into the hands of Antoine Lahad  who demanded and received Israeli permission to hold the Jezzine zone north of the strip  In the first years after the IDF withdrawal from the north part of Lebanon  the strip was relatively quiet  Over the years  the Lebanese militant groups  led by Sh ite Hezbollah  increased on the Israeli side in the security belt  Driving on the roads became dangerous  and IDF forces stayed more in the military camps than on the roads  Hezbollah made many efforts to attack the IDF s military camps  On    February       the then leader of Hezbollah  Abbas Musawi  was assassinated by IDF s helicopter missiles  The IDF assumed that the Hezbollah leadership would curb their activities for fear of their lives and the lives of their families  Hezbollah was headed by Sheikh Nasrallah  At the time  Israeli soldiers serving in Southern Lebanon received no ribbon for wartime military service  because Israel considered the maintaining of the security belt as a low intensity conflict rather than a war     In early       Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said that      was  the IDF s most successful year in Lebanon  with    soldiers killed by hostiles in Southern Lebanon  the lowest casualty rate during the entire conflict     A total number of     Israeli soldiers died in combat in South Lebanon from      to          In       Israel recognized the conflict as a war  and retrospectively dubbed it the  Security Zone in Lebanon Campaign       Withdrawal from the security belt             Before the Israeli election in May      the prime minister of Israel  Ehud Barak  promised that within a year all Israeli forces would withdraw from Southern Lebanon  effectively dropping the support for the South Lebanon Army  When negotiation efforts between Israel and Syria  the goal of which was to bring a peace agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well  failed due to Syrian control of Lebanon  until        Barak led to the decision of withdrawal of the IDF to the Israeli border  With the mounting pressure on South Lebanon Army and the South Lebanon security belt administration  the system began to fall apart  with many members of the army and administration requesting political asylum in Israel and other countries  With mounting attacks of Hezbollah  the ranks of the South Lebanese Army deteriorated  with reduced conscription and high rates of desertion at lower ranks  In April       when it was clear the Israeli withdrawal was about to happen within weeks or months  some SLA officials began moving their families to northern Israel  The Israeli complete withdrawal took place on    May       No Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded during the redeployment to the internationally recognized border  citation needed  The South Lebanon Army however shortly collapsed  with most officers and administration officials fleeing to Israel with their families  as Hezbollah amounted pressure on the remaining units  When Israel allowed the pouring refugees in  some       refugees  including South Lebanon Army soldiers  Security Zone officials and their families arrived in Galilee   Provisional Administration Main article  South Lebanon security belt administration The South Lebanon security belt administration was a local provisional governance body in South Lebanon  in the South Lebanon security belt areas  It replaced the Free Lebanon State institutions and operated from      until      with full Israeli logistic and military support  It controlled     square kilometres      sq mi  of territory in southern Lebanon     During its functioning years  the administration was headed by Antoine Lahad  a Maronite Christian claiming the rank of general      Military forces Main article  South Lebanon Army The South Lebanon Army or South Lebanese Army  SLA   was a Lebanese Christian militia during the Lebanese Civil War and its aftermath  until disbanded in the year       It was originally named the Free Lebanon Army  which split from the Army of Free Lebanon  After       the militia operated in southern Lebanon under the authority of Saad Haddad s Government of Free Lebanon  It was supported by Israel  and became its primary ally in Lebanon during the South Lebanon conflict             to fight against Hezbollah   Demographics The strip was a few kilometres wide  and consisted of about     of the total territory of Lebanon  which housed about         people who lived in    villages and towns made up of Shiites  Maronites and Druze  most of whom lived in the town of Hasbaya   In the central zone of the Strip was the Maronite town Marjayoun  which was the capital of the security belt  Residents remaining in the security zone had many contacts with Israel  many of whom have worked there and received various services from Israel   Economy Main article  Good Fence The beginning of the Good Fence coincides with the beginning of the civil war in Lebanon in      and Israel  support of the predominantly Maronite militias in southern Lebanon in their battle with the PLO  From       Israel allowed the Maronites and their allies to find employment in Israel and provided assistance in exporting goods through the Israeli port city of Haifa  The main border crossing through which goods and workers crossed was the Fatima Gate crossing near Metula  This provided essential economic stability to the administration of Free Lebanon State and the South Lebanon security belt administration  Israel states that  before       approximately one third of the patients in the ophthalmology department of the Western Galilee Hospital were Lebanese citizens who crossed the border through the Good Fence and received treatment free of charge      The Good Fence ceased to exist with Israel s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in      and disintegration of the South Lebanon security belt administration   See also      South Lebanon conflict References     a b c Lancaster  Barton Gellman  John     April
