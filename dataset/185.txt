inhabitants of Abuja are the Gbagyi  Gwari   with the Gbagyi language formerly the major of the region language  and others in the area being Bassa  Gwandara  Gade  Dibo  Nupe and Koro  citation needed In light of the ethnic and religious divisions of Nigeria  plans had been devised since Nigeria s independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties  and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria  The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early     s as it signified neutrality and national unity  citation needed  Another impetus for Abuja came because of Lagos  population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid      As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development  the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country  and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja      The logic used was similar to the way Brazil planned its capital  Bras lia  The Federal Military Government of Nigeria  promulgated decree No    on the  th of February        which initiated the removal of the Federal Capital from Lagos to Abuja          The initial work for Abuja s planning and implementation were carried out by the Military Government of General s Murtala Mohammed and Olusegun Obasanjo and carried over into the Administration of Shehu Shagari       Construction started in the late     s but  due to economic and political instability  the initial stages of the city were not complete until the late     s  The move of Nigeria s Capital to Abuja was controversial  and the biggest opposition to it was led by Obafemi Awolowo      Awolowo  as a politician and a representative of the Yoruba people  defended their claims against the move of the Capital from Lagos  During the hotly contested campaign for presidency  he vowed to hire the American Walt Disney Corporation to convert the new site  Abuja  into an amusement park if he was elected      However  after his election as president  Alhaji Shehu Shagari showed a lot of support for the project and pushed for its early completion  His first journey outside of Lagos after his election was to Abuja  where he visited contractors and workers on site to urge a speedy completion of the project  On his return  he confided in Alhaji Abubakar Koko his disappointment with the slow progress of work      Shehu Shagari rescheduled the planned relocation to Abuja from      to      which later proved difficult      The International Planning Associates  IPA  was commissioned in June        by the Federal Capital Development Authority  FCDA  to produce the Abuja Master Plan and its regional grid      According to the terms of reference  the master planning process was to include a review of relevant data  selection of a capital city site  preparation of regional and city plans and the accompanying design and development standards manual      IPA did not exist prior to the Nigerian Government s engagement for an internationally reputable firm to design the master plan  IPA was formed by a consortium of three American firms which won the worldwide competitive bidding  The firms were Planning Research Corporation  PRC   Wallace  McHarg  Roberts and Todd  and Archisystems  a division of the Hughes Organisation   After winning the bid  and completing the project  the firms were disbanded  The final report was submitted to the pioneer Executive Secretary of FCDA  Alhaji Abubakar Koko  on February           In the preface to the master plan  the following declaration was made by IPA     The master plan for Abuja the new Capital City of Nigeria represents the culmination of    months  work by the Federal Capital Development Authority  FCDA  board  several advisory panels consultants  Without the unstinting efforts of these experts  the momentum now exhibited in the beginning of actual implementation of the new capital could not have been achieved  The plan itself represents a milestone in the process of building the new capital city  It is a necessary element in the monumental effort about to be undertaken by the Nigerian people   The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are now visible  More detailed design of the central areas of the capital  particularly its monumental core  was accomplished by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange  with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company  citation needed Most countries relocated their embassies to Abuja  and many

annually  This includes a warm  humid rainy season and a blistering dry season  In between the two  there is a brief interlude of harmattan occasioned by the northeast trade wind  with the main feature of dust haze and dryness  citation needed  The rainy season begins from April and ends in October  when daytime temperatures reach     C        F  to     C        F   and nighttime lows hover around     C        F  to     C        F   citation needed  In the dry season  daytime temperatures can soar as high as     C         F  and nighttime temperatures can dip to     C        F   Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above     C        F   The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory  The city s inland location causes the diurnal temperature variation to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as Lagos  citation needed  Rainfall in the FCT reflects the territory s location on the windward side of the Jos Plateau and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from April to October every year
