city is the municipality holding primary status in a department  country  state  province  or other administrative region  usually as its seat of government  A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government s offices and meeting places  the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution  In some jurisdictions  including several countries  the different branches of government are located in different settlements  In some cases  a distinction is made between the official  constitutional  capital and the seat of government  which is in another place  News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there  as a form of metonymy  For

References   Terminology edit  The word capital derives from the Latin caput  genitive capitis   meaning  head   In several English speaking states  the terms county town and county seat are also used in lower subdivisions  In some unitary states  subnational capitals may be known as  administrative centres   The capital is often the largest city of its constituent  though not always   Origins edit   The Roman Forum was surrounded by many government buildings as the capital of ancient Rome Historically  the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power  and became a capital through conquest or federation      The modern capital city has  however  not always existed  in medieval Western Europe  an itinerant  wandering  government was common      Examples are ancient Babylon  Abbasid Baghdad  ancient Athens  Rome  Constantinople  Chang an  ancient Cusco  Madrid  Paris  London  Moscow  Beijing  Tokyo  Vienna  Lisbon  and Berlin  The capital city naturally attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments  such as lawyers  political scientists  bankers  journalists  and public policy makers  Some of these cities are or were also religious centres     e g  Constantinople  more than one religion   Rome  the Roman Catholic Church   Jerusalem  more than one religion   Babylon  Moscow  the Russian Orthodox Church   Belgrade  the Serbian Orthodox Church   Paris  and Beijing  The convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal  Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals  e g  Nanking by Shanghai  Quebec City by Montreal  and numerous US state capitals  The decline of a dynasty or culture could also mean the extinction of its capital city  as occurred at Babylon    and Cahokia  Although many capitals are defined by constitution or legislation  many long time capitals have no legal designation as such  including Bern  Edinburgh  Lisbon  London  Paris  and Wellington  They are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention  and because all or almost all the country s central political institutions  such as government departments  supreme court  legislature  embassies  etc   are located in or near them   Modern capitals edit     Countries whose capital is on the coast   Countries whose capital is not on the coast   Countries without a coast    Countries that currently have multiple capital cities   Countries that have previously had multiple capital cities  but now only have one capital city  Tehran  capital and largest city of Iran  and the capital of the Persian empires in the last two centuries  Nuuk  the capital of Greenland Counties in the United Kingdom have historic county towns  which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centers  as many historical counties are now only ceremonial  and administrative boundaries are different  In Canada  there is a federal capital  while the ten provinces and three territories each have capital cities  The states of such countries as Mexico  Brazil  including the famous cities of Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo  capitals of their respective states   and Australia also each have capital cities  For example  the six state capitals of Australia are Adelaide  Brisbane  Hobart  Melbourne  Perth  and Sydney  In Australia  the term  capital cities  is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital Canberra  and Darwin  the capital of the Northern Territory  Abu Dhabi is the capital city of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and also of the United Arab Emirates overall  In unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations  such as the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Denmark  each will usually have its own capital city  Unlike in federations  there is usually not a separate national capital  but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall  such as London  which is the capital of England and of the United Kingdom  Similarly  each of the autonomous communities of Spain and regions of Italy has a capital city  such as Seville and Naples  while Madrid is the capital of the Community of Madrid and of the Kingdom of Spain as a whole and Rome is the capital of Italy and of the region of Lazio  In the Federal Republic of Germany  each of its constituent states  or L nder  plural of Land  has its own capital city  such as Dresden  Wiesbaden  Mainz  D sseldorf  Stuttgart  and Munich  as do all of the republics of the Russian Federation  The national capitals of Germany and Russia  the Stadtstaat of Berlin and the federal city of Moscow  are also constituent states of both countries in their own right  Each of the states of Austria and cantons of Switzerland also have their own capital cities  Vienna  the national capital of Austria  is also one of the states  while Bern is the  de facto  capital of both Switzerland and of the Canton of Bern  Many national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries  but in many countries this is not the case   Planned capitals edit   The L Enfant Plan for Washington  D C   the capital of the United States Governing entities sometimes plan  design and build new capital cities to house the seat of government of a polity or of a subdivision  Deliberately planned and designed capitals include   Abuja  Nigeria        Amaravati  Andhra Pradesh  India

Philippines           Raleigh  North Carolina  USA        Valletta  Malta        Washington  D C   USA        These cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria   A deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government  superseding a capital city that was in an established population center  There have been various reasons for this  including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area  and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate  usually a less tropical one   A town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities  or other political divisions   none of which was willing to concede to the other s  the privilege of being the capital city  Usually  the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres  Compromise locations edit   The Australian Parliament opened in the small town of Canberra in      as a compromise between the largest cities  Sydney and Melbourne  Some examples of the second situation  compromise locations  are   Canberra  Australia  chosen as a compromise located between Melbourne and Sydney  Washington  D C   United

Disputed capitals edit  Israel and Palestine  Both Government of Israel     and the Palestinian Authority     claim Jerusalem as capital  Jerusalem serves as Israel s capital  with the presidential residence  government offices  supreme court and parliament  Knesset  located there  while the Palestinian Authority has no de facto or de jure control over any of Jerusalem  Many countries  with the notable exception of the United States  which recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel      take the position that the final status of Jerusalem is unsettled pending future negotiations  Most countries maintain their diplomatic missions to Israel in Tel Aviv  while diplomatic missions to Palestine are in various places such as Ramallah  Gaza City  Cairo and Damascus  Capital as symbol edit   Mariehamn  capital city of  the  land Islands  a demilitarized archipelago with self governance With the rise of the modern nation state  the capital city has become a symbol for the state and its government  and imbued with political meaning  Unlike medieval capitals  which were declared wherever a monarch held his or her court  the selection  relocation  founding  or capture of a modern capital city is a highly symbolic event  For example   The ruined and almost uninhabited Athens was made capital of newly independent Greece in       four years after the country gained its independence  with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of Ancient Greece      Similarly  following the Cold War and German reunification  Berlin is now once again the capital of Germany      Other restored capital cities include Moscow after the October Revolution  A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either economic or strategic reasons  sometimes known as a forward capital or spearhead capital   Peter the Great moved his government from Moscow to Saint Petersburg to give the Russian Empire a European orientation      The economically significant city of Nafplion became the first capital of Greece  when Athens was an unimportant village      The Ming emperors moved their capital to Beijing from the more central Nanjing to help supervise the border with the Mongols  During the      rebellion  Indian rebels considered Delhi their capital  and Bahadur Shah Zafar was proclaimed emperor  but the ruling British had their capital in Calcutta  In       the British formally held a  Durbar  in Delhi  proclaiming Queen Victoria as  Empress of India   Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the Coronation Durbar of King Emperor George V in       continuing as independent India s capital from       Other examples include Abuja  Astana  Bras lia  Helsinki  Islamabad  Naypyidaw and Yamoussoukro  The selection or founding of a  neutral  capital city  one unencumbered by regional or political identities  was meant to represent the unity of a new state when Ankara  Bern  Canberra  Madrid  Ottawa and Washington became capital cities  Sometimes  the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities  such as in the cases of Canberra  Ottawa  Washington  Wellington and Managua  The British built town of New Delhi represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past  the location of Delhi being where many imperial capitals were built  Indraprastha  Dhillika  and Shahjahanabad  but the actual capital being the new British built town designed by Edwin Lutyens  Wellington  on the southwestern tip of the North Island of New Zealand  replaced the much more northerly city of Auckland to place the national capital close to the South Island and hence to placate its residents  many of whom had sympathies with separatism  During the American Civil War  tremendous resources were expended to defend Washington  D C   which bordered on the Confederate States of America  with the Commonwealth of Virginia   from Confederate attack even though the relatively small federal government could easily have been moved elsewhere  Likewise  great resources were expended by the Confederacy in defending the Confederate capital from attack by the Union  in its exposed location of Richmond  Virginia  barely     miles      km  south of Washington  D C      Capitals in military strategy edit   As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China  Beijing has served as the political center of China for most of the past eight centuries   Constantinople  the capital of the Byzantine Empire  was the final part of the empire to fall to the Ottoman Turks due to its strong defences  The capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war  as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government  victory for the attacking forces  or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces  In ancient China  where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level  a dynasty could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital  In the Three Kingdoms period  both Shu and Wu fell when their respective capitals of Chengdu and Jianye fell  The Ming dynasty relocated its capital from Nanjing to Beijing  where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from Mongols and Manchus  The Ming was destroyed when Li Zicheng took their seat of power  and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history  until the fall of the traditional Confucian monarchy in the   th century  After the Qing dynasty s collapse  decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of Japanese invasion  National capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world  including the West  because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority  a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of feudalism and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies  In       after the Latin Crusaders captured the Byzantine capital  Constantinople  Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces  provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after    years and preserve the empire for another     years after that  The British forces sacked various American capitals repeatedly during the Revolutionary War and War of       but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside  where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent civilian frontiersmen  Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as France  whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far flung resources  giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals  but risking utter ruin if the capital were taken    See also edit     Wikimedia Commons has media related to Capitals   Capital region Lists of capitals List of
