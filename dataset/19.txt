or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city  Suburbs might have their own political jurisdiction  especially in the United States  but this is not always the case  especially in the United Kingdom where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities      In most English speaking countries  suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas  but in Australian English and South African English  suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a  neighborhood  in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas  In some areas  such as Australia  India  China  New Zealand  the United Kingdom  and parts of the United States and Canada  new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities  In others  such as Morocco  France  and much of the United States and Canada  many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county  In the United States  beyond the suburbs are exurbs  or  exurban areas   with less density but linked to the metropolitan area economically and by commuters  Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the   th and   th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport  which led to an increase in commuting     In general  they have lower population densities than inner city neighborhoods within a metropolitan area  and most residents commute to central cities or other business districts  however  there are many exceptions  including industrial suburbs  planned communities  and satellite cities  Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land      Contents    Etymology and usage      Australia and New Zealand     Britain and Ireland     North

when to remove this template message  The English word is derived from the Old French subburbe  which is in turn derived from the Latin suburbium  formed from sub  meaning  under  or  below   and urbs   city    The first recorded usage of the term in English  was by John Wycliffe in       when the form subarbis was used  according to the Oxford English Dictionary   Australia and New Zealand edit  In Australia and also New Zealand  suburban areas  in the wider sense noted in the lead paragraph  have become formalised as geographic subdivisions of a city and are used by postal services in addressing  In rural areas in both countries  their equivalents are called localities  see suburbs and localities   The terms inner suburb and outer suburb are used to differentiate between the higher density areas in proximity to the city centre  which would not be referred to as  suburbs  in most other countries   and the lower density suburbs on the outskirts of the urban area  The term  middle suburbs  is also used  Inner suburbs  such as Te Aro in Wellington  Eden Terrace in Auckland  Prahran in Melbourne and Ultimo in Sydney  are usually characterised by higher density apartment housing and greater integration between commercial and residential areas  In New Zealand  most suburbs are not legally defined  which can lead to confusion as to where they may begin and end     Although there is a geospatial file defining suburbs for use by emergency services developed and maintained by Fire and Emergency New Zealand  formerly the New Zealand Fire Service   in collaboration with other government agencies  to date this file has not been released publicly  New Zealand company Koordinates Limited requested access to the geospatial file under the Official Information Act      but this request was rejected by the New Zealand Fire Service on the basis that it would prejudice the health   safety of  or cause material loss  to the public  In September       the Ombudsman of New Zealand ruled that the New Zealand Fire Service acted reasonably in refusing to release the geospatial file without agreeing to terms which included  among other restrictions  a prohibition on redistribution of the geospatial file      Britain and Ireland edit  In the United Kingdom and in Ireland  suburb merely refers to a residential area outside the city centre  regardless of administrative boundaries     Suburbs  in this sense  can range from areas that seem more like residential areas of a city proper to areas separated by open countryside from the city centre  In large cities such as London and Leeds  many suburbs are formerly separate towns and villages that have been absorbed during a city s expansion  such as Ealing  Bromley  and Guiseley   North America edit  In the United States and Canada  suburb can refer either to an outlying residential area of a city or town or to a separate municipality or unincorporated area outside a town or city   History edit  Early history edit  The earliest appearance of suburbs coincided with the spread of the first urban settlements  Large walled towns tended to be the focus around which smaller villages grew up in a symbiotic relationship with the market town  The word suburbani was first employed by the Roman statesman Cicero in reference to the large villas and estates built by the wealthy patricians of Rome on the city s outskirts  Towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty  until     AD  when Dong Zhuo razed the city  the capital  Luoyang  was mainly occupied by the emperor and important officials  the city s people mostly lived in small cities right outside Luoyang  which were suburbs in all but name     As populations grew during the Early Modern Period in Europe  towns swelled with a steady influx of people from the countryside  In some places  nearby settlements were swallowed up as the main city expanded  The peripheral areas on the outskirts of the city were generally inhabited by the very poorest      Origins of the modern suburb edit  Due to the rapid migration of the rural poor to the industrialising cities of England in the late   th century  a trend in the opposite direction began to develop  that is  newly rich members of the middle classes began to purchase estates and villas on the outskirts of London  This trend accelerated through the   th century  especially in cities like London and Birmingham that were growing rapidly  and the first suburban districts sprung up around the city centres to accommodate those who wanted to escape the squalid conditions of the industrial towns  Toward the end of the century  with the development of public transit systems such as the underground railways  trams and buses  it became possible for the majority of the city s population to reside outside the city and to commute into the center for work       The cover of the Metro Land guide published in      By the mid   th century  the first major suburban areas were springing up around London as the city  then the largest in the world  became more overcrowded and unsanitary  A major catalyst for suburban growth was the opening of the Metropolitan Railway in the     s  The line later joined the capital s financial heart in the City to what were to become the suburbs of Middlesex     The line reached Harrow in       Unlike other railway companies  which were required to dispose of surplus land  the Met was allowed to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use  note    Initially  the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee      and  from the     s  the land was developed and sold to domestic buyers in places like Willesden Park Estate  Cecil Park  near Pinner and at Wembley Park  In       it was suggested that a specially formed company should take over from the Surplus Lands Committee and develop suburban estates near the railway      However  World War I delayed these plans and it was only in       with the expectation of a postwar housing boom      that Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited  MRCE  was formed  MRCE went on to develop estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden  Wembley Park  Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth and create places such as Harrow Garden Village           The term  Metro land  was coined by the Met s marketing department in      when the Guide to the Extension Line became the Metro land guide  priced at  d  This promoted the land served by the Met for the walker  visitor and later the house hunter      Published annually until       the last full year of independence for the Met  the guide extolled the benefits of  The good air of the Chilterns   using language such as  Each lover of Metroland may well have his own favourite wood beech and coppice   all tremulous green loveliness in Spring and russet and gold in October       The dream promoted was of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London      By       people from across London had flocked to live the new suburban dream in large newly built areas across north west London      Interwar suburban expansion in England edit  Suburbanisation in the interwar period was heavily influenced by the garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard and the creation of the first garden suburbs at the turn of the   th century      The first garden suburb was developed through the efforts of social reformer Henrietta Barnett and her husband  inspired by Ebenezer Howard and the model housing development movement  then exemplified by Letchworth garden city   as well as the desire to protect part of Hampstead Heath from development  they established trusts in      which bought     acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green and created the Hampstead Garden Suburb  The suburb attracted the talents of architects including Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens  and it ultimately grew to encompass over     acres        Mock Tudor semi detached cottages  built c       During the First World War the Tudor Walters Committee was commissioned to make recommendations for the post war reconstruction and housebuilding  In part  this was a response to the shocking lack of fitness amongst many recruits during World War One  attributed to poor living conditions  a belief summed up in a housing poster of the period  you cannot expect to get an A  population out of C  homes    referring to military fitness classifications of the period  The Committee s report of      was taken up by the government  which passed the Housing  Town Planning   c  Act       also known as the Addison Act after Dr  Christopher Addison  the then Minister for Housing  The Act allowed for the building of large new housing estates in the suburbs after the First World War      and marked the start of a long   th century tradition of state owned housing  which would later evolve into council estates  The Report also legislated on the required  minimum standards necessary for further suburban construction  this included regulation on the maximum housing density and their arrangement and it even made recommendations on the ideal number of bedrooms and other rooms per house  Although the semi detached house was first designed by the Shaws  a father and son architectural partnership  in the   th century  it was during the suburban housing boom of the interwar period that the design first proliferated as a suburban icon  being preferred by middle class home owners to the smaller terraced houses      The design of many of these houses  highly characteristic of the era  was heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement  taking influence from Tudor Revival  chalet style  and even ship design  Within just a decade suburbs dramatically increased in size  Harrow Weald went from just       to over        while Pinner jumped from       to over         During the     s  over   million new suburban houses were built  the  suburban revolution  had made England the most heavily suburbanized country in the world  by a considerable margin       North America edit   View of housing development in Richfield  Minnesota in       Suburban Santa Fe  New Mexico  Suburban Dallas  Texas seen in the foreground  Big box shopping centers in suburban New Orleans  Louisiana Boston and New York spawned the first major suburbs  The streetcar lines in Boston and the rail lines in Manhattan made daily commutes possible       No metropolitan area in the world was as well served by railroad commuter lines at the turn of the twentieth century as New York  and it was the rail lines to Westchester from the Grand Central Terminal commuter hub that enabled its development  Westchester s true importance in the history of American suburbanization derives from the upper middle class development of villages including Scarsdale  New Rochelle and Rye serving thousands of businessmen and executives from Manhattan       Post war suburban expansion edit  The suburban population in North America exploded during the post World War II economic expansion  Returning veterans wishing to start a settled life moved in masses to the suburbs  Levittown developed as a major prototype of mass produced housing  Due to the influx of people in these suburban areas  the amount of shopping centers began to increase as suburban America took shape  These malls helped supply goods and services to the growing urban population  Shopping for different goods and services in one central location without having to travel to multiple locations  helped to keep shopping centers a component of these newly designed suburbs which were booming in population  The television helped contribute to the rise of shopping centers due to the increased advertisement on television in addition to a desire to have products shown in suburban life in various television programs  Another factor that led to the rise of these shopping centers was the building of many highways  The Highway Act of      helped to fund the building of        kilometers across the nation by having     thousand million to use  which helped to link many more to these shopping centers with ease      These newly built shopping centers  which were often large buildings full of multiple stores  and services  were being used for more than shopping  but as a place of leisure and a meeting point for those who lived within suburban America at this time  These centers thrived offering goods and services to the growing populations in suburban America  In           Shopping centers were built and this number more than doubled by      to keep up with the demand of these densely populated areas       Housing edit  Very little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War II  except for emergency quarters near war industries  Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition  Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown  However  the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles  highways  and inexpensive housing  The population had grown  and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments  automobiles and appliances  The product was a great housing boom  Whereas  an average of         new housing non farm units should have been constructed     s through       there were           annually from      through           The G I  Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans  with very low down payments  and low interest rates  With    million eligible veterans  the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand  In      alone          veterans bought one  their average price was        The construction industry kept prices low by standardization   for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets  refrigerators and stoves  allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings  Developers purchased empty land just outside the city  installed tract houses based on a handful of designs  and provided streets and utilities  or local public officials race to build schools      The most famous development was Levittown  in Long Island just east of New York City  It offered a new house for       down  and     a month  it featured three bedrooms  fireplace  gas range and gas furnace  and a landscaped lot of    by     feet  all for a total price of          Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment      At the same time  African Americans were rapidly moving north and west for better jobs and educational opportunities than were available to them in the segregated South  Their arrival in Northern and Western cities en masse  in addition to being followed by race riots in several large cities such as Philadelphia  Los Angeles  Detroit  Chicago  and Washington  D C   further stimulated white suburban migration  The growth of the suburbs was facilitated by the development of zoning laws  redlining and numerous innovations in transport  After World War II  availability of FHA loans stimulated a housing boom in American suburbs  In the older cities of the northeast U S   streetcar suburbs originally developed along train or trolley lines that could shuttle workers into and out of city centers where the jobs were located  This practice gave rise to the term  bedroom community   meaning that most daytime business activity took place in the city  with the working population leaving the city at night for the purpose of going home to sleep  Economic growth in the United States encouraged the suburbanization of American cities that required massive investments for the new infrastructure and homes  Consumer patterns were also shifting at this time  as purchasing power was becoming stronger and more accessible to a wider range of families  Suburban houses also brought about needs for products that were not needed in urban neighborhoods  such as lawnmowers and automobiles  During this time commercial shopping malls were being developed near suburbs to satisfy consumers  needs and their car dependent lifestyle      Zoning laws also contributed to the location of residential areas outside of the city center by creating wide areas or  zones  where only residential buildings were permitted  These suburban residences are built on larger lots of land than in the central city  For example  the lot size for a residence in Chicago is usually     feet     m  deep      while the width can vary from    feet      m  wide for a row house to    feet     m  wide for a large stand alone house  citation needed  In the suburbs  where stand alone houses are the rule  lots may be    feet     m  wide by     feet     m  deep  as in the Chicago suburb of Naperville  citation needed  Manufacturing and commercial buildings were segregated in other areas of the city  Alongside suburbanization  many companies began locating their offices and other facilities in the outer areas of the cities  which resulted in the increased density of older suburbs and the growth of lower density suburbs even further from city centers  An alternative strategy is the deliberate design of  new towns  and the protection of green belts around cities  Some social reformers attempted to combine the best of both concepts in the garden city movement      In the U S        was the first year that more people lived in suburbs than elsewhere      In the U S  the development of the skyscraper and the sharp inflation of downtown real estate prices also led to downtowns being more fully dedicated to businesses  thus pushing residents outside the city center   Worldwide edit  United States edit  In the   th century  many suburban areas  especially those not within the political boundaries of the city containing the central business area  began to see independence from the central city as an asset  In some cases  suburbanites saw self government as a means to keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living  Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions      In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco  the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas  leaving the city proper with a small portion of the metro area s population and land area  Mesa  Arizona and Virginia Beach  the two most populous suburbs in the United States  are actually more populous than many of America s largest cities  including Miami  Minneapolis  New Orleans  Cleveland  Tampa  St  Louis  Pittsburgh  Cincinnati  and others  Virginia Beach is now the largest city in all of Virginia  having long since exceeded the population of its neighboring primary city  Norfolk  While Virginia Beach has slowly been taking on the characteristics of an urban city  it will not likely achieve the population density and urban characteristics of Norfolk   It is generally assumed that the population of Chesapeake  another Hampton Roads city  will also exceed that of Norfolk in      if its current growth rate continues at its same pace  Cleveland  Ohio is typical of many American central cities  its municipal borders have changed little since       even though the Cleveland urbanized area has grown many times over  citation needed  Several layers of suburban municipalities now surround cities like Boston  Cleveland  Chicago  Detroit  Los Angeles  Dallas  Denver  Houston  New York City  San Francisco  Sacramento  Atlanta  Miami  Baltimore  Milwaukee  Pittsburgh  Philadelphia  Phoenix  Roanoke  St  Louis  Salt Lake City  Las Vegas  Minneapolis  and Washington  D C   Suburbs in the United States have a prevalence of usually detached     single family homes      They are characterized by   Lower densities than central cities  dominated by single family homes on small plots of land   anywhere from     acres     and up   surrounded at close quarters by very similar dwellings  Zoning patterns that separate residential and commercial development  as well as different intensities and densities of development   Daily needs are not within walking distance of most homes  A greater percentage of whites  both non Hispanic and  in some areas  Hispanic  and lesser percentage of citizens of other ethnic groups than in urban areas  However  black suburbanization grew between      and      by      as a result of central city neighborhoods expanding into older neighborhoods vacated by whites              Subdivisions carved from previously rural land into multiple home developments built by a single real estate company   These subdivisions are often segregated by minute differences in home value  creating entire communities where family incomes and demographics are almost completely homogeneous  citation needed   Shopping malls and strip malls behind large parking lots instead of a classic downtown shopping district  A road network designed to conform to a hierarchy  including cul de sac  leading to larger residential streets  in turn leading to large collector roads  in place of the grid pattern common to most central cities and pre World War II suburbs  A greater percentage of one story administrative buildings than in urban areas  Compared to rural areas  suburbs usually have greater population density  higher standards of living  more complex road systems  more franchised stores and restaurants  and less farmland and wildlife  By       suburbs increasingly gained people in racial minority groups  as many members of minority groups gained better access to education and sought more favorable living conditions compared to inner city areas  Conversely  many white Americans also moved back to city centers  Nearly all major city downtowns  such as Downtown Miami  Downtown Detroit  Downtown Philadelphia  Downtown Roanoke  or Downtown Los Angeles  are experiencing a renewal  with large population growth  residential apartment construction  and increased social  cultural  and infrastructural investments  as have suburban neighborhoods close to city centers  Better public transit  proximity to work and cultural attractions  and frustration with suburban life and gridlock have attracted young Americans to the city centers       Canadian suburbs edit   Canadian suburbs often feature high density nodes  as seen in Burnaby  British Columbia   Higher Density Development in Mississauga as seen from Toronto s Pearson Airport  A typical low density Canadian suburban scene in Langley  British Columbia  Canada is an urbanized nation where over     of the population live in urban areas  loosely defined   and roughly two thirds live in one of Canada s    census metropolitan areas  CMAs  with a population of over           However  of this metropolitan population  in      nearly half lived in low density neighborhoods  with only one in five living in a typical  urban  neighborhood  The percentage living in low density neighborhoods varied from a high of nearly two thirds of Calgary CMA residents        to a low of about one third of Montr al CMA residents        Often  Canadian suburbs are less automobile centred and public transit use is encouraged but can be notably unused      Throughout Canada  there are comprehensive plans in place to curb sprawl  Population and income growth in Canadian suburbs had tended to outpace growth in core urban or rural areas  but in many areas this trend has now reversed  The suburban population increased     between      and       well ahead of urban growth      The majority of recent population growth in Canada s three largest metropolitan areas  Greater Toronto  Greater Montr al  and Greater Vancouver  has occurred in non core municipalities  This trend is also beginning to take effect in Vancouver  and to a lesser extent  Montr al  In certain cities  particularly Edmonton and Calgary  suburban growth takes place within the city boundaries as opposed to in bedroom communities  This is due to annexation and large geographic footprint within the city borders  Calgary is unusual among Canadian cities because it has developed as a unicity   it has annexed most of its surrounding towns and large amounts of undeveloped land around the city  As a result  most of the communities that Calgarians refer to as  suburbs  are actually inside the city limits      In the      census  the City of Calgary had a population of            whereas the Calgary Metropolitan Area had a population of            indicating the vast majority of people in the Calgary CMA lived within the city limits  The perceived low population density of Calgary largely results from its many internal suburbs and the large amount of undeveloped land within the city  The city actually has a policy of densifying its new developments       Other countries edit   The Sydney city centre from the city s western suburbs   Kontula  a suburban neighborhood in the East Helsinki area of Helsinki  Finland  A neighbourhood in Amman  Jordan  In many parts of the developed world  suburbs can be economically distressed areas  inhabited by higher proportions of recent immigrants  with higher delinquency rates and social problems  Sometimes the notion of suburb may even refer to people in real misery  who are kept at the limit of the city borders for economic  social  and sometimes ethnic reasons  An example in the developed world would be the banlieues of France  or the concrete suburbs of Sweden  even if the suburbs of these countries also include middle class and upper class neighborhoods that often consist of single family houses  Thus some of the suburbs of most of the developed world are comparable to several inner cities of the U S  The growth in the use of trains  and later automobiles and highways  increased the ease with which workers could have a job in the city while commuting in from the suburbs  In the United Kingdom  as mentioned above  railways stimulated the first mass exodus to the suburbs  The Metropolitan Railway  for example  was active in building and promoting its own housing estates in the north west of London  consisting mostly of detached houses on large plots  which it then marketed as  Metro land       The Australian and New Zealand usage came about as outer areas were quickly surrounded in fast growing cities  but retained the appellation suburb  the term was eventually applied to the original core as well  In Australia  Sydney s urban sprawl has occurred predominantly in the Western Suburbs  The locality of Olympic Park was designated an official suburb in       In the UK  the government is seeking to impose minimum densities on newly approved housing schemes in parts of South East England  The goal is to  build sustainable communities  rather than housing estates  However  commercial concerns tend to delay the opening of services until a large number of residents have occupied the new neighbourhood  In Mexico  suburbs are generally similar to their United States counterparts  Houses are made in many different architectural styles which may be of European  American and International architecture and which vary in size  Suburbs can be found in Guadalajara  Mexico City  Monterrey  and most major cities  Lomas de Chapultepec is an example of an affluent suburb  although it is located inside the city and by no means is today a suburb in the strict sense of the word  In other countries  the situation is similar to that of Mexico  with many suburbs being built  most notably in Peru and Chile  which have experienced a boom in the construction of suburbs since the late     s and early   s  As the growth of middle class and upper class suburbs increased  low class squatter areas have increased  most notably  lost cities  in Mexico  campamentos in Chile  barriadas in Peru  villa miserias in Argentina  asentamientos in Guatemala and favelas of Brazil  Brazilian affluent suburbs are generally denser  more vertical and mixed in use inner suburbs  They concentrate infrastructure  investment and attention from the municipal seat and the best offer of mass transit  True sprawling towards neighboring municipalities is typically empoverished   periferia  the periphery  in the sense of it dealing with spatial marginalization     with a very noticeable example being the rail suburbs of Rio de Janeiro   the North Zone  the Baixada Fluminense  the part of the West Zone associated with SuperVia s Ramal de Santa Cruz  These  in comparison with the inner suburbs  often prove to be remote  violent food deserts with inadequate sewer structure coverage  saturated mass transit  more precarious running water  electricity and communication services  and lack of urban planning and landscaping  while also not necessarily qualifying as actual favelas or slums  They often are former agricultural land or wild areas settled through squatting  and grew in amount particularly due to mass rural exodus during the years of the military dictatorship  This is particularly true to S o Paulo  Rio de Janeiro and Bras lia  which grew with migration from more distant and empoverished parts of the country and dealt with overpopulation as a result    RAJUK Uttara Apartment complex at Uttara  a suburb of Dhaka  Bangladesh  In Africa  since the beginning of the     s  the development of middle class suburbs boomed  Due to the industrialization of many African countries  particularly in cities such as Cairo  Johannesburg and Lagos  the middle class has grown  In an illustrative case of South Africa  RDP housing has been built  In much of Soweto  many houses are American in appearance  but are smaller  and often consist of a kitchen and living room  two or three bedrooms  and a bathroom  However  there are more affluent neighborhoods  more comparable to American suburbs  particularly east of the FNB Stadium  In Cape Town there is a distinct European style which is due to the European influence during the mid     s when the Dutch settled the Cape  Houses like these are called Cape Dutch Houses and can be found in the affluent suburbs of Constantia and Bishopscourt  In the illustrative case of Rome  Italy  in the     s and     s  suburbs were intentionally created ex novo in order to give lower classes a destination  in consideration of the actual and foreseen massive arrival of poor people from other areas of the country  Many critics have seen in this development pattern  which was circularly distributed in every direction  also a quick solution to a problem of public order  keeping the unwelcome poorest classes together with the criminals  in this way better controlled  comfortably remote from the elegant  official  town   On the other hand  the expected huge expansion of the town soon effectively covered the distance from the central town  and now those suburbs are completely engulfed by the main territory of the town  Other newer suburbs  called exurbs  were created at a further distance from them  In Russia  the term suburb refers to high rise residential apartments which usually consist of two bedrooms  one bathroom  a kitchen and a living room  These suburbs  however are usually not in poor neighborhoods  unlike the banlieuees    Apartments in suburban Beijing  China In China  the term suburb is new  although suburbs are already being constructed rapidly  Chinese suburbs mostly consist of rows upon rows of apartment blocks and condos that end abruptly into the countryside          Also new town developments are extremely common  Single family suburban homes tend to be similar to their Western equivalents  although primarily outside Beijing and Shanghai  also mimic Spanish and Italian architecture      In Hong Kong  however  suburbs are mostly government planned new towns containing numerous public housing estates  New Towns such as Tin Shui Wai may gain notoriety as a slum  However  other new towns also contain private housing estates and low density developments for the upper classes  In Japan  the construction of suburbs has boomed since the end of World War II and many cities are experiencing the urban sprawl effect    Bangsar  a suburb outside of downtown Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  In Malaysia  suburbs are common  especially in areas surrounding the Klang Valley  which is the largest conurbation in the country  These suburbs also serve as major housing areas and commuter towns  Terraced houses  semi detached houses and shophouses are common concepts in suburbs  In certain areas such as Klang  Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya  suburbs form the core of these places  The latter one has been turned into a satellite city of Kuala Lumpur  Suburbs are also evident in other major conurbations in the country including Penang  e g  Pulau Tikus   Ipoh  e g

within the short streets themselves is less  This is due to three factors  citation needed  almost mandatory automobile ownership due to poor suburban bus systems  longer travel distances and the hierarchy system  which is less efficient at distributing traffic than the traditional grid of streets  In the suburban system  most trips from one component to another component requires that cars enter a collector road citation needed   no matter how short or long the distance is  This is compounded by the hierarchy of streets  where entire neighborhoods and subdivisions are dependent on one or two collector roads  Because all traffic is forced onto these roads  they are often heavy with traffic all day  If a traffic crash occurs on a collector road  or if road construction inhibits the flow  then the entire road system may be rendered useless until the blockage is cleared  The traditional  grown  grid  in turn  allows for a larger number of choices and alternate routes  Suburban systems of the sprawl type are also quite inefficient for cyclists or pedestrians  as the direct route is usually not available for them either citation needed   This encourages car trips even for distances as low as several hundreds of yards or meters  which may have become up to several miles or kilometers due to the road network   Improved sprawl systems  though retaining the car detours  possess cycle paths and footpaths connecting across the arms of the sprawl system  allowing a more direct route while still keeping the cars out of the residential and side streets  More commonly  central cities seek ways to tax nonresidents working downtown   known as commuter taxes   as property tax bases dwindle  Taken together  these two groups of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities may begin to target more aggressively  particularly if they re struggling  According to struggling cities  this will help bring in a substantial revenue for the city which is a great way to tax the people who make the most use of the highways and repairs  Today more companies settle down in suburbs because of low property costs   Academic study edit  The history of suburbia is part of the study of urban history  which focuses on the origins  growth  diverse typologies  culture  and politics of suburbs  as well as on the gendered and family oriented nature of suburban space          Many people have assumed that early   th century suburbs were enclaves for middle class whites  a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical  Some suburbs are based on a society of working class and minority residents  many of whom want to own their own house  Meanwhile  other suburbs have instituted  explicitly racist  policies to deter people deemed as  other   a practice most common in the United States in contrast to other countries around the world      Mary Corbin Sies argues that it is necessary to examine how  suburb  is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs  geography  economic circumstances  and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions       In popular culture edit  This article appears to contain trivial  minor  or unrelated references to popular culture  Please reorganize

variety of films  books  television shows and songs  French songs like La Zone by Fr hel         Aux quatre coins de la banlieue by Damia         Ma banlieue by Reda Caire         or Banlieue by Robert Lamoureux         evoke the suburbs of Paris explicitly since the     s      Those singers give a sunny festive  almost bucolic  image of the suburbs  yet still few urbanized  During the fifties and the sixties  French singer songwriter L o Ferr  evokes in his songs popular and proletarian suburbs of Paris  to oppose them to the city  considered by comparison as a bourgeois and conservative place  French cinema was although soon interested in urban changes in the suburbs  with such movies as Mon oncle by Jacques Tati         L Amour existe by Maurice Pialat        or Two or Three Things I Know About Her by Jean Luc Godard         In his one act opera Trouble in Tahiti         Leonard Bernstein skewers American suburbia  which produces misery instead of happiness  The American photojournalist Bill Owens documented the culture of suburbia in the     s  most notably in his book Suburbia  The      song  Little Boxes  by Malvina Reynolds lampoons the development of suburbia and its perceived bourgeois and conformist values      while the      song Subdivisions by the Canadian band Rush also discusses suburbia  as does Rockin  the Suburbs by Ben Folds  The      album The Suburbs by the Canadian based alternative band Arcade Fire dealt with aspects of growing up in suburbia  suggesting aimlessness  apathy and endless rushing are ingrained into the suburban culture and mentality  Suburb The Musical  was written by Robert S  Cohen and David Javerbaum  Over the Hedge is a syndicated comic strip written and drawn by Michael Fry and T  Lewis  It tells the story of a raccoon  turtle  a squirrel  and their friends who come to terms with their woodlands being taken over by suburbia  trying to survive the increasing flow of humanity and technology while becoming enticed by it at the same time  A film adaptation of Over the Hedge was produced in       British television series such as The Good Life  Butterflies and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin have depicted suburbia as well manicured but relentlessly boring  and its residents as either overly conforming or prone to going stir crazy  In contrast  U S  shows   such as Knots Landing  Desperate Housewives and Weeds   portray the suburbs as concealing darker secrets behind a fa ade of perfectly manicured lawns  friendly people  and beautifully kept houses  Films such as The  Burbs  Disturbia and Hot Fuzz  have brought this theme to the cinema  This trope was also used in the episode of The X Files  Arcadia  and on one level of the video game Psychonauts   See also edit     Bibliography of
