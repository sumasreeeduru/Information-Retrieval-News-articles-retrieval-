minute summaries taken from reports from the United Press  one of the three wire services that supplied newspapers with national and international news  In December      CBS chief William S  Paley hired journalist Paul W  White away from United Press as CBS s news editor  Paley put the radio network s news operation at the same level as entertainment  and authorized White to interrupt programming if events warranted  Along with other networks  CBS chafed at the breaking news embargo imposed upon radio by the wire services  which prevented them from using bulletins until they first appeared in print  CBS disregarded an embargo when it broke the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping in       using live on the air reporting  Radio networks scooped print outlets with news of the      presidential election             In March       White was named vice president and general manager in charge of news at CBS     As the first head of CBS News  he began to build an organization that soon established a legendary reputation         In       White hired Edward R  Murrow  and sent him to London in      to run CBS Radio s European operation         White led a staff that would come to include Charles Collingwood  William L  Shirer  Eric Sevareid     Bill Downs  John Charles Daly  Joseph C  Harsch        Cecil Brown  Elmer Davis  Quincy Howe  H  V  Kaltenborn  Robert Trout      and Lewis Shollenberger       CBS was getting its ducks in a row for the biggest news story in history  World War II   wrote radio historian John Dunning          Television edit  Upon becoming commercial station WCBW  channel    now WCBS TV  in       the pioneer CBS television station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs  at      and      p m  weekdays  anchored by Richard Hubbell  Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph  When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December          WCBW  which was usually off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off   took to the air at      p m  with an extensive special report  The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television  WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the Grand Central studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack  The WCBW special report that night lasted less than    minutes  But that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in      and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts  As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC  the unscheduled live news broadcast on December    was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time   Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war  In May       WCBW  like almost all television stations  sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were canceled  since the station temporarily suspended studio operations  resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films  This was primarily because much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war related technical research  and to prolong the life of the early  unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts    Douglas Edwards on the CBS news set in       In May       as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies  WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned  briefly anchored by Ned Calmer  and then by Everett Holles      After the war  expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule   whose call letters were changed to WCBS TV in        first anchored by Milo Boulton  and later by Douglas Edwards  On May          Edwards began anchoring CBS Television News  a regular    minute nightly newscast on the CBS television network  including WCBS TV  It aired every weeknight at      p m   and was the first regularly scheduled  network television news program featuring an anchor  the nightly Lowell Thomas NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC s WNBT now WNBC for a time in the early     s and the previously mentioned Richard Hubbell  Ned Calmer  Everett Holles and Milo Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid     s  but these were local television broadcasts seen only in New York City   NBC s offering at the time  NBC Television Newsreel  which premiered in February        was simply film footage with voice narration  In       the name of the nightly newscast was changed to Douglas Edwards with the News  and the following year  it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts  thanks to a new coaxial cable connection  prompting Edwards to use the greeting  Good evening everyone  coast to coast   The broadcast was renamed the CBS Evening News when Walter Cronkite replaced Edwards in           Edwards remained with CBS News with various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April           Broadcast history edit  The information on programs listed in
