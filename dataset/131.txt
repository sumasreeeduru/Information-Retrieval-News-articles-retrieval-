       Reeve  England   From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Originally in Anglo Saxon England the reeve was a senior official with local responsibilities under the Crown  e g   as the chief magistrate of a town or district  Subsequently  after the Norman conquest  it was an office held by a man of lower rank  appointed as manager of a manor and overseer of the peasants  In this later role  historian H  R  Loyn observes   he is the earliest English specialist in estate management       Anglo Saxon status Cyning  sovereign    theling  prince   Ealdorman

of Northern Germany  was an administrative officer who generally ranked lower than the ealdorman or earl  The Old English word  er fa was originally a general term  but soon acquired a more technical meaning  Land was divided into a large number of hides an area containing enough farmable land to support one household  Ten hides constituted a tithings  and the families living upon it  in theory     families  were obliged to undertake an early form of neighbourhood watch  by a collective responsibility system called frankpledge  Tithings were organised into groups of     called hundreds due to containing     hides  in modern times  these ancient hundreds still mostly retain their historic boundaries  despite each generally now containing vastly more than a mere     families  Each hundred was supervised by a constable  and groups of hundreds were combined to form shires  with each shire being under the control of an earl  Each unit had a court  and an officer to implement decisions of that court  the reeve  Thus different types of reeves were attested  including high reeve  town reeve  port reeve  shire reeve  predecessor to the sheriff      reeve of the hundred  and the reeve of a manor  The word is often rendered in Latin as prefectus  Modern English prefect   by the historian Bede  and some early Anglo Saxon charters  West Saxon charters prefer to reserve the term prefectus for the ealdormen  earls  themselves   After the Conquest edit  After the Norman conquest  feudalism was introduced  forming a parallel administrative system to the local courts  The feudal system organised land on a manorial basis  with stewards acting as managers for the landlords  The Norman term describing the court functionary bailiff came to be used for reeves associated with lower level courts  and with the equivalent role in the feudal courts of landlords  Courts fulfilled administrative  as well as judicial  functions  and on the manorial level its decisions could concern mundane field management  not just legal disputes  The manorial bailiff thus could be set tasks such as ensuring certain crops were gathered  as well as those like enforcing debt repayment  Sometimes  bailiffs would have assistants to carry out these tasks  and the term reeve now came to be used for this position someone essentially assisting the steward  and sometimes a bailiff  by effectively performing day to day supervision of the work done on the land within a particular manor  This reeve has been described as  the pivot man of the manorial system   He had to oversee the work which the peasants were bound to perform  as an obligation attached to their holding of land in the Manor  for the lord of the manor on the demesne land  such reeves acted generally as the overseer of the serfs and peasants on the estate  He was also responsible for many aspects of the finances of the manor such as the sale of produce  collection of monies and payment of accounts  He was usually himself a peasant  and was chosen once a year  generally at Michaelmas  In some manors the reeve was appointed by the lord of the manor  but in others he was elected by the peasants  subject or not to a right of veto by the lord  It depended on the custom of the manor  but there was an increasing tendency for election to be favoured  No doubt an elected reeve was more willingly obeyed  and sometimes the peasants generally would be made financially liable if an elected reeve defaulted     Although this reeve was subject to the steward  the steward might not always be resident within the manor  and may manage many  and would not usually concern himself with day to day working  A good reeve who carried out his duties efficiently  and was trusted by the lord and the peasants alike  was likely to stay in office more or less permanently  By the   th century the reeve was often a permanent officer of the manor  With the subsequent decline of the feudal system  and the subversion of its courts by the introduction of Justices of the Peace  magistrates   this use of reeve fell out of practice   Depiction by Chaucer edit  There is an exceptional literary portrait of a reeve in the second half of the   th century  The reeve is one of the pilgrims who are making their way to Canterbury in Chaucer s Canterbury Tales and the Prologue paints a vivid picture of this man  who had originally been a carpenter but had served as reeve of a manor for many years and had grown old in service   Chaucer describes a highly efficient servant  impossible for any man to deceive or outwit  never in debt and knowing exactly how much the manor should produce  It is an early picture of a completely reliable accountant  rather a cold individual but indispensable      See also edit  High reeve Reeve  Canada
