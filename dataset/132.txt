       Communications satellite  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Artificial satellite that relays radio signals  An Advanced Extremely High Frequency communications orion satellite centre relays secure communications for the United States  and other allied countries  A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder  it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth  Communications satellites are used for television  telephone  radio  internet  and military applications  There are about       communications satellites in Earth s orbit  used by both private and government organizations      Many are in geostationary orbit        miles         km  above the equator  so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky  so the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it  The high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth   The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points      Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies  To avoid signal interference  international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or  bands  certain organizations are allowed to use  This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference      Contents    History   Satellite orbits      Low Earth orbit  LEO      Satellite constellation     Medium Earth orbit  MEO

geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by Arthur C  Clarke  along with Vahid K  Sanadi building on work by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky   In October       Clarke published an article titled  Extraterrestrial Relays  in the British magazine Wireless World     The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals  Thus  Arthur C  Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the communications satellite and the term  Clarke Belt  employed as a description of the orbit     Decades later a project named Communication Moon Relay was a telecommunication project carried out by the United States Navy  Its objective was to develop a secure and reliable method of wireless communication by using the Moon as a passive reflector and a natural communications satellite  The first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik    Put into orbit by the Soviet Union on October          it was equipped with an on board radio transmitter that worked on two frequencies         and         MHz  Sputnik   was launched as a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development  However  it was not placed in orbit for the purpose of sending data from one point on earth to another  The first satellite to relay communications was Pioneer    an intended lunar probe that was launched on October           Though the spacecraft only made it about halfway to the moon  it flew high enough to carry out the proof of concept relay of telemetry across the world  first from Cape Canaveral to Manchester  England  then from Hawaii to Cape Canaveral  and finally  across the world from Hawaii to Manchester     The first satellite purpose built to relay communications was NASA s Project SCORE in       which used a tape recorder to store and forward voice messages  It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U S  President Dwight D  Eisenhower     Courier  B  built by Philco  launched in       was the world s first active repeater satellite  The first artificial satellite used solely to further advances in global communications was a balloon named Echo       Echo   was the world s first artificial communications satellite capable of relaying signals to other points on Earth  It soared       kilometres        mi  above the planet after its Aug           launch  Launched by NASA  Echo   was a    metre      ft  aluminized PET film balloon that served as a passive reflector for radio communications  The world s first inflatable satellite   or  satelloon   as they were informally known   helped lay the foundation of today s satellite communications  The idea behind a communications satellite is simple  Send data up into space and beam it back down to another spot on the globe  Echo   accomplished this by essentially serving as an enormous mirror     stories tall  that could be used to reflect communications signals  There are two major classes of communications satellites  passive and active  Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source  toward the direction of the receiver  With passive satellites  the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite  and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver   Since the satellite is so far above Earth  the radio signal is attenuated due to free space path loss  so the signal received on Earth is very  very weak  Active satellites  on the other hand  amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground     Passive satellites were the first communications satellites  but are little used now  Telstar was the second active  direct relay communications satellite  Belonging to AT T as part of a multi national agreement between AT T  Bell Telephone Laboratories  NASA  the British General Post Office  and the French National PTT  Post Office  to develop satellite communications  it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on July           in the first privately sponsored space launch  Relay   was launched on December           and it became the first satellite to transmit across the Pacific Ocean on November              An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the Hughes Aircraft Company s Syncom    launched on July           Syncom   was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit  It revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed  but because it still had north south motion  special equipment was needed to track it  Its successor  Syncom   was the first geostationary communications satellite  Syncom   obtained a geosynchronous orbit  without a north south motion  making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky  Beginning with the Viking program  a  all Mars landers  aside from Mars Pathfinder  have used orbiting spacecraft as communications satellites for relaying their data to Earth  The landers use UHF transmitters to send their data to the orbiters  which then relay the data to Earth using either X band or Ka band frequencies  These higher frequencies  along with more powerful transmitters and larger antennas  permit the orbiters to send the data much faster than the landers could manage transmitting directly to Earth  which conserves valuable time on the receiving antennas       Satellite orbits edit  Communications satellites usually have one of three primary types of orbit  while other orbital classifications are used to further specify orbital details   Geostationary satellites have a geostationary orbit  GEO   which is        miles         km  from Earth s surface  This orbit has the special characteristic that the apparent position of the satellite in the sky when viewed by a ground observer does not change  the satellite appears to  stand still  in the sky   This is because the satellite s orbital period is the same as the rotation rate of the Earth   The advantage of this orbit is that ground antennas do not have to track the satellite across the sky  they can be fixed to point at the location in the sky the satellite appears  Medium Earth orbit  MEO  satellites are closer to Earth  Orbital altitudes range from       to        kilometres        to        mi  above Earth  The region below medium orbits is referred to as low Earth orbit  LEO   and is about     to       kilometres     to       mi  above Earth  As satellites in MEO and LEO orbit the Earth faster  they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on Earth continually like a geostationary satellite  but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and  set  when they go behind the Earth  Therefore  to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites  so one will always be in the sky for transmission of communication signals   However  due to their relatively small distance to the Earth their signals are stronger  clarification needed   Low Earth orbit  LEO  edit  Main article  Low Earth orbit  Low Earth orbit in Cyan A low Earth orbit  LEO  typically is a circular orbit about     to       kilometres     to       mi  above the earth s surface and  correspondingly  a period  time to revolve around the earth  of about    minutes      Because of their low altitude  these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly       kilometres      mi  from the sub satellite point  In addition  satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly  So even for local applications  many satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity  Low Earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and  due to proximity to the ground  do not require as high signal strength  Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source  so the effect is dramatic   Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost  In addition  there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions   Satellite constellation edit  Main article  Satellite constellation A group of satellites working in concert is known as a satellite constellation  Two such constellations  intended to provide satellite phone services  primarily to remote areas  are the Iridium and Globalstar systems  The Iridium system has    satellites  It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part   This will be the case with the CASCADE system of Canada s CASSIOPE communications satellite  Another system using this store and forward method is Orbcomm   Medium Earth orbit  MEO  edit  Main article  Medium Earth orbit A MEO is a satellite in orbit somewhere between       and        kilometres        and        mi  above the earth s surface   MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in functionality  MEO satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites  usually between   and   hours  MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than LEO satellites  A MEO satellite s longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a MEO network than a LEO network  One disadvantage is that a MEO satellite s distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a LEO satellite  although these limitations are not as severe as those of a GEO satellite  Like LEOs  these satellites do not maintain a stationary distance from the earth   This is in contrast to the geostationary orbit  where satellites are always        kilometres         mi  from the earth  Typically the orbit of a medium earth orbit satellite is about        kilometres         mi  above earth  In various patterns  these satellites make the trip around earth in anywhere from   to   hours   Examples edit  In       the communications satellite  Telstar  was launched  It was a medium earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high speed telephone signals  Although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon  its major drawback was soon realised  Because its orbital period of about     hours did not match the Earth s rotational period of    hours  continuous coverage was impossible  It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage  In      the first four of a constellation of    MEO satellites was launched  The O b satellites provide broadband internet services  in particular to remote locations and maritime and in flight use  and orbit at an altitude of       kilometres        mi        Geostationary orbit  GEO  edit  Main article  Geostationary orbit  Geostationary orbit To an observer on Earth  a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless  in a fixed position in the sky   This is because it revolves around the Earth at Earth s own angular velocity  one revolution per sidereal day  in an equatorial orbit   A geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellite s motion  This is relatively inexpensive  In applications that require many ground antennas  such as DirecTV distribution  the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit   Examples edit  The first geostationary satellite was Syncom    launched on August           and used for communication across the Pacific starting with television coverage of the      Summer Olympics  Shortly after Syncom    Intelsat I  aka Early Bird  was launched on April          and placed in orbit at     west longitude  It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the Atlantic Ocean  On November          Canada s first geostationary satellite serving the continent  Anik A   was launched by Telesat Canada  with the United States following suit with the launch of Westar   by Western Union on April           On May           the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be three axis stabilized was launched  the experimental satellite ATS   built for NASA  After the launches of the Telstar through Westar   satellites  RCA Americom  later GE Americom  now SES  launched Satcom   in        It was Satcom   that was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels such as WTBS  now TBS   HBO  CBN  now Freeform  and The Weather Channel become successful  because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV headends using the satellite   Additionally  it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States  like ABC  NBC  and CBS  to distribute programming to their local affiliate stations   Satcom   was widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar   in America     transponders as opposed to the    of Westar     resulting in lower transponder usage costs  Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers  By       Hughes Space and Communications  now Boeing Satellite Development Center  had built nearly    percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide  Other major satellite manufacturers include Space Systems Loral  Orbital Sciences Corporation with the Star Bus series  Indian Space Research Organisation  Lockheed Martin  owns the former RCA Astro Electronics GE Astro Space business   Northrop Grumman  Alcatel Space  now Thales Alenia Space  with the Spacebus series  and Astrium   Molniya orbit edit  Main article  Molniya orbit Geostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator  This will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes  affecting connectivity and causing multipath interference  caused by signals reflecting off the ground and into the ground antenna   Thus  for areas close to the North  and South  Pole  a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon  Therefore  Molniya orbit satellites have been launched  mainly in Russia  to alleviate this problem  Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases  The Molniya orbit is highly inclined  guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit   Elevation is the extent of the satellite s position above the horizon  Thus  a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of    degrees   The Molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes  during which its ground footprint moves only slightly  Its period is one half day  so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution  In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites  plus in orbit spares  can provide uninterrupted coverage  The first satellite of the Molniya series was launched on April          and was used for experimental transmission of TV signals from a Moscow uplink station to downlink stations located in Siberia and the Russian Far East  in Norilsk  Khabarovsk  Magadan and Vladivostok  In November      Soviet engineers created a unique system of national TV network of satellite television  called Orbita  that was based on Molniya satellites   Polar orbit edit  Main article  Polar orbit In the United States  the National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System  NPOESS  was established in      to consolidate the polar satellite operations of NASA  National Aeronautics and Space Administration   NOAA  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   NPOESS manages a number of satellites for various purposes  for example  METSAT for meteorological satellite  EUMETSAT for the European branch of the program  and METOP for meteorological operations  These orbits are sun synchronous  meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day  For example  the satellites in the NPOESS  civilian  orbit will cross the equator  going from south to north  at times      P M        P M   and      P M   Structure edit  Communications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems   Communication Payload  normally composed of transponders  antennas  and switching systems Engines used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit A station keeping tracking and stabilization subsystem used to keep the satellite in the right orbit  with its antennas pointed in the right direction  and its power system pointed towards the sun Power subsystem  used to power the Satellite systems  normally composed of solar cells  and batteries that maintain power during solar eclipse Command and Control subsystem  which maintains communications with ground control stations  The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life cycle  The bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite  Each service  TV  Voice  Internet  radio  requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission  This is typically known as link budgeting and a network simulator can be used to arrive at the exact value   Frequency allocation for satellite systems edit  Allocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning  This is carried out under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union  ITU   To facilitate frequency planning  the world is divided into three regions   Region    Europe  Africa  the Middle East  what was formerly the Soviet Union  and Mongolia Region    North and South America and Greenland Region    Asia  excluding region   areas   Australia  and the southwest Pacific Within these regions  frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services  although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions  Some of the services provided by satellites are   Fixed satellite service  FSS  Broadcasting satellite service  BSS  Mobile satellite service Radionavigation satellite service Meteorological satellite service Applications edit  Telephony edit  Main article  Satellite phone  An Iridium satellite The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony  The fixed Public Switched Telephone Network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an earth station  where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite   The downlink follows an analogous path   Improvements in submarine communications cables through the use of fiber optics caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late   th century  Satellite communications are still used in many applications today  Remote islands such as Ascension Island  Saint Helena  Diego Garcia  and Easter Island  where no submarine cables are in service  need satellite telephones  There are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent  for example large regions of South America  Africa  Canada  China  Russia  and Australia  Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of Antarctica and Greenland  Other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea  a back up for hospitals  military  and recreation  Ships at sea  as well as planes  often use satellite phones      Satellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means  On a large scale  often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area  There are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system  In this example  almost any type of satellite can be used  Satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low Earth orbit satellites  Calls are then forwarded to a satellite teleport connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network    Television edit  Main article  Satellite television As television became the main market  its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large bandwidth to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats   Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio  Direct broadcast satellite  DBS   and Fixed Service Satellite  FSS   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America  especially in Europe  are a bit more ambiguous  Most satellites used for direct to home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS class satellites in North America  but use the same linear polarization as FSS class satellites  Examples of these are the Astra  Eutelsat  and Hotbird spacecraft in orbit over the European continent  Because of this  the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent  and are uncommon in Europe  Fixed Service Satellites use the C band  and the lower portions of the Ku band  They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations  such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming  live shots  and backhauls   as well as being used for distance learning by schools and universities  business television  BTV   Videoconferencing  and general commercial telecommunications  FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends  Free to air satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the Ku band  The Intelsat Americas    Galaxy   R and AMC   satellites over North America provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their Ku band transponders  The American Dish Network DBS service has also recently used FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their SuperDish antenna  due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the FCC s  must carry  regulations  and for more bandwidth to carry HDTV channels  A direct broadcast satellite is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes  usually    to    inches or    to    cm in diameter   Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave Ku band  DBS technology is used for DTH oriented  Direct To Home  satellite TV services  such as DirecTV  DISH Network and Orby TV     in the United States  Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct in Canada  Freesat and Sky in the UK  Ireland  and New Zealand and DSTV in South Africa  Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS  FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception    to   feet    to     m  in diameter for Ku band  and    feet      m  or larger for C band    They use linear polarization for each of the transponders  RF input and output  as opposed to circular polarization used by DBS satellites   but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice  FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late     s to the early     s in the United States in the form of TVRO  TeleVision Receive Only  receivers and dishes  It was also used in its Ku band form for the now defunct Primestar satellite TV service  Some satellites have been launched that have transponders in the Ka band  such as DirecTV s SPACEWAY   satellite  and Anik F   NASA and ISRO         have also launched experimental satellites carrying Ka band beacons recently      Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television  Using Global Positioning System  GPS  technology as a reference  these antennas automatically re aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle  on which the antenna is mounted  is situated   These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners   Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by JetBlue Airways for DirecTV  supplied by LiveTV  a subsidiary of JetBlue   which passengers can view on board on LCD screens mounted in the seats   Radio broadcasting edit  Main article  Satellite radio Satellite radio offers audio broadcast services in some countries  notably the United States  Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent  listening to the same audio programming anywhere  A satellite radio or subscription radio  SR  is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite  which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals  Satellite radio offers a meaningful alternative to ground based radio services in some countries  notably the United States  Mobile services  such as SiriusXM  and Worldspace  allow listeners to roam across an entire continent  listening to the same audio programming anywhere they go  Other services  such as Music Choice or Muzak s satellite delivered content  require a fixed location receiver and a dish antenna  In all cases  the antenna must have a clear view to the satellites  In areas where tall buildings  bridges  or even parking garages obscure the signal  repeaters can be placed to make the signal available to listeners  Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers  by      popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with the arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States  Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings  Later they merged to become the conglomerate SiriusXM  Radio services are usually provided by commercial ventures and are subscription based  The various services are proprietary signals  requiring specialized hardware for decoding and playback  Providers usually carry a variety of news  weather  sports  and music channels  with the music channels generally being commercial free  In areas with a relatively high population density  it is easier and less expensive to reach the bulk of the population with terrestrial broadcasts  Thus in the UK and some other countries  the contemporary evolution of radio services is focused on Digital Audio Broadcasting  DAB  services or HD Radio  rather than satellite radio   Amateur radio edit  Main article  Amateur radio satellite Amateur radio operators have access to amateur satellites  which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic  Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters  and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with UHF or VHF radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as Yagis or dish antennas  Due to launch costs  most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits  and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time  Some satellites also provide data forwarding services using the X    or similar protocols   Internet access edit  Main article  Satellite Internet access After the     s  satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the Internet via broadband data connections  This can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas  and cannot access a broadband connection  or require high availability of services   Military edit  Main article  Military communications satellite Further information  X Band Satellite Communication Communications satellites are used for military communications applications  such as Global Command and Control Systems  Examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the MILSTAR  the DSCS  and the FLTSATCOM of the United States  NATO satellites  United Kingdom satellites  for instance Skynet   and satellites of the former Soviet Union  India has launched its first Military Communication satellite GSAT    its transponders operate in UHF  F  C and Ku band bands      Typically military satellites operate in the UHF  SHF  also known as X band  or EHF  also known as Ka band  frequency bands   Data collection edit  Near ground in situ environmental monitoring equipment  such as weather stations  weather buoys  and radiosondes   may use satellites for one way data transmission or two way telemetry and telecontrol      It may be based on a secondary payload of a weather satellite  as in the case of GOES and METEOSAT and others in the Argos system  or in dedicated satellites  such as SCD   The data rate is typically much lower than in satellite Internet access   See also edit   Commercialization of space History of telecommunication Inter satellite
