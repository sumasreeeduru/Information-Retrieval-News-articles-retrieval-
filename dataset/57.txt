       Information subsidy  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search An information subsidy is the provision of ready to use newsworthy information to the news media by various sources interested in gaining access to media time and space     Typical forms of information subsidies include press releases  as well as press seminars and conferences  This information represents a subsidy to the media  since it lowers the cost of news gathering  Out of the various alternatives available to the media to collect information  investigative work  informal channels and routine sources      the latter channel is the cheapest to monitor and maintain     Relying on information provided by external sources can thus relieve the economic burden and shorten the time to publication  especially when the information is presented in a format  such as an inverted pyramid  and style that can be easily incorporated in news     On the other hand  critics argue that subsidies have the potential to skew the process of news selection by leading journalists to pick stories based on criteria other than their inherent importance and newsworthiness  The content of the coverage  critics contend  is also likely to be influenced  since the subsidised materials are usually biased in favour of the source organisation  From the source s point of view  the ideal goal is to have the news media view reflect as closely as possible their own      References edit     a b Gandy  Jr   Oscar H           Information in health  Subsidized news    Media  Culture   Society                  doi                                Sigal  Leon V          Reporters and officials  The Organization and Politics of Newsmaking  DC Health     Jacobs  Geert          Self reference in press releases   Journal of Pragmatics                   doi         s                         Zoch  Lynn M    Molleda  Juan Carlos          Building a theoretical model of media relations using framing  information subsidies and agenda building    In Botan  C  H    Hazleton  V   eds    Public Relations Theory II  Lawrence Erlbaum  pp                 Retrieved from  https   en wikipedia org w index php title Information subsidy oldid            Categories  JournalismPublic relationsSubsidies       Navigation menu     Personal tools   Not logged inTalkContributionsCreate accountLog in       Namespaces   ArticleTalk       Variants           Views   ReadEditView history       More        Search                    Navigation   Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate      Contribute   HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file      Tools   What links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageWikidata item      Print export   Download as PDFPrintable version      Languages                       Edit links        This page was last edited on    October       at        UTC   Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License  additional terms may apply   By using this site  you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy  Wikipedia  is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation  Inc   a non profit organization    Privacy policy About Wikipedia Disclaimers Contact Wikipedia Mobile view Developers Statistics Cookie statement
