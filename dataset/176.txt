the same functions that griots perform  Francis Bebey writes about the griot in African Music  A People s Art    The West African griot is a troubadour  the counterpart of the medieval European minstrel    The griot knows everything that is going on    He is a living archive of the people s traditions    The virtuoso talents of the griots command universal admiration  This virtuosity is the culmination of long years of study and hard work under the tuition of a teacher who is often a father or uncle  The profession is by no means a male prerogative  There are many women griots whose talents as singers and musicians are equally remarkable      Terms   griot  and  jali  edit  The Manding term jeliya  meaning  musicianhood   sometimes refers to the knowledge of griots  indicating the hereditary nature of the class  Jali comes from the root word jali or djali  blood   This is also the title given to griots in regions within the former Mali Empire  Though the term  griot  is more common in English  some  such as poet Bakari Sumano  prefer the term jeli   In the Mali Empire edit   Griots of Sambala  king of M dina  Fula people  Mali        The Mali Empire  Malinke Empire   at its height in the middle of the   th century  extended from central Africa  today s Chad and Niger  to West Africa  today s Mali and Senegal   The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita  whose exploits remain celebrated in Mali today  In the Epic of Sundiata  Nar  Maghann Konat  offered his son Sundiata Keita a griot  Balla Fass k   to advise him in his reign  Balla Fass k  is considered the founder of the Kouyat  line of griots that exists to this day  Each aristocratic family of griots accompanied a higher ranked family of warrior kings or emperors  called jatigi  In traditional culture  no griot can be without a jatigi  and no jatigi can be without a griot  However  the jatigi can loan his griot to another jatigi  Most villages also had their own griot  who told tales of births  deaths  marriages  battles  hunts  affairs  and many other things   In Mande society edit  In Mande society  the jeli was an historian  advisor  arbitrator  praise singer  patronage   and storyteller  They essentially served as history books  preserving ancient stories and traditions through song  Their tradition was passed down through generations  The name jeli means  blood  in Manika language  They were believed to have deep connections to spiritual  social  or political powers  Speech was believed to have power in its capacity to recreate history and relationships  Despite the authority of griots and the perceived power of their songs  griots are not treated as positively in West Africa as we may imagine  Thomas A  Hale wrote   Another  reason for ambivalence towards griots  is an ancient tradition that marks them as a separate people categorized all too simplistically as members of a  caste   a term that has come under increasing attack as a distortion of the social structure in the region  In the worst case  that difference meant burial for griots in trees rather than in the ground in order to avoid polluting the earth  Conrad and Frank            Although these traditions are changing  griots and people of griot heritage still find it difficult to marry outside of their social group      This discrimination is now deemed illegal   Musical instruments used by griots edit  In addition to being singers and social commentators  griots are often skilled instrumentalists  Their instruments include the kora  the khalam  or xalam   the goje  or n ko in the Mandinka language   the balafon  and the ngoni  The kora is a long necked lute like instrument with    strings  The xalam is a variation of the kora  and usually consists of fewer than five strings  Both have gourd bodies that act as resonator  The ngoni is also similar to these two instruments  with five or six strings  The balafon is a wooden xylophone  while the goje is a stringed instrument played with a bow  much like a fiddle  According to the Encyclop dia Britannica   West African plucked lutes such as the konting  khalam  and the nkoni  which was noted by Ibn Ba    ah in       may have originated in ancient Egypt  The khalam is claimed to be the ancestor of the banjo  Another long necked lute is the ramkie of South Africa      Griots also wrote stories that children enjoyed listening to  These stories were passed down to their children   Griots in present day edit  Today  performing is one of the most common functions of a griot  Their range of exposure has widened  and many griots now travel internationally to sing and play the kora or other instruments   Bakari Sumano  head of the Association of Bamako Griots in Mali from      to       was an internationally known advocate for the significance of the griot in West African society   In popular culture edit  Film and theater edit  Camille Yarbrough wrote a play called Tales and Tunes of an

studio album by New Jersey experimental hip hop outfit D lek         The Griot s Footsteps  Antilles Verve Records  is an album by cornetist and composer Graham Haynes  Literature edit  Alex Haley s novel Roots references a griot who passed down his family history through the oral tradition  When Haley traces his history  passing from his previous generation through the slave time  back to Africa  he thought there should be griots telling his history and the history of his ancestor  known in the family as  The African   who was captured in the bushes as he was seeking timber to make a talking drum  When Haley arrived in Africa to do research for his book  he believed he had found griots telling his history  Through them  he learned the ancestor s identity  Kunta Kinte  Since he first heard the story from his grandmother and then from his older cousin  he believed that these family members were griots themselves until someone put the story to writing  He later learned that his cousin had died within an hour of his arrival at the village  This story also illustrates the complexities of oral tradition  particularly when approached without expert knowledge  In       it was shown by Donald Wright that the story of Kunta Kinte had been manufactured by a well wisher     Following the publication of Roots  this story was being told in multiple versions with various embellishments
