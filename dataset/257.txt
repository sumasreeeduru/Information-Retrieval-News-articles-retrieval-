in       during the reign of King Christian IV  a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king s honour  The old site east of the Aker river was not abandoned however and the village of Oslo remained as a suburb outside the city gates  The suburb called Oslo was eventually included in the city proper  In      the name of the suburb was transferred to the whole city  while the suburb was renamed  Gamlebyen   literally  the Old town   to avoid confusion              The Old Town is an area within the administrative district Gamle Oslo  The previous names are reflected in street names like Oslo gate  Oslo street      and Oslo hospital       Toponymy edit  For full article  see History of Oslo s name The origin of the name Oslo has been the subject of much debate  It is certainly derived from Old Norse and was   in all probability   originally the name of a large farm at Bj rvika  but the meaning of that name is disputed  Modern linguists generally interpret the original  slo   slo or  nslo as either  Meadow at the Foot of a Hill  or  Meadow Consecrated to the Gods   with both considered equally likely      Erroneously  it was once assumed that Oslo meant  the mouth of the Lo river   a supposed previous name for the river Alna  However  not only has no evidence been found of a river  Lo  predating the work where Peder Clauss n Friis first proposed this etymology  but the very name is ungrammatical in Norwegian  the correct form would have been Loaros  cf  Nidaros       The name Lo is now believed to be a back formation arrived at by Friis in support of his  idea about  etymology for Oslo       Seal edit  Main article  Seal of Oslo Oslo is one of very few cities in Norway  besides Bergen and T nsberg  that does not have a formal coat of arms  but which uses a city seal instead      The seal of Oslo shows the city s patron saint  St  Hallvard  with his attributes  the millstone and arrows  with a naked woman at his feet  He is seated on a throne with lion decorations  which at the time was also commonly used by the Norwegian kings       Other names edit  Oslo has various nicknames and names in other languages  The city is sometimes known under the nickname  The Tiger City   Norwegian  Tigerstaden   probably inspired by an      poem by Bj rnstjerne Bj rnson which referenced then Christiania in central Oslo  The nickname is mostly used by Norwegians from out of town  and rarely by people from the Oslo region       History edit    Oslo timeline  major events See also expanded timeline   CA

 and Denmark continued to claim the area until       According to the Norse sagas  Oslo was founded around      by Harald Hardrada      Recent archaeological research however has uncovered Christian

century later  Norway was the weaker part in a personal union with Denmark  and Oslo s role was reduced to that of provincial administrative centre  with the monarchs residing in Copenhagen  The fact that the University of Oslo was founded as late as      had an adverse effect on the development of the nation      Oslo was destroyed several times by fire  and after the fourteenth calamity  in       Christian IV of Denmark and Norway ordered it rebuilt at a new site across the bay  near Akershus Castle and given the name Christiania  Long before this  Christiania had started to establish its stature as a centre of commerce and culture in Norway  The part of the city built starting in      is now often called Kvadraturen because of its orthogonal layout in regular  square blocks      The last Black Death outbreak in Oslo occurred in           In      Christiania once more became a real capital when the union with Denmark was dissolved  Many landmarks were built in the   th century  including the Royal Palace              Storting building  the Parliament               the University  National Theatre and the Stock Exchange  Among the world famous artists who lived here during this period were Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun  the latter was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature   In       Christiania also overtook Bergen and became the most populous city in the country  In      the city was renamed Kristiania  The original name of Oslo was restored in                      edit  Main article  Old Town  Oslo Under the reign of Olaf III of Norway  Oslo became a cultural centre for Eastern Norway  Hallvard Vebj rnsson became the city s patron saint and is depicted on the city s seal  In       Hoved ya Abbey was built  The churches and abbeys became major owners of large tracts of land  which proved important for the city s economic development  especially before the Black Death  On    July       Sverre of Norway and his soldiers attacked Oslo from Hoved ya      During the Middle Ages  Oslo reached its heights in the reign of Haakon V of Norway  He started building Akershus Fortress and was also the first king to reside permanently in the city  which helped to make Oslo the capital of Norway  In the end of the   th century  Hanseatic League traders from Rostock moved into the city and gained major influence in the city  The Black Death came to Norway in      and  like other cities in Europe  the city suffered greatly  The churches  earnings from their land also dropped so much that the Hanseatic traders dominated the city s foreign trade in the   th century     th century edit  Over the years  fire destroyed major parts of the city many times  as many of the city s buildings were built entirely of wood  After the last fire in       which lasted for three days  Christian IV of Denmark decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again  His men built a network of roads in Akershagen near Akershus Castle  He demanded that all citizens should move their shops and workplaces to the newly built city Christiania  named as an honor to the king  The transformation of the city went slowly for the first hundred years  Outside the city  near Vaterland and Gr nland near Old Town  Oslo  a new  unmanaged part of the city grew up filled with citizens of low class status     th century edit  In the   th century  after the Great Northern War  the city s economy boomed with shipbuilding and trade  The strong economy transformed Christiania into a trading port     th century edit  In      the former provincial town of Christiania became the capital of the independent Kingdom of Norway  in a personal union with Sweden  Several state institutions were established and the city s role as a capital initiated a period of rapidly increasing population  The government of this new state needed buildings for its expanding administration and institutions  Several important buildings were erected   The Bank of Norway         the Royal Palace         and the Storting         Large areas of the surrounding Aker municipality were incorporated in            an       The      expansion included Gr nerl kka  Gr nland and Oslo  At that time the area called Oslo  now Gamlebyen or Old Town  was a village or suburb outside the city borders east of Aker river      The population increased from approximately        in      to         in       Christiania expanded its industry from       most importantly around Akerselva   There was a spectacular building boom during the last decades of the   th century  with many new apartment buildings and renewal of the city center  but the boom collapsed in             present edit  In       Oslo merged with Aker  a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was    times larger  thus creating the modern  vastly enlarged Oslo municipality  At the time  Aker was a mostly affluent  green suburban community  and the merger was unpopular in Aker      The municipality developed new areas such as Ullev l garden city             and Torshov              City Hall was constructed in the former slum area of Vika from      to       The municipality of Aker was incorporated into Oslo

fire  King Christian IV of Denmark ordered a new city built with his own name  Oslo remained a poor suburb outside the city border  In the early   th century  Norwegians argued that a name memorialising a Danish king was inappropriate as the name of the capital of Norway  which became fully independent in           In the      Norway terror attacks  Oslo was hit by a bomb blast that ripped through the Government quarter  damaging several buildings including the building that houses the Office of the Prime Minister  Eight people died in the bomb attack       Map of medieval Oslo
