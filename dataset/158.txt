megapixels per frame  HDTV provides about five times as many pixels as SD  standard definition television   The increased resolution provides for a clearer  more detailed picture  In addition  progressive scan and higher frame rates result in a picture with less flicker and better rendering of fast motion     HDTV as is known today first started official broadcasting in      in Japan  under the MUSE Hi Vision analog system     HDTV was widely adopted worldwide in the late     s      History edit  Further information  Analog high definition television system and history of television The term high definition once described a series of television systems originating from August       however  these systems were only high definition when compared to earlier systems that were based on mechanical systems with as few as    lines of resolution  The ongoing competition between companies and nations to create true  HDTV  spanned the entire   th century  as each new system became higher definition than the last  In the     s  this race has continued with  K   K and  K systems  The British high definition TV service started trials in August      and a regular service on   November      using both the  mechanical  Baird     line sequential scan  later to be inaccurately rechristened  progressive   and the  electronic  Marconi EMI     line interlaced systems  The Baird system was discontinued in February          In      France followed with their own     line system  variants of which were also used by a number of other countries  The US NTSC     line system joined in       In      France introduced an even higher resolution standard at     lines  a system that should have been high definition even by today s standards  but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable  All of these systems used interlacing and a     aspect ratio except the     line system which was progressive  actually described at the time by the technically correct term  sequential   and the     line system which started as     and later changed to      The     line system adopted the  at that time  revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the     line with its    Hz frame rate  The     line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth  an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than   MHz  Color broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions  first with the US NTSC color system in       which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same     lines of resolution  European standards did not follow until the     s  when the PAL and SECAM color systems were added to the monochrome     line broadcasts  The NHK  Japan Broadcasting Corporation  began conducting research to  unlock the fundamental mechanism of video and sound interactions with the five human senses  in       after the Tokyo Olympics  NHK set out to create an HDTV system that ended up scoring much higher in subjective tests than NTSC s previously dubbed  HDTV   This new system  NHK Color  created in       included      lines  a     aspect ratio and    Hz refresh rate  The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers  SMPTE   headed by Charles Ginsburg  became the testing and study authority for HDTV technology in the international theater  SMPTE would test HDTV systems from different companies from every conceivable perspective  but the problem of combining the different formats plagued the technology for many years  There were four major HDTV systems tested by SMPTE in the late     s  and in      an SMPTE study group released A Study of High Definition Television Systems   EIA monochrome      aspect ratio       lines     Hz NHK color      aspect ratio       lines     Hz NHK

the mid to late     s  the     line NTSC  and PAL M  systems  as well as the European     line PAL and SECAM systems  are now regarded as standard definition television systems   Analog systems edit  Main article  Analog high definition television system Early HDTV broadcasting used analog technology  but today it is transmitted digitally and uses video compression  In       France started its transmissions with an     lines system  with     active lines   The system was monochrome only  and was used only on VHF for the first French TV channel  It was discontinued in       In       the Soviet Union developed  ransformator  Russian                 meaning Transformer   the first high resolution  definition  television system capable of producing an image composed of       lines of resolution aimed at providing teleconferencing for military command  It was a research project and the system was never deployed by either the military or consumer broadcasting     In       the European Community proposed HD MAC  an analog HDTV system with       lines  A public demonstration took place for the      Summer Olympics in Barcelona  However HD MAC was scrapped in      and the Digital Video Broadcasting  DVB  project was formed  which would foresee development of a digital HDTV standard      Japan edit  In       the Japanese public broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high definition television with a     display aspect ratio     The system  known as Hi Vision or MUSE after its multiple sub Nyquist sampling encoding  MUSE  for encoding the signal  required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution      i      lines   In       the MUSE system was demonstrated for the first time in the United States  using the same     aspect ratio as the Japanese system     Upon visiting a demonstration of MUSE in Washington  US President Ronald Reagan was impressed and officially declared it  a matter of national interest  to introduce HDTV to the US      NHK taped the      Summer Olympics with a Hi Vision camera  weighing    kg      Satellite test broadcasts started June          the first daily high definition programs in the world      with regular testing starting on November          or  Hi Vision Day     dated exactly to refer to its       lines resolution      Regular broadcasting of BS  ch commenced on November           which featured commercial and NHK programming  Several systems were proposed as the new standard for the US  including the Japanese MUSE system  but all were rejected by the FCC because of their higher bandwidth requirements  At this time  the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem  A new standard had to be more efficient  needing less bandwidth for HDTV than the existing NTSC   Decrease of analog HD systems edit  The limited standardization of analog HDTV in the     s did not lead to global HDTV adoption as technical and economic constraints at the time did not permit HDTV to use bandwidths greater than normal television  Early HDTV commercial experiments  such as NHK s MUSE  required over four times the bandwidth of a standard definition broadcast  Despite efforts made to reduce analog HDTV to about twice the bandwidth of SDTV  these television formats were still distributable only by satellite  In Europe too  the HD MAC standard was considered not technically viable          In addition  recording and reproducing an HDTV signal was a significant technical challenge in the early years of HDTV  Sony HDVS   Japan remained the only country with successful public broadcasting of analog HDTV  with seven broadcasters sharing a single channel  citation needed  However the Hi Vision MUSE system also faced commercial issues when it launched on November           Only       HDTV sets were sold by that day  rather than the enthusiastic      million estimation  Hi Vision sets were very expensive  up to US        each  which contributed to its low consumer adaption      A Hi Vision VCR from NEC released at Christmas time retailed for US          In addition  the United States saw Hi Vision MUSE as an outdated system and had already made it clear that it would develop an all digital system      Experts thought the commercial Hi Vision system in      was already eclipsed by digital technology developed in the U S  since       This was an American victory against the Japanese in terms of technological dominance      By mid      prices of receivers were still as high as     million yen  US              On February           a top broadcasting administrator in Japan admitted failure of its analog based HDTV system  saying the U S  digital format would be more likely a worldwide standard      However this announcement drew angry protests from broadcasters and electronic companies who invested heavily into the analog system  As a result  he took back his statement the next day saying that the government will continue to promote Hi Vision MUSE      That year NHK started development of digital television in an attempt to catch back up to America and Europe  This resulted in the ISDB format      Japan started digital satellite and HDTV broadcasting in December            Rise of digital compression edit  High definition digital television was not possible with uncompressed video  which requires a bandwidth exceeding   Gbit s for studio quality HD digital video          Digital HDTV was made possible by the development of discrete cosine transform  DCT  video compression          DCT coding is a lossy image compression technique that was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in           and was later adapted into a motion compensated DCT algorithm for video coding standards such as the H   x formats from      onwards and the MPEG formats from      onwards          Motion compensated DCT compression significantly reduces the amount of bandwidth required for a digital TV signal          By       it had achieved data compression ratios from     to      for near studio quality HDTV transmission  down to        Mbit s bit rate      Between      and       DCT video compression was widely adopted as the video coding standard for HDTV implementations  enabling the development of practical digital HDTV              Dynamic random access memory  DRAM  was also adopted as frame buffer semiconductor memory  with the DRAM semiconductor industry s increased manufacturing and reducing prices important to the commercialization of HDTV      Since       International Telecommunication Union s radio telecommunications sector  ITU R  had been working on creating a global recommendation for Analog HDTV  These recommendations  however  did not fit in the broadcasting bands which could reach home users  The standardization of MPEG   in      led to the acceptance of recommendations ITU R BT          In anticipation of these standards  the Digital Video Broadcasting  DVB  organisation was formed  It was alliance of broadcasters  consumer electronics manufacturers and regulatory bodies  The DVB develops and agrees upon specifications which are formally standardised by ETSI      DVB created first the standard for DVB S digital satellite TV  DVB C digital cable TV and DVB T digital terrestrial TV  These broadcasting systems can be used for both SDTV and HDTV  In the US the Grand Alliance proposed ATSC as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV  Both ATSC and DVB were based on the MPEG   standard  although DVB systems may also be used to transmit video using the newer and more efficient H     MPEG   AVC compression standards  Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth  and foremost for reducing receiver hardware and antenna requirements  citation needed  In       the International Telecommunication Union s radio telecommunications sector  ITU R  set up a working party  IWP      with the aim of setting a single international HDTV standard  One of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame field refresh rate  the world already having split into two camps        Hz and       Hz  largely due to the differences in mains frequency  The IWP     working party considered many views and throughout the     s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas  not least conversion between the two main frame field rates using motion vectors  which led to further developments in other areas  While a comprehensive HDTV standard was not in the end established  agreement on the aspect ratio was achieved  citation needed  Initially the existing     aspect ratio had been the main candidate but  due to the influence of widescreen cinema  the aspect ratio             eventually emerged as being a reasonable compromise between            and the common      widescreen cinema format  An aspect ratio of      was duly agreed upon at the first meeting of the IWP     working party at the BBC s Research and Development establishment in Kingswood Warren  The resulting ITU R Recommendation ITU R BT         Rec        includes the      aspect ratio  a specified colorimetry  and the scan modes     i        actively interlaced lines of resolution  and     p        progressively scanned lines   The British Freeview HD trials used MBAFF  which contains both progressive and interlaced content in the same encoding  citation needed  It also includes the alternative           HDMAC scan format   According to some reports  a mooted     line     p  format      progressively scanned lines  was viewed by some at the ITU as an enhanced television format rather than a true HDTV format      and so was not included  although          i and         p systems for a range of frame and field rates were defined by several US SMPTE standards   citation needed   Inaugural HDTV broadcast in the United States edit  HDTV technology was introduced in the United States in the early     s and made official in      by the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance  a group of television  electronic equipment  communications companies consisting of AT T Bell Labs  General Instrument  Philips  Sarnoff  Thomson  Zenith and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Field testing of HDTV at     sites in the United States was completed August               The first public HDTV broadcast in the United States occurred on July          when the Raleigh  North Carolina television station WRAL HD began broadcasting from the existing tower of WRAL TV southeast of Raleigh  winning a race to be first with the HD Model Station in Washington  D C   which began broadcasting July          with the callsign WHD TV  based out of the facilities of NBC owned and operated station WRC TV              The American Advanced Television Systems Committee  ATSC  HDTV system had its public launch on October           during the live coverage of astronaut John Glenn s return mission to space on board the Space Shuttle Discovery      The signal was transmitted coast to coast  and was seen by the public in science centers  and other public theaters specially equipped to receive and display the broadcast           European HDTV broadcasts edit  Between      and       several European organizations were working on discrete cosine transform  DCT  based digital video coding standards for both SDTV and HDTV  The EU     project by the CMTT and ETSI  along with research by Italian broadcaster RAI  developed a DCT video codec that broadcast near studio quality HDTV transmission at about        Mbps bit rate          The first HDTV transmissions in Europe  albeit not direct to home  began in       when RAI broadcast the      FIFA World Cup using several experimental HDTV technologies  including the digital DCT based EU     codec      the mixed analog digital HD MAC technology  and the analog MUSE technology  The matches were shown in   cinemas in Italy  where the tournament was played  and   in Spain  The connection with Spain was made via the Olympus satellite link from Rome to Barcelona and then with a fiber optic connection from Barcelona to Madrid          After some HDTV transmissions in Europe  the standard was abandoned in       to be replaced by a digital format from DVB      The first regular broadcasts started on January         when the Belgian company Euro     launched the HD  channel with the traditional Vienna New Year s Concert  Test transmissions had been active since the IBC exhibition in September       but the New Year s Day broadcast marked the official launch of the HD  channel  and the official start of direct to home HDTV in Europe      Euro      a division of the former and now bankrupt Belgian TV services company Alfacam  broadcast HDTV channels to break the pan European stalemate of  no HD broadcasts mean no HD TVs bought means no HD broadcasts      and kick start HDTV interest in Europe      The HD  channel was initially free to air and mainly comprised sporting  dramatic  musical and other cultural events broadcast with a multi lingual soundtrack on a rolling schedule of   or   hours per day  citation needed  These first European HDTV broadcasts used the     i format with MPEG   compression on a DVB S signal from SES s Astra  H satellite  Euro     transmissions later changed to MPEG   AVC compression on a DVB S  signal in line with subsequent broadcast channels in Europe  citation needed  Despite delays in some countries      the number of European HD channels and viewers has risen steadily since the first HDTV broadcasts  with SES s annual Satellite Monitor market survey for      reporting more than     commercial channels broadcasting in HD from Astra

million via Astra satellites       In December       the United Kingdom became the first European country to deploy high definition content using the new DVB T  transmission standard  as specified in the Digital TV Group  DTG  D book  on digital terrestrial television  citation needed  The Freeview HD service currently contains    HD channels  as of April      update   and was rolled out region by region across the UK in accordance with the digital switchover process  finally being completed in October       However  Freeview HD is not the first HDTV service over digital terrestrial television in Europe  Italy s Rai HD channel started broadcasting in     i on April          using the DVB T transmission standard  citation needed  In October       France deployed five high definition channels using DVB T transmission standard on digital terrestrial distribution  citation needed   Notation edit  HDTV broadcast systems are identified with three major parameters   Frame size in pixels is defined as number of horizontal pixels   number of vertical pixels  for example            or              Often the number of horizontal pixels is implied from context and is omitted  as in the case of    p and     p  Scanning system is identified with the letter p for progressive scanning or i for interlaced scanning  Frame rate is identified as number of video frames per second  For interlaced systems  the number of frames per second should be specified  but it is not uncommon to see the field rate incorrectly used instead  If all three parameters are used  they are specified in the following form   frame size  scanning system  frame or field rate  or  frame size   frame or field rate  scanning system       Often  frame size or frame rate can be dropped if its value is implied from context  In this case  the remaining numeric parameter is specified first  followed by the scanning system  citation needed  For example           p   identifies progressive scanning format with    frames per second  each frame being       pixels wide and       pixels high  The     i   or     i   notation identifies interlaced scanning format with    frames     fields  per second  each frame being       pixels wide and       pixels high  The     i   or     i   notation identifies interlaced scanning format with    frames     fields  per second  each frame being       pixels wide and       pixels high  The    p   notation identifies progressive scanning format with    frames per second  each frame being     pixels high        pixels horizontally are implied  citation needed  Systems using    Hz support three scanning rates    i    p and   p  while    Hz systems support a much wider set of frame rates       i    i        p    p       p    p       p and   p  In the days of standard definition television  the fractional rates were often rounded up to whole numbers  e g        p was often called   p  or      i was often called   i  Sixty Hertz high definition television supports both fractional and slightly different integer rates  therefore strict usage of notation is required to avoid ambiguity  Nevertheless       p      i is almost universally called   i  likewise       p is called   p  citation needed  For the commercial naming of a product  the frame rate is often dropped and is implied from context  e g   a     i television set   A frame rate can also be specified without a resolution  For example    p means    progressive scan frames per second  and   i means    interlaced frames per second      There is no single standard for HDTV color support  Colors are typically broadcast using a     bits per channel  YUV color space but  depending on the underlying image generating technologies of the receiver  are then subsequently converted to a RGB color space using standardized algorithms  When transmitted directly through the Internet  the colors are typically pre converted to   bit RGB channels for additional storage savings with the assumption that it will only be viewed only on a  sRGB  computer screen  As an added benefit to the original broadcasters  the losses of the pre conversion essentially make these files unsuitable for professional TV re

standards for broadcasting HDTV also handle the      aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or anamorphic stretching  thus increasing the effective image resolution  A very high resolution source may require more bandwidth than available in order to be transmitted without loss of fidelity  The lossy compression that is used in all digital HDTV storage and transmission systems will distort the received picture  when compared to the uncompressed source   Standard frame or field rates edit  ATSC and DVB define the following frame rates for use with the various broadcast standards                  Hz  film looking frame rate compatible with NTSC clock speed standards     Hz  international film and ATSC high definition material     Hz  PAL film  DVB standard definition and high

    Hz  ATSC high definition material  The optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image s characteristics  For best fidelity to the source the transmitted field ratio  lines  and frame rate should match those of the source  PAL  SECAM and NTSC frame rates technically apply only to analogue standard definition television  not to digital or high definition broadcasts  However  with the rollout of digital broadcasting  and later HDTV broadcasting  countries retained their heritage systems  HDTV in former PAL and SECAM countries operates at a frame rate of       Hz  while HDTV in former NTSC countries operates at       Hz       Types of media edit  High definition image sources include terrestrial broadcast  direct broadcast

mm photographic film used for cinema projection has a much higher image resolution than HDTV systems  and is exposed and projected at a rate of    frames per second  frame s   To be shown on standard television  in PAL system countries  cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of    frame s  causing a speedup of     percent  which is generally considered acceptable  In NTSC system countries  the TV scan rate of    frame s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted  and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called     pulldown  Over each successive pair of film frames  one is held for three video fields       of a second  and the next is held for two video fields       of a second   giving a total time for the two frames of      of a second and thus achieving the correct average film frame rate  Non cinematic HDTV video recordings intended for broadcast are typically recorded either in    p or     i format as determined by the broadcaster     p is commonly used for Internet distribution of high definition video  because most computer monitors operate in progressive scan mode     p also imposes less strenuous storage and decoding requirements
