presenter Photographer Pundit   commentator   Journalism portal Category  Journalismvte In journalism  a source is a person  publication  or other record or document that gives timely information  Outside journalism  sources are sometimes known as  news sources   Examples of sources include but are not limited to official records  publications or broadcasts  officials in government or business  organizations or corporations  witnesses of crime  accidents or other events  and people involved with or affected by a news event or issue  According to Shoemaker        and McQuail         there are a multitude of factors that tend to condition the acceptance of sources as bona fide by investigative journalists  Reporters are expected to develop and cultivate sources  especially if they regularly cover a specific topic  known as a  beat   Beat reporters must  however  be cautious of becoming too close to their sources  Reporters often  but not always  give greater leeway to sources with little experience  For example  sometimes a person will say they don t want to talk  and then proceed to talk  if that person is not a public figure  reporters are less likely to use that information  Journalists are also encouraged to be skeptical without being cynical  as per the saying  If your mother says she loves you  check it out   popularized by the City News Bureau of Chicago     As a rule of thumb  but especially when reporting on controversy  reporters are expected to use multiple sources   Contents    Using confidential information   Anonymous sources   Sex with sources   Not on tape   Attribution      Ethics      Speaking terms      See also   Notes   References   External links   Using confidential information edit  Off the record material is often valuable and reporters may be eager to use it  so sources wishing to ensure the confidentiality of certain information are generally advised to discuss the  terms of use  before disclosing the information  if possible  Some journalists and news organizations have policies against accepting information  off the record   because they believe it interferes with their ability to report truthfully  or because they suspect it may be intended to mislead them or the public  Even if writers cannot report certain information directly  they can use  off the record  information to uncover related facts  or to find other sources who are willing to speak on the record  This is especially useful in investigative journalism  Information about a surprise event or breaking news  whether on or off the record  is known as a  tip off   Information that leads to the uncovering of more interesting information is called a  lead    Anonymous sources edit  The identity of anonymous sources is sometimes revealed to senior editors or a news organization s lawyers  who would be considered bound by the same confidentiality as the journalist   Lawyers are generally protected from subpoena in these cases by attorney client privilege   Legal staff may need to give counsel about whether it is advisable to publish certain information  or about court proceedings that may attempt to learn confidential information  Senior editors are in the loop to prevent reporters from fabricating non existent anonymous sources and to provide a second opinion about how to use the information obtained  how to or how not to identify sources  and whether other options should be pursued  The use of anonymous sources has always been controversial  Some news outlets insist that anonymous sources are the only way to obtain certain information  while others prohibit the use of unnamed sources at all times     News organizations may impose safeguards  such as requiring that information from an anonymous source be corroborated by a second source before it can be printed  But prominent reports based on anonymous sources have sometimes been proved to be incorrect  For instance  much of the O  J  Simpson reporting from unnamed sources was later deemed inaccurate     Newsweek retracted a story about a Qur an s allegedly being flushed down a toilet the story had been based upon one unnamed military source     The Los Angeles Times retracted an article that implicated Sean  Diddy  Combs in the beating of Tupac Shakur     The original article was based on documents and several unnamed sources  When reporting on the original story  the Associated Press noted that   n one of the sources was named      After the embarrassment  a news organization will often  clamp down  on the guidelines for using unnamed sources  but those guidelines are often forgotten after the scandal dies down  citation needed  One study found that large newspapers  use of anonymous sources dropped dramatically between      and       The Project for Excellence in Journalism  a research group  found use of anonymous sources dropped from    percent of all articles in      to just seven percent in          following widespread embarrassment of media after the Bush administration claims that Iraq had WMD were found to be without basis   Sex with sources edit  This practice is generally not well seen     though by the late      s journalists who practiced it were no longer fired              Lengthy lists of reporters  sexual involvement with sources were published by American Journalism Review     and by The Los Angeles Times       Not on tape edit  Whether in a formal  sit down interview setting or an impromptu meeting on the street  some sources request that all or part of the encounter not be captured in an audio or video recording   tape    but continue speaking to the reporter  As long as the interview is not confidential  the reporter may report the information given by the source  even repeating direct quotes  perhaps scribbled on a notepad or recalled from memory   This often shows up in broadcasts as  John Brown declined to be interviewed on camera  but said  or simply  a spokesperson said   Some interview subjects are uncomfortable being recorded  Some are afraid they will be inarticulate or feel like a fool if the interview is broadcast  Others might be uncooperative or distrust the motives or competence of the journalist  and wish to prevent them from being able to broadcast an unflattering sound bite or part of the interview out of context  Professional public relations officers know that having the reporter repeat their words  rather than being heard directly on the air  will blunt the effect of their words  citation needed  By refusing to be taped or on the air  a person avoids having an audience see or hear them being uncomfortable  if they have unpleasant news   it also permits the individual to be anonymous or identified only by title   Attribution edit  In journalism  attribution is the identification of the source of reported information  Journalists  ethical codes normally address the issue of attribution  which is sensitive because in the course of their work  journalists may receive information from sources who wish to remain anonymous  In investigative journalism  important news stories often depend on such information  For example  the Watergate scandal which led to the downfall of U S  president Richard Nixon was in part exposed by information revealed by an anonymous source   Deep Throat   to investigative reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein   Ethics edit  Divulging the identity of a confidential source is frowned upon by groups representing journalists in many democracies              In many countries  journalists have no special legal status  and may be required to divulge their sources in the course of a criminal investigation  as any other citizen would be  Even in jurisdictions that grant journalists special legal protections  journalists are typically required to testify if they bear witness to a crime      Journalists defend the use of anonymous sources for a variety of reasons   Access  Some sources refuse to share stories without the shield of anonymity  including many government officials      Protection from reprisal or punishment  Other sources are concerned about reprisal or punishment as a result of sharing information with journalists      Illegal activity  Sources which are engaged in illegal activity are usually reluctant to be named in order to avoid self incrimination  This includes sources which are leaking classified information or details of court proceedings which are sealed from the public      The use of anonymous sources is also criticized by some journalists and government officials   Unreliability  It is difficult for a reader to evaluate the reliability and neutrality of a source they cannot identify  and the reliability of the news as a whole is reduced when it relies upon information from anonymous sources          Misinformation and propaganda  Anonymous sources may be reluctant to be identified because the information they are sharing is uncertain or known to them to be untrue  but they want attention or to spread propaganda via the press  such as in the case of the Iraqi aluminum tubes  where tubes known to be useless for uranium refinement were presented as evidence of Saddam Hussein s nuclear weapons program by anonymous sources in the U S  intelligence community in order to build public support for an attack on Iraq                  It may also be used to attack political enemies and present opinions as facts      Several journalists  including Paul Carr  have argued that if an off the record briefing is a deliberate lie journalists should feel permitted to name the source      The Washington Post identified a source who had offered a story in an attempt to discredit media and to distract from the issue at hand with respect to a case of sexual impropriety      Illegal activity  The use of anonymous sources encourages some sources to divulge information which it is illegal for them to divulge  such as the details of a legal settlement  grand jury testimony  or classified information  This information is illegal to disclose for reasons such as national security  protecting witnesses  preventing slander and libel  and ending lawsuits without lengthy  expensive trials and encouraging people to disclose such information defeats the purpose of the disclosure being illegal      In some cases  a reporter may encourage a source to disclose classified information  resulting in accusations of espionage  Fabricated sources  A journalist may fabricate a news story and ascribe the information to anonymous sources to fabricate news  create false detail for a news story  commit plagiarism  or protect themselves from accusations of libel       Speaking terms  edit  There are several categories of  speaking terms   agreements concerning attribution  that cover information conveyed in conversations with journalists  In the UK the following conventions are generally accepted    On the record   all that is said can be quoted and attributed   Unattributable   what is said can be reported but not attributed   Off the record   the information is provided to inform a decision or provide a confidential explanation  not for publication  However  confusion over the precise meaning of  unattributable  and  off the record  has led to more detailed formulations     Designation  Description    Chatham House Rule   Named after Chatham House  the Royal Institute of International Affairs   which introduced the rule in        When a meeting  or part thereof  is held under the Chatham House Rule  participants are free to use the information received  but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker s   nor that of any other participant  may be revealed      Lobby terms        In the UK accredited journalists are allowed in to the otherwise restricted Members  Lobby on the basis that information received there is never attributed and events there are not reported   Lobby terms  are agreed to extend this arrangement to cover discussions that take place elsewhere     Not for attribution       The comments may be quoted directly  but the source may be identified only in general terms  e g    a government insider    In practice such general descriptions may be agreed with the interviewee     On background       The thrust of the briefing may be reported  and the source characterized in general terms as above  but direct quotes may not be used     Deep background   A term that is used in the United States  though not consistently  Most journalists would understand  deep background  to mean that the information may not be included in the article but is used by the journalist to enhance his or her view of the subject matter  or to act as a guide to other leads or sources  Most deep background information is confirmed elsewhere before being reported  Alternative meanings exist  for instance  a White House spokesman said   Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can t be quoted       Deep background can also mean the information received can be used in the story  but cannot be attributed to any source  Depending on the publication  information on deep background is sometimes attributed in terms such as   Publication name  has learned  or  It is understood by  publication name     See also edit
