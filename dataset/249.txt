Western Asia  The body of water is an extension of the Indian Ocean  Gulf of Oman  through the Strait of Hormuz and lies between Iran to the northeast and the Arabian Peninsula to the southwest     The Shatt al Arab river delta forms the northwest shoreline  The body of water is historically and internationally known as the  Persian Gulf            Some Arab governments refer to it as the  Arabian Gulf   Arabic                              romanized  Al Khal j al  Arab   or  The Gulf      The name  Gulf of Iran  Persian Gulf   is used by the International Hydrographic Organization     The Persian Gulf was a battlefield of the           Iran Iraq War  in which each side attacked the other s oil tankers  It is the namesake of the      Gulf War  the largely air  and land based conflict that followed Iraq s invasion of Kuwait  The Persian Gulf has many fishing grounds  extensive reefs  mostly rocky  but also coral   and abundant pearl oysters  but its ecology has been damaged by industrialization and oil spills  The Persian Gulf is in the Persian Gulf Basin  which is of Cenozoic origin and related to the subduction of the Arabian Plate under the Zagros Mountains     The current flooding of the basin started        years ago due to rising sea levels of the Holocene glacial retreat      Contents    Geography   Extent   Exclusive economic zone   Coastline length

the Persian Gulf  the inputs are river discharges from Iran and Iraq  estimated to be       cubic metres         cu ft  per second   as well as precipitation over the sea which is around     mm      in  year in Qeshm Island  The evaporation of the sea is high  so that after considering river discharge and rain contributions  there is still a deficit of     cubic kilometres      cu mi  per year      This difference is supplied by currents at the Strait of Hormuz  The water from the Persian Gulf has a higher salinity  and therefore exits from the bottom of the Strait  while ocean water with less salinity flows in through the top  Another study revealed the following numbers for water exchanges for the Persian Gulf  evaporation         m      ft  year  precipitation        m       ft  year

Persian Gulf  The Gulf of Oman leads to the Arabian Sea  Detail from larger map of the Middle East  In     BC  the Achaemenid Empire established the first ancient empire in Persis  Pars  or modern Fars   in the southwestern region of the Iranian plateau      Consequently  in the Greek sources  the body of water that bordered this province came to be known as the  Persian Gulf       During the years     to     BC  coinciding with the sovereignty of the Achaemenid Persian Empire over the Middle East area  especially the whole part of the Persian Gulf and some parts of the Arabian Peninsula  the name of  Pars Sea  is widely found in the compiled written texts     In the travel account of Pythagoras  several chapters are related to description of his travels accompanied by the Achaemenid king Darius the Great  to Susa and Persepolis  and the area is described  From among the writings of others in the same period  there is the inscription and engraving of Darius the Great  installed at junction of waters of Red Sea and the Nile river and the Rome river  current Mediterranean  which belongs to the  th century BC where Darius the Great has named the Persian Gulf Water Channel   Pars Sea    Persian Sea       King Darius says       I ordered to dig this  Suez  canal from the river that is called Nile and flows in Egypt  to the sea that begins in Pars  Therefore  when this canal had been dug as I had ordered  ships went from Egypt through this canal to Pars  as I had intended   Darius I Considering the historical background of the name Persian Gulf  Sir Arnold Wilson mentions in a book published in      that  no water channel has been so significant as the Persian Gulf to the geologists  archaeologists  geographers  merchants  politicians  excursionists  and scholars whether in past or in present  This water channel which separates the Iran Plateau from the Arabia Plate  has enjoyed an Iranian Identity since at least      years ago          Before being given its present name  the Persian Gulf was called many different names  The classical Greek writers  like Herodotus  called it  the Red Sea   In Babylonian texts  it was known as  the sea above Akkad   citation

internationally known as the Persian Gulf after the land of Persia  Iran   has been disputed by some Arab countries since the     s      Rivalry between Iran and some Arab states  along with the emergence of pan Arabism and Arab nationalism  has seen the name Arabian Gulf become predominant in most Arab countries          Names beyond these two have also been applied to or proposed for this body of water   History Ancient history  Diorama of Paleolithic hunter gatherers at Qeshm Island  Picture depicting extent of early civilizations around the Persian Gulf  including Lackhmids  and Sassanids   Picture depicting the Achaemenid Persian empire in relation to the Persian Gulf   A painting depicting the British Expeditionary Force off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah in       Earliest evidence of human presence on Persian Gulf islands dates back to Middle Paleolithic and consist of stone tools discovered at Qeshm Island      The world s oldest known civilization  Sumer  developed along the Persian Gulf and southern Mesopotamia  The shallow basin that now underlies the Persian Gulf was an extensive region of river valley and wetlands during the transition between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the start of the Holocene  which  according to University of Birmingham archaeologist Jeffrey Rose  served as an environmental refuge for early humans during periodic hyperarid climate oscillations  laying the foundations for the legend of Dilmun      For most of the early history of the settlements in the Persian Gulf  the southern shores were ruled by a series of nomadic tribes  During the end of the fourth millennium BC  the southern part of the Persian Gulf was dominated by the Dilmun civilization  For a long time the most important settlement on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf was Gerrha  In the  nd century the Lakhum tribe  who lived in what is now Yemen  migrated north and founded the Lakhmid Kingdom along the southern coast  Occasional ancient battles took place along the Persian Gulf coastlines  between the Sassanid Persian empire and the Lakhmid Kingdom  the most prominent of which was the invasion led by Shapur II against the Lakhmids  leading to Lakhmids  defeat  and advancement into Arabia  along the southern shore lines      During the  th century the Sassanid Persian empire conquered the whole of the Persian Gulf  including southern and northern shores  Between     BC and     AD  the northern side was dominated by a succession of Persian empires including the Median  Achaemenid  Seleucid and Parthian empires  Under the leadership of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great  Darius I   Persian ships found their way to the Persian Gulf      Persian naval forces laid the foundation for a strong Persian maritime presence in Persian Gulf  that started with Darius I and existed until the arrival of the British East India Company  and the Royal Navy by mid   th century AD  Persians were not only stationed on islands of the Persian Gulf  but also had ships often of     to     capacity patrolling empire s various rivers including Shatt al Arab  Tigris  and the Nile in the west  as well as Sind waterway  in India      Dark Green   Allieds or under influence  Yellow   Main Factories    The Achaemenid high naval command had established major naval bases located along Shatt al Arab river  Bahrain  Oman  and Yemen  The Persian fleet would soon not only be used for peacekeeping purposes along the Shatt al Arab but would also open the door to trade with India via Persian Gulf          Following the fall of Achaemenid Empire  and after the fall of the Parthian Empire  the Sassanid empire ruled the northern half and at times the southern half of the Persian Gulf  The Persian Gulf  along with the Silk Road  were important trade routes in the Sassanid empire  Many of the trading ports of the Persian empires were located in or around Persian Gulf  Siraf  an ancient Sassanid port that was located on the northern shore of the Persian gulf  located in what is now the Iranian province of Bushehr  is an example of such commercial port  Siraf  was also significant in that it had a flourishing commercial trade with China by the  th century  having first established connection with the far east in     AD       Colonial era See also  Portuguese rule and British residency of the Persian Gulf Portuguese influence in the Persian Gulf lasted for     years      however  since the beginning of the   th century  Portuguese dominance     contended with the local powers and the Ottoman Empire  Following the arrival of the English and the Dutch  the Safavid Empire allied with the newcomers to contest Portuguese dominance of the seas in the   th century      The Portuguese Castle on Hormuz Island  Gaspar Correia   Lendas da  ndia   c        Portuguese expansion into the Indian Ocean in the early   th century following Vasco da Gama s voyages of exploration saw them battle the Ottomans up the coast of the Persian Gulf  In       a Portuguese force led by commander Antonio Correia invaded Bahrain to take control of the wealth created by its pearl industry  On April           Sh h Abb s  the Persian emperor of the Safavid Persian Empire  expelled the Portuguese from Bahrain      and that date is commemorated as National Persian Gulf day in Iran      With the support of the British fleet  in       Abb s took the island of Hormuz from the Portuguese  much of the trade was diverted to the town of Bandar  Abb s  which he had taken from the Portuguese in      and had named after himself  The Persian Gulf was therefore opened to a flourishing commerce with the Portuguese  Dutch  French  Spanish and the British merchants  who were granted particular privileges  The Ottoman Empire reasserted itself into Eastern Arabia in           Under military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman Vilayet of Baghdad  Midhat Pasha  the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted peacefully to Ottoman rule      The Ottomans were forced to withdraw from the area with the start of World War I and the need for troops in various other frontiers      In World War II  the Western Allies used Iran as a conduit to transport military and industrial supply to the USSR  through a pathway known historically as the  Persian Corridor   Britain utilized the Persian Gulf as the entry point for the supply chain in order to make use of the Trans Iranian Railway      The Persian Gulf therefore became a critical maritime path through which the Allies transported equipment to Soviet Union against the Nazi invasion     The piracy in the Persian Gulf was prevalent until the   th century  Many of the most notable historical instances of piracy were perpetrated by the Al Qasimi tribe  This led to the British mounting the Persian Gulf campaign of           The campaign led to the signing of the General Maritime Treaty of      between the British and the Sheikhs of what was then known as the  Pirate Coast   From      until       the British Empire maintained varying degrees of political control over some of the Persian Gulf states  including the United Arab Emirates  originally called the Trucial States      and at various times Bahrain  Kuwait  Oman  and Qatar through the British Residency of the Persian Gulf   Modern history  Operation Earnest Will  Tanker convoy No     under US Navy

some of the most magnificent marine fauna and flora  some of which are near extirpation or at serious environmental risk  From corals  to dugongs  Persian Gulf is a diverse cradle for many species who depend on each other for survival  However  the Persian Gulf is not as biologically diverse as the Red Sea      Overall  the wild life of the Persian Gulf is endangered from both global factors  and regional  local negligence  Most pollution is from ships  land generated pollution counts as the second most common source of pollution       Aquatic mammals This article contains weasel words  vague

Persian Gulf  the Red Sea  the Gulf of Kutch  the Gulf of Suez  the Gulf of Aqaba  the Gulf of Aden  and the Gulf of Oman  dolphins and finless porpoises are the most common marine mammals in the waters  while larger whales and orcas are rarer today      Historically  whales had been abundant in the Persian gulf before commercial hunts wiped them out          Whales were reduced even further by illegal mass hunts by the Soviet Union and Japan in the     s and     s      Along with Bryde s whales                  these once common residents can still can be seen in deeper marginal seas such as Gulf of Aden      Israel coasts      and in the Strait of Hormuz      Other species such as the critically endangered Arabian humpback whale       also historically common in Gulf of Aden     and increasingly sighted in the Red Sea since       including in the Gulf of Aqaba       omura s whale          minke whale  and orca also swim into the Persian gulf  while many other large species such as blue whale      sei      and sperm whales were once migrants into the Gulf of Oman and off the coasts in deeper waters      and still migrate into the Red Sea      but mainly in deeper waters of outer seas  In       waters of the Persian Gulf along Abu Dhabi were revealed to hold the world s largest population of Indo Pacific humpbacked dolphins              One of the more unusual marine mammals living in the Persian Gulf is the dugong  Dugong dugon   Also called  sea cows   for their grazing habits and mild manner resembling livestock  dugongs have a life expectancy similar to that of humans and they can grow up to   metres      feet  in length  These gentle mammals feed on sea grass and are closer relatives of certain land mammals than are dolphins and whales      Their simple grass diet is negatively affected by new developments along the Persian Gulf coastline  particularly the construction of artificial islands by Arab states and pollution from oil spills caused during the  Persian Gulf war  and various other natural and artificial causes  Uncontrolled hunting has also had a negative impact on the survival of dugongs      After Australian waters  which are estimated to contain some        dugong inhabitants  the waters off Qatar  Bahrain  UAE  and Saudi Arabia make the Persian Gulf the second most important habitat for the species  hosting some       remaining dugongs  However  the current number of dugongs is dwindling and it is not clear how many are currently alive or what their reproductive trend is          Unfortunately  ambitious and uncalculated construction schemes  political unrest  ever present international conflict  the most lucrative world supply of oil  and the lack of cooperation between Arab states and Iran  have had a negative impact on the survival of many marine species  including dugongs   Birds The Persian Gulf is also home to many migratory and local birds  There is great variation in color  size  and type of the bird species that call the Persian gulf home  Concerns regarding the endangerment of the kalbaensis subspecies of the collared kingfishers were raised by conservationists due to real state development by the United Arab Emirates and Oman      Estimates from      showed that only three viable nesting sites were available for this ancient bird  one located    miles      km  from Dubai  and two smaller sites in Oman      Such real estate expansion could prove devastating to this subspecies  A UN plan to protect the mangroves as a biological reserve was ignored by the emirate of Sharjah  which allowed the dredging of a channel that bisects the wetland and construction of an adjacent concrete walkway      Environmental watchdogs in Arabia are few  and those that do advocate the wildlife are often silenced or ignored by developers of real estate many of whom have governmental connections      Real estate development in the Persian Gulf by the United Arab Emirates and Oman also raised concerns that habitats of species such as the hawksbill turtle  greater flamingo  and booted warbler may be destroyed          The dolphins that frequent the Persian gulf in northern waters around Iran are also at risk  Recent statistics and observations show that dolphins are at danger of entrapment in purse seine fishing nets and exposure to chemical pollutants  perhaps the most alarming sign is the  mass suicides  committed by dolphins off Iran s Hormozgan province  which are not well understood  but are suspected to be linked with a deteriorating marine environment from water pollution from oil  sewage  and industrial run offs           Fish and reefs The Persian Gulf is home to over     species of fish  most of which are native      Of these     species  more than     are reef associated      These reefs are primarily rocky  but there are also a few coral reefs  Compared to the Red Sea  the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf are relatively few and far between              This is primarily connected to the influx of major rivers  especially the Shatt al Arab  Euphrates and Tigris   which carry large amounts of sediment  most reef building corals require strong light  and causes relatively large variations in temperature and salinity  corals in general are poorly suited to large variations               Nevertheless  coral reefs have been found along sections of coast of all countries in the Persian gulf      Corals are vital ecosystems that support multitude of marine species  and whose health directly reflects the health of the Persian gulf  Recent years have seen a drastic decline in the coral population in the Persian gulf  partially owing to global warming but majorly due to irresponsible dumping by Arab states like the UAE and Bahrain      Construction garbage such as tires  cement  and chemical by products have found their way to the Persian Gulf in recent years  Aside from direct damage to the coral  the construction waste creates  traps  for marine life in which they are trapped and die      The end result has been a dwindling population of the coral  and as a result a decrease in number of species that rely on the corals for their survival   Flora A great example of this symbiosis are the mangroves in the Persian gulf  which require tidal flow and a combination of fresh and salt water for growth  and act as nurseries for many crabs  small fish  and insects  these fish and insects are the source of food for many of the marine birds that feed on them      Mangroves are a diverse group of shrubs and trees belonging to the genus Avicennia or Rhizophora that flourish in the salt water shallows of the Persian gulf  and are the most important habitats for small crustaceans that dwell in them  They are as crucial an indicator of biological health on the surface of the water  as the corals are to biological health of the Persian gulf in deeper waters  Mangroves  ability to survive the salt water through intricate molecular mechanisms  their unique reproductive cycle  and their ability to grow in the most oxygen deprived waters have allowed them extensive growth in hostile areas of the Persian gulf          However  with the advent of artificial island development  most of their habitat is destroyed  or occupied by man made structures  This has had a negative impact on the crustaceans that rely on the mangrove  and in turn on the species that feed on them   Gallery     Dugong mother and her offspring in shallow water       Indo Pacific bottlenose dolphins off the southern shore of Iran  around
