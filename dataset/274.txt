       Royal Road  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search For other uses  see Royal Road  disambiguation  Not to be confused with Royal Roads   The map of Achaemenid Empire and the section of the Royal Road noted by Herodotus The Royal Road was an ancient highway reorganized and rebuilt by the Persian king Darius the Great  Darius I  of the first  Achaemenid  Persian Empire in the  th century BCE     Darius built the road to facilitate rapid communication throughout his very large empire from Susa to Sardis      Mounted couriers of the Angarium were supposed to travel       miles        km  from Susa to Sardis in nine days  the journey took ninety days on foot      Contents    Course of the Royal Road   History of the Royal Road   Legacy      A metaphorical  Royal Road  in famous quotations     See also   Notes   References   Course of the Royal Road edit  The course of the road has been reconstructed from the writings of Herodotus     archeological research  and other historical records  It began in Sardis near the Aegean coast of Lydia  traveled east through Anatolia  crossing the Halys according to Herodotus   and passed through the Cilician Gates to the old Assyrian capital Nineveh in upper Mesopotamia  then turned south to Babylon  From near Babylon  it is believed to have split into two routes  one traveling northeast then east through Ecbatana and on along the Silk Road  via the Great Khurasan Road   the other continuing east through the future Persian capital Susa and then southeast to Persepolis in the Zagros Mountains  Of course  such long routes for travellers and tradesmen would often take months on end  and during the reign of Darius the Great numerous royal outposts  Caravanserai  were built   History of the Royal Road edit  Because the road did not follow the shortest nor the easiest route between the most important cities of the Persian Empire  archeologists believe the westernmost sections of the road may have originally been built by the Assyrian kings  as the road plunges through the heart of their old empire  More eastern segments of the road  identifiable in present day northern Iran  were not noted by Herodotus  whose view of Persia was that of an Ionian Greek in the West     stretches of the Royal Road across the central plateau of Iran are coincident with the major trade route known as the Silk Road  This route was used by couriers to deliver messages to the Persian capital  However  Darius I improved the existing road network into the Royal Road as it is recognized today   A later improvement by the Romans of a road bed with a hard packed gravelled surface of      m width held within a stone curbing was found in a stretch near Gordium    and connecting the parts together in a unified whole stretching some      miles  primarily as a post road  with a hundred and eleven posting stations maintained with a supply of fresh horses  a quick mode of communication using relays of swift mounted messengers  the kingdom s pirradazis  The construction of the road as improved by Darius was of such quality that the road continued to be used until Roman times  A bridge at Diyarbak r  Turkey  still stands from this period of the road s use  The road also helped Persia increase long distance trade  which reached its peak during the time of Alexander the Great  Alexander III of Macedon   In       under a grant from the American Philosophical Society  S  F  Starr traced the stretch of road from Gordium to Sardis  identifying river crossings by ancient bridge abutments     It was maintained by personal guards  clarification needed  The road also was made secure by the Persians  Guard posts were stationed along the road  patrols were also made to secure the route  The Royal Road would be a monument of the Persian Empire   Legacy edit  The Greek historian Herodotus wrote   There is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers   Herodotus s praise for these messengers  Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds   was inscribed on the James Farley Post Office in New York and is sometimes thought of as the United States Postal Service creed   A metaphorical  Royal Road  in famous quotations edit  Euclid is said to have replied to King Ptolemy s request for an easier way of learning mathematics that  there is no Royal Road to geometry   according to Proclus     Charles Sanders Peirce  in his How to Make Our Ideas Clear         says   There is no royal road to logic  and really valuable ideas can only be had at the price of close attention   This essay was claimed by William James as instrumental in the foundation of the philosophical school of pragmatism  Sigmund Freud famously described dreams as the  royal road to the unconscious    Via regia zur Kenntnis des Unbewu ten    Karl Marx wrote in the      Preface to the French Edition of Das Kapital  Volume      There is no royal road to science  and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits   The Royal

suggested that Herodotus was partly in error in his tracing the route through Anatolia by making it cross the Halys and showed that though his overall his distances in parasangs are approximately correct  his distances over the sections he describes bear no relation to geographical facts      Herodotus  a Greek from the Aegean coast of Asia Minor  appears to have reported only that part of the network which led directly to the parts of the Greek world that concerned him   notes Young  Rodney S           Gordion on the Royal Road   Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society
