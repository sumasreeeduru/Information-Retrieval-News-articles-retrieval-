parts in the American journal The Little Review from March      to December      and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on   February       Joyce s   th birthday  It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature    and has been called  a demonstration and summation of the entire movement      According to Declan Kiberd   Before Joyce  no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking      Ulysses chronicles the appointments and encounters of the itinerant Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day     June             Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus  the hero of Homer s epic poem the Odyssey  and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel  with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Bloom and Odysseus  Molly Bloom and Penelope  and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus  in addition to events and themes of the early   th century context of modernism  Dublin  and Ireland s relationship to Britain  The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature  Since its publication  the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny  ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in      to protracted textual  Joyce Wars   The novel s stream of consciousness technique  careful structuring  and experimental prose replete with puns  parodies  and allusions as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history

Electronic versions     Background edit  Joyce first encountered the figure of Odysseus Ulysses in Charles Lamb s Adventures of Ulysses  an adaptation of the Odyssey for children  which seems to have established the Latin name in Joyce s mind  At school he wrote an essay on the character  titled  My Favourite Hero         Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all round character in literature     He thought about calling his short story collection Dubliners Ulysses in Dublin     but the idea grew from a story written in       to a  short book  in           to the vast novel he began in        Locations edit   Ulysses Dublin map     Leopold Bloom s home at   Eccles Street       Episode    Calypso  Episode     Ithaca  and Episode     Penelope Post office

Gabler s edition  In the various editions the breaks between episodes are indicated in different ways  e g   in the Modern Language edition each episode begins at the top of a new page  At first glance  much of the book may appear unstructured and chaotic  Joyce once said that he had  put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant   which would earn the novel immortality      The schemata Stuart Gilbert and Herbert Gorman released after publication to help defend Joyce from obscenity accusations clarification needed  made

Odyssey       Homer s Odyssey is divided into    books  sections   Scholars have suggested that every episode of Ulysses has a theme  technique and correspondence between its characters and those of the Odyssey  The text of the novel does not include the episode titles used below  nor the correspondences  which originate from explanatory outlines Joyce sent to friends  known as the Linati and Gilbert schemata  Joyce referred to the episodes by their Homeric titles in his letters  He took the idiosyncratic rendering of some of the titles  e g    Nausikaa  and the  Telemachiad   from Victor

James Joyce Tower and Museum It is   a m  Buck Mulligan  a boisterous medical student  calls Stephen Dedalus  a young writer encountered as the principal subject of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man  up to the roof of the Sandycove Martello tower  where they both live  There is tension between Stephen and Mulligan  stemming from a cruel remark Stephen overheard Mulligan make about his recently deceased mother  May Dedalus  and from the fact that Mulligan has invited an English student  Haines  to stay with them  The three men eat breakfast and walk to the shore  where Mulligan demands from Stephen the key to the tower and a loan  Departing  Stephen declares that he will not return to the tower that night  as Mulligan  the  usurper   has taken it over   Episode    Nestor edit  Stephen is teaching a history class on the victories of Pyrrhus of Epirus  After class  one student  Cyril Sargent  stays behind so that Stephen can show him how to do a set of algebraic exercises  Stephen looks at Sargent s ugly face and tries to imagine Sargent s mother s love for him  He then visits school headmaster Garrett Deasy  from whom he collects his pay and a letter to take to a newspaper office for printing  The two discuss Irish history and Deasy lectures on what he believes is the role of Jews in the economy  As Stephen leaves  Deasy said that Ireland has  never persecuted the Jews  because the country  never let them in   This episode is the source of some of the novel s most famous lines  such as Dedalus s claim that  history is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake  and that God is  a shout in the street    Episode    Proteus edit   Sandymount Strand looking across Dublin Bay to Howth Head Stephen finds his way to Sandymount Strand and mopes around for some time  mulling various philosophical concepts  his family  his life as a student in Paris  and his mother s death  As he reminisces and ponders  he lies down among some rocks  watches a couple whose dog urinates behind a rock  scribbles some ideas for poetry and picks his nose  This chapter is characterised by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly  Stephen s education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode  which have earned it a reputation for being one of the book s most difficult chapters   Part II  Odyssey edit  Episode    Calypso edit  The narrative shifts abruptly  The time is again   a m   but the action has moved across the city and to the second protagonist of the book  Leopold Bloom  a part Jewish advertising canvasser  The episode opens with the famous line  Mr  Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls   Bloom  after starting to prepare breakfast  decides to walk to a butcher to buy a pork kidney  Returning home  he prepares breakfast and brings it with the mail to his wife Molly as she lounges in bed   One of the letters is from her concert manager Blazes Boylan  with whom Molly is having an affair  Bloom is aware that Molly will welcome Boylan into her bed later that day  and is tormented by the thought  Bloom reads a letter from their daughter Milly Bloom  who tells him about her progress in the photography business in Mullingar  The episode closes with Bloom reading a magazine story titled Matcham s Masterstroke  by Mr  Philip Beaufoy  while defecating in the outhouse   Episode    Lotus Eaters edit   Several Dublin businesses note that they were mentioned in Ulysses  like this undertakers  Bloom makes his way to Westland Row post office  where he receives a love letter from one  Martha Clifford  addressed to his pseudonym   Henry Flower   He meets an acquaintance  and while they chat  Bloom attempts to ogle a woman wearing stockings  but is prevented by a passing tram  Next  he reads the letter and tears up the envelope in an alley  He wanders into a Catholic church service and muses on theology  The priest has the letters I N R I  or I H S  on his back  Molly had told Bloom that they meant I have sinned or I have suffered  and Iron nails ran in      He goes to a chemist where he buys a bar of lemon soap  He then meets another acquaintance  Bantam Lyons  who mistakenly takes him to be offering a racing tip for the horse Throwaway  Finally  Bloom heads towards the baths   Episode    Hades edit  The episode begins with Bloom entering a funeral carriage with three others  including Stephen s father  They drive to Paddy Dignam s funeral  making small talk on the way  The carriage passes both Stephen and Blazes Boylan  There is discussion of various forms of death and burial  and Bloom is preoccupied by thoughts of his dead son  Rudy  and the suicide of his own father  They enter the chapel into the service and subsequently leave with the coffin cart  Bloom sees a mysterious man wearing a mackintosh during the burial  Bloom continues to reflect upon death  but at the end of the episode rejects morbid thoughts to embrace  warm fullblooded life    Episode    Aeolus edit  At the office of the Freeman s Journal  Bloom attempts to place an ad  Although initially encouraged by the editor  he is unsuccessful  Stephen arrives bringing Deasy s letter about  foot and mouth  disease  but Stephen and Bloom do not meet  Stephen leads the editor and others to a pub  relating an anecdote on the way about  two Dublin vestals   The episode is broken into short segments by newspaper style headlines  and is characterised by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices   Episode    Lestrygonians edit   Davy Byrne s Pub  Dublin  where Bloom consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy Bloom s thoughts are peppered with references to food as lunchtime approaches  He meets an old flame  hears news of Mina Purefoy s labour  and helps a blind boy cross the street  He enters the restaurant of the Burton Hotel  where he is revolted by the sight of men eating like animals  He goes instead to Davy Byrne s pub  where he consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy  and muses upon the early days of his relationship with Molly and how the marriage has declined   Me  And me now   Bloom s thoughts touch on what goddesses and gods eat and drink  He ponders whether the statues of Greek goddesses in the National Museum have anuses as do mortals  On leaving the pub Bloom heads toward the museum  but spots Boylan across the street and  panicking  rushes into the gallery across the street from the museum   Episode    Scylla and Charybdis edit   National Library of Ireland At the National Library  Stephen explains to some scholars his biographical theory of the works of Shakespeare  especially Hamlet  which he argues are based largely on the posited adultery of Shakespeare s wife   Bloom enters the National Library to look up an old copy of the ad he has been trying to place  He encounters Stephen briefly and unknowingly at the end of the episode   Episode     Wandering Rocks edit  In this episode  nineteen short vignettes depict the wanderings of various characters  major and minor  through the streets of Dublin  Included among these is a brief scene between Mulligan and Haines at a coffeehouse patronized by the chess playing brother of Irish hero Charles Stewart Parnell  in which Haines and Mulligan discuss Stephen s predicament  The scene is a type of ekphrasis in that Mulligan s pronouncements  that the Catholic education system  drove  Stephen s  wits astray  and that Stephen  will never capture the Attic note   point to a central tension in the novel between contemplation and action  a tension best summarized elsewhere in Matthew Arnold s essay Hebraism and Hellenism  which Joyce read and enjoyed  The episode ends with an account of the cavalcade of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  William Ward  Earl of Dudley  through the streets  which is encountered by various characters from the novel   Episode     Sirens edit  In this episode  dominated by motifs of music  Bloom has dinner with Stephen s uncle at a hotel  while Molly s lover  Blazes Boylan  proceeds to his rendezvous with her  While dining  Bloom watches the seductive barmaids and listens to the singing of Stephen s father and others   Episode     Cyclops edit  This chapter is narrated by an unnamed denizen of Dublin  The narrator goes to Barney Kiernan s pub where he meets a character referred to only as  The Citizen   There is a belief that this character is a satirization of Michael Cusack  a founder member of the Gaelic Athletic Association      When Leopold Bloom enters the pub  he is berated by the Citizen  who is a fierce Fenian and anti Semite   The episode ends with Bloom reminding the Citizen that his Saviour was a Jew  As Bloom leaves the pub  the Citizen  in anger  throws a biscuit tin at Bloom s head  but misses  The chapter is marked by extended tangents made in voices other than that of the unnamed narrator  these include streams of legal jargon  Biblical passages  and elements of Irish mythology   Episode     Nausicaa edit  All the action of the episode takes place on the rocks of Sandymount Strand  a shoreline area to the southeast of central Dublin      A young woman named Gerty MacDowell is seated on the rocks with her two friends  Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman  The girls are taking care of three children  a baby  and four year old twins named Tommy and Jacky  Gerty contemplates love  marriage and femininity as night falls  The reader is gradually made aware that Bloom is watching her from a distance  Gerty teases the onlooker by exposing her legs and underwear  and Bloom  in turn  masturbates  Bloom s masturbatory climax is echoed by the fireworks at the nearby bazaar  As Gerty leaves  Bloom realises that she has a lame leg  and believes this is the reason she has been  left on the shelf   After several mental digressions he decides to visit Mina Purefoy at the maternity hospital  It is uncertain how much of the episode is Gerty s thoughts  and how much is Bloom s sexual fantasy  Some believe that the episode is divided into two halves  the first half the highly romanticized viewpoint of Gerty  and the other half that of the older and more realistic Bloom      Joyce himself said  however  that  nothing happened between  Gerty and Bloom   It all took place in Bloom s imagination        Nausicaa  attracted immense notoriety while the book was being published in serial form  It has also attracted great attention from scholars of disability in literature      The style of the first half of the episode borrows from  and parodies  romance magazines and novelettes   Episode     Oxen of the Sun edit  Bloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth  and finally meets Stephen  who has been drinking with his medical student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan  As the only father in the group of men  Bloom is concerned about Mina Purefoy in her labour  He starts thinking about his wife and the births of his two children  He also thinks about the loss of his only  heir   Rudy  The young men become boisterous  and even start talking about topics such as fertility  contraception and abortion  There is also a suggestion that Milly  Bloom s daughter  is in a relationship with one of the young men  Bannon  They continue on to a pub to continue drinking  following the successful birth of a son to Mina Purefoy  This chapter is remarkable for Joyce s wordplay  which  among other things  recapitulates the entire history of the English language  After a short incantation  the episode starts with latinate prose  Anglo Saxon alliteration  and moves on through parodies of  among others  Malory  the King James Bible  Bunyan  Pepys   Defoe  Sterne  Walpole  Gibbon  Dickens  and Carlyle  before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang  The development of the English language in the episode is believed to be aligned with the nine month gestation period of the foetus in the womb       Episode     Circe edit  Episode    is written as a play script  complete with stage directions  The plot is frequently interrupted by  hallucinations  experienced by Stephen and Bloom fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters  Stephen and Lynch walk into Nighttown  Dublin s red light district  Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them at Bella Cohen s brothel where  in the company of her workers including Zoe Higgins  Florry Talbot and Kitty Ricketts  he has a series of hallucinations regarding his sexual fetishes  fantasies and transgressions  Bloom is put in the dock to answer charges by a variety of sadistic  accusing women including Mrs Yelverton Barry  Mrs Bellingham and the Hon Mrs Mervyn Talboys  When Bloom witnesses Stephen overpaying for services received  Bloom decides to hold onto the rest of Stephen s money for safekeeping   Stephen hallucinates that the rotting cadaver of his mother has risen up from the floor to confront him  Terrified  Stephen uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier and then runs out  Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage  then runs after Stephen  Bloom finds Stephen engaged in a heated argument with an English soldier  Private Carr  who  after a perceived insult to the King  punches Stephen  The police arrive and the crowd disperses   As Bloom is tending to Stephen  Bloom has a hallucination of Rudy  his deceased child   Part III  Nostos edit  Episode     Eumaeus edit  Bloom and Stephen go to the cabman s shelter to restore the latter to his senses   At the cabman s shelter  they encounter a drunken sailor named D  B  Murphy  W  B  Murphy in the      text   The episode is dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity  with Bloom  Stephen and Murphy s identities being repeatedly called into question  The rambling and laboured style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists   Episode     Ithaca edit  Bloom returns home with Stephen  makes him a cup of cocoa  discusses cultural and lingual differences between them  considers the possibility of publishing Stephen s parable stories  and offers him a place to stay for the night  Stephen refuses Bloom s offer and is ambiguous in response to Bloom s proposal of future meetings  The two men urinate in the backyard  Stephen departs and wanders off into the night      and Bloom goes to bed  where Molly is sleeping  She awakens and questions him about his day  The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organised and  mathematical  catechism of     questions and answers  and was reportedly Joyce s favourite episode in the novel   The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination and include a famous list of    men perceived as Molly s lovers  apparently corresponding to the suitors slain at Ithaca by Odysseus and Telemachus in The Odyssey   including Boylan  and Bloom s psychological reaction to their assignation  While describing events apparently chosen randomly in ostensibly precise mathematical or scientific terms  the episode is rife with errors made by the undefined narrator  many or most of which are intentional by Joyce       Episode     Penelope edit  The final episode consists of Molly Bloom s thoughts as she lies in bed next to her husband   The episode uses a stream of consciousness technique in eight paragraphs and lacks punctuation   Molly thinks about Boylan and Bloom  her past admirers  including Lieutenant Stanley G  Gardner  the events of the day  her childhood in Gibraltar  and her curtailed singing career  She also hints at a lesbian relationship  in her youth  with a childhood friend named Hester Stanhope  These thoughts are occasionally interrupted by distractions  such as a train whistle or the need to urinate   The episode famously concludes with Molly s remembrance of Bloom s marriage proposal  and of her acceptance   he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes    The episode is also concerned with the occurrence of Molly s early menstrual period  She considers the proximity of her period following her extra marital affairs with Boylan  and believes her menstrual condition is the reason for her increased sexual appetite  Molly corresponds to Penelope in Homer s epic poem  who is known for her fidelity to Odysseus during his twenty year absence  despite having many suitors   Editions edit  Publication history edit   Memorial plaque  at    Rue de l Od on  Paris  the original location of Shakespeare   Co     In      Sylvia Beach published James Joyce s Ulysses in this house   The publication history of Ulysses is complex  There have been at least    editions  and variations in different impressions of each edition  According to Joyce scholar Jack Dalton  the first edition of Ulysses contained over two thousand errors but was still the most accurate edition published      As each subsequent edition attempted to correct these mistakes  it incorporated more of its own  a task made more difficult by deliberate errors  See  Episode     Ithaca  above  devised by Joyce to challenge the reader      Notable editions include   the first edition published in Paris on   February       Joyce s   th birthday  by Sylvia Beach at Shakespeare and Company       numbered copies printed by Darantiere in Dijon consisting of     signed copies on Dutch handmade paper      numbered copies on  verg  d Arches paper  and     copies on handmade paper      plus an extra    unnumbered copies on mixed paper for libraries and press              the first English edition published by Harriet Shaw Weaver s Egoist Press  London  in October       For legal reasons the book was printed on behalf of Egoist Press by John Rodker  Paris  using the same printer  Darantiere  and plates as the first Paris edition  This edition consisted of      numbered copies on handmade paper for sale     plus     unnumbered copies for press  publicity and legal deposit libraries                  A seven page errata list compiled by Joyce  Weaver and Rodker was loosely inserted and contained     corrections          Approximately     copies were burned by the New York Post Office Authorities     as noted in later Shakespeare   Co  editions      the pirated Samuel Roth edition  published in New York in       The first U S  edition of the novel  unauthorised by Joyce  was designed to closely mimic the      Shakespeare   Company  th printing but many errors and corruptions occurred during reproduction          Reportedly           copies were printed but the majority were seized and destroyed by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice after a raid on his offices on   October           A copy of this edition was unknowingly used by Bennett Cerf of Random House as the basis for the first authorised US edition printed in       reproducing many of these errors          the Odyssey Press  Hamburg  edition of       issued in two volumes  The title page of this edition states  The present edition may be regarded as the definitive standard edition  as it has been specially revised  at the author s request  by Stuart Gilbert    This edition still contained errors but by its fourth revised printing  April       it was considered the most accurate offering of the text and subsequently used as the basis for many publications of Ulysses              the      Random House first authorised U S  edition      published after the decision in United States v  One Book Called Ulysses finding that the book was not obscene  discussed below in  Censorship        the first edition printed and published in England  The Bodley Head in           the revised Bodley Head edition of      the revised Modern Library edition of       reset from the Bodley Head      edition  the Gabler critical and synoptic edition of       Gabler s  corrected edition  edit  Hans Walter Gabler s      edition was the most sustained attempt to produce a corrected text  but it received much criticism  most notably from John Kidd  Kidd s main theoretical criticism is of Gabler s choice of a patchwork of manuscripts as his copy text  the base edition with which the editor compares each variant   but this fault stems from an assumption of the Anglo American tradition of scholarly editing rather than the blend of French and German editorial theories that actually lay behind Gabler s reasoning      The choice of a composite copy text is seen to be problematic in the eyes of some American editors  who generally favour the first edition of any particular work as copy text      Less subject to differing national editorial theories  however  is the claim that for hundreds of pages about half the episodes of Ulysses the extant manuscript is purported to be a  fair copy  that Joyce made for sale to a potential patron   As it turned out  John Quinn  the Irish American lawyer and collector  purchased the manuscript   Diluting this charge somewhat is the fact that the theory of  now lost  final working drafts is Gabler s own  For the suspect episodes  the existing typescript is the last witness  Gabler attempted to reconstruct what he called  the continuous manuscript text   which had never physically existed  by adding together all of Joyce s accretions from the various sources  This allowed Gabler to produce a  synoptic text  indicating the stage at which each addition was inserted  Kidd and even some of Gabler s own advisers believe this method meant losing Joyce s final changes in about two thousand places      Far from being  continuous   the manuscripts seem to be opposite  Jerome McGann describes in detail the editorial principles of Gabler in his article for the journal Criticism  issue               In the wake of the controversy  still other commentators charged that Gabler s changes were motivated by a desire to secure a fresh copyright and another seventy five years of royalties beyond a looming expiration date  In June      John Kidd published  The Scandal of Ulysses  in The New York Review of Books      charging that not only did Gabler s changes overturn Joyce s last revisions  but in another four hundred places Gabler failed to follow any manuscript whatever  making nonsense of his own premises  Kidd accused Gabler of unnecessarily changing Joyce s spelling  punctuation  use of accents  and all the small details he claimed to have been restoring  Instead  Gabler was actually following printed editions such as that of       not the manuscripts  More sensationally  Gabler was found to have made genuine blunders  the most famous being his changing the name of the real life Dubliner Harry Thrift to  Shrift  and cricketer Captain Buller to  Culler  on the basis of handwriting irregularities in the extant manuscript   These  corrections  were undone by Gabler in         Kidd stated that many of Gabler s errors resulted from Gabler s use of facsimiles rather than original manuscripts  In December       Charles Rossman s  The New Ulysses  The Hidden Controversy  for the New York Review revealed that Gabler s own advisers felt too many changes were being made  but that the publishers were pushing for as many alterations as possible  Then Kidd produced a     page critique that filled an entire issue of the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America  dated the same month  This  Inquiry into Ulysses  The Corrected Text  was the next year published in book format and on floppy disk by Kidd s James Joyce Research Center at Boston University  Gabler and others rejected Kidd s critique  and the scholarly community remains divided   Gabler edition dropped  publishers revert to         editions edit  In       Gabler s American publisher Random House  after consulting a committee of scholars      replaced the Gabler edition with its      version  and in the United Kingdom the Bodley Head press revived its      version  In both the UK and US  Everyman s Library also republished the      Ulysses  In       Penguin dropped Gabler and reprinted the      text  The Gabler version remained available from Vintage International  Reprints of the      first edition have also become widely available since   January       when this edition entered the public domain under U S  copyright law      While much ink has been spilt over the faults and theoretical underpinnings of the Gabler edition  the long awaited Kidd edition has yet to be published  as of      update   In      W  W  Norton announced that a Kidd edition of Ulysses was to be published as part of a series called  The Dublin Edition of the Works of James Joyce   This book had to be withdrawn when the Joyce estate objected  The estate refused to authorise any further editions of Joyce s work for the immediate future  but signed a deal with Wordsworth Editions to bring out a bargain version of the novel in January       ahead of copyright expiration in                Censorship edit  Written over a seven year period from      to       the novel was serialised in the American journal The Little Review from      to           when the publication of the Nausica  episode led to a prosecution for obscenity under the Comstock Act of       which made it illegal to circulate materials deemed obscene in the U S  mail      In       sections of the novel also appeared in the London literary journal The Egoist  but the novel itself was banned in the United Kingdom until           Joyce had resolved that the book would be published on his   th birthday    February       and Sylvia Beach  Joyce s publisher in Paris  received the first three copies from the printer that morning          The      prosecution in the US was brought after The Little Review serialised a passage of the book dealing with characters masturbating  Three earlier chapters had been banned by the US Post Office  but it was John S  Sumner  Secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice  who had instigated this legal action      The Post Office did partially suppress the  Nausica   edition of The Little Review      Legal historian Edward de Grazia has argued that few readers would have been fully aware of the orgasmic experience in the text  given the metaphoric language      Irene Gammel extends this argument to suggest that the obscenity allegations brought against The Little Review were influenced by the Baroness Elsa von Freytag Loringhoven s more explicit poetry  which had appeared alongside the serialization of Ulysses      At the trial in      the magazine was declared obscene and  as a result  Ulysses was effectively banned in the United States  Throughout the     s  the United States Post Office Department burned copies of the novel      In       the publisher Random House and lawyer Morris Ernst arranged to import the French edition and have a copy seized by Customs   The publisher contested the seizure  and in United States v  One Book Called Ulysses  U S  District Judge John M  Woolsey ruled that the book was not pornographic and therefore could not be obscene      a decision that was called  epoch making  by Stuart Gilbert      The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling in            The US therefore became the first English speaking country where the book was freely available  Although Ulysses was never banned in Ireland by the Censorship of Publications Board  the government used a customs loophole which prevented it from being allowed into Ireland              It was first openly available in Ireland in the     s       Literary significance and critical reception edit  In a review in The Dial  T  S  Eliot said of Ulysses    I hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found  it is a book to which we are all indebted  and from which none of us can escape   He went on to assert that Joyce was not at fault if people after him did not understand it    The next generation is responsible for its own soul  a man of genius is responsible to his peers  not to a studio full of uneducated and undisciplined coxcombs          What is so staggering about Ulysses is the fact that behind a thousand veils nothing lies hidden  that it turns neither toward the mind nor toward the world  but  as cold as the moon looking on from cosmic space  allows the drama of growth  being  and decay to pursue its course     Carl Jung      Ulysses has been called  the most prominent landmark in modernist literature   a work where life s complexities are depicted with  unprecedented  and unequalled  linguistic and stylistic virtuosity       That style has been stated to be the finest example of the use of stream of consciousness in modern fiction  with the author going deeper and farther than any other novelist in handling interior monologue and stream of consciousness       This technique has been praised for its faithful representation of the flow of thought  feeling  and mental reflection  as well as shifts of mood      Literary critic Edmund Wilson noted that Ulysses attempts to render  as precisely and as directly as it is possible in words to do  what our participation in life is like or rather  what it seems to us like as from moment to moment we live       Stuart Gilbert said that the  personages of Ulysses are not fictitious       but that  these people are as they must be  they act  we see  according to some lex eterna  an ineluctable condition of their very existence       Through these characters Joyce  achieves a coherent and integral interpretation of life       Joyce uses  metaphors  symbols  ambiguities  and overtones which gradually link themselves together so as to form a network of connections binding the whole  work       This system of connections gives the novel a wide  more universal significance  as  Leopold Bloom becomes a modern Ulysses  an Everyman in a Dublin which becomes a microcosm of the world        Eliot described this system as the  mythic method    a way of controlling  of ordering  of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history        Novelist Vladimir Nabokov called Ulysses a  divine work of art  and the greatest masterpiece of   th century prose      and said that  it towers above the rest of Joyce s writing  with  noble originality  unique lucidity of thought and style       The book did have its critics  largely in response to its then uncommon inclusion of sexual elements  Shane Leslie described Ulysses as  literary Bolshevism     experimental  anti conventional  anti Christian  chaotic  totally unmoral       Karl Radek called Ulysses  a heap of dung  crawling with worms  photographed by a cinema camera through a microscope       Virginia Woolf stated   Ulysses was a memorable catastrophe immense in daring  terrific in disaster       One newspaper pundit stated it contained  secret sewers of vice     canalized in its flood of unimaginable thoughts  images  and pornographic words  and  revolting blasphemies  which  debases and perverts and degrades the noble gift of imagination and wit and lordship of language        Media adaptations edit  Theatre edit  Ulysses in
