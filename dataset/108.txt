Main article  Fourth UK television service Before Channel   and S C  Britain had three terrestrial television services  BBC   BBC   and ITV  The Broadcasting Act      began the process of adding a fourth  Channel   was formally created  along with its Welsh counterpart  by an Act of Parliament in       After some months of test broadcasts  it began scheduled transmissions on   November       The notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in      and its subsequent launch in       the idea of an  ITV   was long expected and pushed for  Indeed  television sets sold throughout the     s and early     s had a spare tuning button labelled  ITV IBA     Throughout ITV s history and until Channel   finally became a reality  a perennial dialogue existed between the GPO  the government  the ITV companies and other interested parties  concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take  Most likely  politics had the biggest impact in leading to a delay of almost three decades before the second commercial channel became a reality     One clear benefit of the  late arrival  of the channel was that its frequency allocations at each transmitter had already been arranged in the early     s  when the launch of an ITV  was highly anticipated     This led to very good coverage across most of the country and few problems of interference with other UK based transmissions  a stark contrast to the problems associated with Channel   s launch almost    years later      Wales Main article  S C At the time the fourth service was being considered  a movement in Wales lobbied for the creation of dedicated service that would air Welsh language programmes  then only catered for at  off peak  times on BBC Wales and HTV  The campaign was taken so seriously by Gwynfor Evans  former president of Plaid Cymru  that he threatened the government with a hunger strike were it not to honour the plans     The result was that Channel   as seen by the rest of the United Kingdom would be replaced in Wales by Sianel Pedwar Cymru  S C    Channel Four Wales    Operated by a specially created authority  S C would air programmes in Welsh made by HTV  the BBC and independent companies  Initially limited frequency space meant that Channel   could not be broadcast alongside S C  though some Channel   programmes would be aired at less popular times on the Welsh variant  this practice continued until the closure of S C s analogue transmissions in       at which time S C became a fully Welsh channel  With this conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital terrestrial broadcasting on    March       Channel   became a UK wide television channel for the first time  Since then  carriage on digital cable  satellite and digital terrestrial has introduced Channel   to Welsh homes where it is now universally available   Launch and IBA control The first voice heard on Channel   s opening day of Tuesday   November      was that of continuity announcer Paul Coia who said   Good afternoon  It s a pleasure to be able to say to you  welcome to Channel Four     Following the announcement  the channel headed into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station s signature tune   Fourscore   written by David Dundas  which would form the basis of the station s jingles for its first decade  The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show Countdown  at       produced by Yorkshire Television  The first person to be seen on Channel   was Richard Whiteley with Ted Moult being the second  The first woman on the channel  contrary to popular belief  was not Whiteley s Countdown co host Carol Vorderman but a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary  Whiteley opened the show with the words   As the countdown to a brand new channel ends  a brand new countdown begins     On its first day  Channel   also broadcast soap opera Brookside  which often ran storylines thought to be controversial  this ran until       At its launch  Channel   committed itself to providing an alternative to the existing channels  an agenda in part set out by its remit which required the provision of programming to minority groups  In step with its remit  the channel became well received both by minority groups and the arts and cultural worlds during this period  especially under founding chief executive Jeremy Isaacs  where the channel gained a reputation for programmes on the contemporary arts  Channel   co commissioned Robert Ashley s ground breaking television opera Perfect Lives     which it premiered over several episodes in       The channel often did not receive mass audiences for much of this period  however  as might be expected for a station focusing on minority interest  Channel   also began the funding of independent films  such as the Merchant Ivory docudrama The Courtesans of Bombay  during this time  In       Channel   also faced its first libel case by Jani Allan  a South African journalist  who objected to her representation in Nick Broomfield s documentary The Leader  His Driver and the Driver s Wife     In September       the channel broadcast the direct to TV documentary film Beyond Citizen Kane  in which it displayed the dominant position of the Rede Globo television network  and discussed its influence  power and political connections in Brazil   Channel Four Television Corporation Main article  Channel Four Television Corporation  Channel   headquarters      Horseferry Road  London  In      Channel   opened a new national headquarters in the redeveloped Majestic Building on City Square  Leeds  After control of the station passed from the Channel Four Television Company to the Channel Four Television Corporation in       a shift in broadcasting style took place  Instead of aiming for the fringes of society  it began to focus on the edges of the mainstream  and the centre of the mass market itself         It began to show many US programmes in peak viewing time  far more than it had previously done  It gave such shows as Friends and ER their UK premi res  In the early     s  Channel   began broadcasting reality formats such as Big Brother and obtained the rights to broadcast mass appeal sporting events like cricket and horse racing  This new direction increased ratings and revenues  In addition  the corporation launched a number of new television channels through its new  Ventures offshoot  including Film   At the Races  E  and More   Partially in reaction to its new  populist  direction  the Communications Act      directed the channel to demonstrate innovation  experimentation and creativity  appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society  and to include programmes of an educational nature which exhibit a distinctive character      On    December       Channel   launched a new look and new idents in which the logo is disguised as different objects and the   can be seen in an angle  Under the leadership of Freeview founder Andy Duncan       saw a change of direction for Channel   s digital channels  Channel   made E  free to air on digital terrestrial television  and launched a new free to air digital channel called More   By October  Channel   had joined the Freeview consortium      By July       Film  had likewise become free to air and restarted broadcasting on digital terrestrial      Venturing into radio broadcasting       saw Channel   purchase     of shares in the now defunct Oneword radio station with UBC Media holding on to the remaining shares  New programmes such as the weekly  half hour The Morning Report news programme were among some of the new content Channel   provided for the station  with the name  Radio being used  As of early       however  Channel   s future involvement in radio remained uncertain  On   November       the station celebrated its   th birthday  It showed the first episode of Countdown  an anniversary Countdown special  as well as a special edition of The Big Fat Quiz and using the original multicoloured           blocks logo on presentation and idents using the Fourscore jingle throughout the day  In November       Channel   launched a week of  D television  broadcasting selected programmes each night using stereoscopic ColorCode  D technology  The accompanying  D glasses were distributed through Sainsbury s supermarkets      On    September       Channel   revamped its presentation for a fifth time  the new branding downplayed the     logo from most on air usage  in favour of using the shapes from the logo in various forms  Four new idents were filmed by Jonathan Glazer  which featured the shapes in various real world scenes depicting the  discovery  and  origins  of the shapes  The full logo was still occasionally used  but primarily for off air marketing  Channel   also commissioned two new corporate typefaces   Chadwick   and  Horseferry   a variation of Chadwick with the aforementioned shapes incorporated into its letter forms   for use across promotional material and on air          On    October       Channel   introduced a new series of idents continuing the theme  this time depicting the logo shapes as having formed an anthropomorphic  giant  character       Recent history Before the digital switch over  Channel   raised concerns over how it might finance its public service obligations afterward  It was announced in April      that Channel   s digital switch over costs would be paid for by licence fee revenues      On    March       Channel   announced plans to launch a music channel   Music  as a joint venture with British media company EMAP  which would include carriage on the Freeview platform  On    August        Music was launched across the UK      Channel   announced interest in launching a high definition version of Film  on Freeview  to coincide with the launch of Channel   HD          However  the fourth HD slot was given to Channel   instead      Channel   has since acquired a     stake in EMAP s TV business for a reported     million      Channel   was considered for privatisation by the governments of Margaret Thatcher  John Major and Tony Blair      As of      update  the future of the channel was again being looked into by the government  with analysts suggesting several options for the channel s future      In June       it was announced that Alex Mahon would be the next chief executive  and would take over from David Abraham  who left in November                Public service remit Channel   was established with  and continues to hold  a remit of public service obligations which it must fulfil  The remit changes periodically  as dictated by various broadcasting and communications acts  and is regulated by the various authorities Channel   has been answerable to  originally the IBA  then the ITC and now Ofcom  The preamble of the remit as per the Communications Act      states that     The public service remit for Channel   is the provision of a broad range of high quality and diverse programming which  in particular   demonstrates innovation  experiment and creativity in the form and content of programmes  appeals to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society  makes a significant contribution to meeting the need for the licensed public service channels to include programmes of an educational nature and other programmes of educative value  and exhibits a distinctive character            The remit also involves an obligation to provide programming for schools      and a substantial amount of programming produced outside of Greater London       Carriage Channel   was carried from its beginning on analogue terrestrial  which was practically the only means of television broadcast in the United Kingdom at the time  It continued to be broadcast through these means until the changeover to digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom was complete  Since       it has been universally available on digital terrestrial  and the Sky platform  initially encrypted  though encryption was dropped on    April      and is now free of charge and available on the Freesat platform  as well as having been available from various times in various areas  on analogue and digital cable networks  Due to its special status as a public service broadcaster with a specific remit  it is afforded free carriage on the terrestrial platforms      in contrast with other broadcasters such as ITV      Channel   is also seen outside the United Kingdom where it is widely available in Ireland  especially in border counties which have been able to receive terrestrial transmissions from Northern Ireland as well as on Irish cable networks  and Switzerland      Since       it has been offered by British Forces Broadcasting Service  BFBS  to members of HM Forces and their families around the world   BFBS Extra having previously carried a selection of Channel   programmes      The Channel   website allows Internet users in the United Kingdom to watch Channel   live on the Internet  In the past some programmes  mostly international imports  were not shown  Channel   is also provided by Virgin Mobile s DAB mobile TV service which has the same restrictions as the Internet live stream had  Channel   is also carried by the Internet TV service TVCatchup      and was previously carried by Zattoo until the operator removed the channel from its platform      Channel   also makes some of its programming available  on demand  via cable and the Internet through All     Funding During the station s formative years  funding came from the ITV companies in return for their right to sell advertisements in their region on the fourth channel  Nowadays it pays for itself in much the same way as most privately run commercial stations  i e  through the sale of on air advertising  programme sponsorship  and the sale of any programme content and merchandising rights it owns  such as overseas sales and video sales  For example  as of      update  its total revenues were      million with     derived from sale of advertising      It also has the ability to subsidise the main network through any profits made on the corporation s other endeavours  which have in the past included subscription fees from stations such as E  and Film   now no longer subscription services  and its  video on demand  sales  In practice  however  these other activities are loss making  and are subsidised by the main network  According to Channel   s last published accounts  for       the extent of this cross subsidy was some     million      The change in funding came about under the Broadcasting Act      when the new corporation was afforded the ability to fund itself  Originally this arrangement left a  safety net  guaranteed minimum income should the revenue fall too low  funded by large insurance payments made to the ITV companies  Such a subsidy was never required  however  and these premiums were phased out by the government in       After the link with ITV was cut  the cross promotion which had existed between ITV and Channel   also ended  In       owing to severe funding difficulties  the channel sought government help and was granted a payment of     million over a six year period  The money was to have come from the television licence fee  and would have been the first time that money from the licence fee had been given to any broadcaster other than the BBC      However  the plan was scrapped by the Secretary of State for Culture  Media and Sport  Andy Burnham  ahead of  broader decisions about the future framework of public service broadcasting       The broadcasting regulator Ofcom released its review in January      in which it suggested that Channel   would preferably be funded by  partnerships  joint ventures or mergers        Programming Main article  List of Channel   television programmes Channel   is a  publisher broadcaster   meaning that it commissions or  buys  all of its programming from companies independent of itself  It was the first broadcaster in the United Kingdom to do so on any significant scale  such commissioning is a stipulation which is included in its licence to broadcast      This had the consequence of starting an industry of production companies that did not have to rely on owning an ITV licence to see their programmes air  though since Channel    external commissioning has become regular practice on the numerous stations that have launched since  as well as on the BBC and in ITV  where a quota of     minimum of total output has been imposed since the Broadcasting Act      came into force   Although it was the first British broadcaster to commission all of its programmes from third parties  Channel   was the last terrestrial broadcaster to outsource its transmission and playout operations  to Red Bee Media   after    years in house      The requirement to obtain all content externally is stipulated in its licence      Additionally  Channel   also began a trend of owning the copyright and distribution rights of the programmes it aired  in a manner that is similar to the major Hollywood studios  ownership of television programmes that they did not directly produce  citation needed  Thus  although Channel   does not produce programmes  many are seen as belonging to it  It was established with a specific intention of providing programming to groups of minority interests  not catered for by its competitors  which at the time were only the BBC and ITV     Channel   also pioneered the concept of  stranded programming   where seasons of programmes following a common theme would be aired and promoted together  Some would be very specific  and run for a fixed period of time  the   Mation season  for example  showed innovative animation  Other  less specific strands  were  and still are  run regularly  such as T   a strand of programming aimed at teenagers  on weekend mornings  and weekdays during school college holidays   Friday Night Comedy  a slot where the channel would pioneer its style of comedy commissions   Music  now a separate channel  and  Later  an eclectic collection of offbeat programmes transmitted in the early hours of the morning  In its earlier years  certain risqu  art house films  dubbed by many of Channel   s critics as being pornographic  would be screened with a red triangle digital on screen graphic in the upper right of the screen  Other films were broadcast under the Film on Four banner  before the FilmFour brand was launched in the late     s   Most watched programmes The following is a list of the    most watched

produced by a rotating line up of alternative comedians went under the title of The Comic Strip Presents  The Tube and Saturday Live Friday Night Live also launched the careers of a number of comedians and writers  Channel   broadcast a number of popular American imports  including Roseanne  Friends  Sex and the City  South Park and Will   Grace  Other significant US acquisitions include The Simpsons  for which the station was reported to have paid          per episode for the terrestrial television rights  In April       Channel   became the first UK broadcaster to adapt the American comedy institution of roasting to British television  with A Comedy Roast          In       Channel   organised Channel   s Comedy Gala  a comedy benefit show in aid of Great Ormond Street Children s Hospital  With over    comedians appearing  it billed it as  the biggest live stand up show in United Kingdom history   Filmed live on    March in front of        at The O  Arena in London  it was broadcast on   April      This has continued to        Factual and current affairs Channel   has a strong reputation for history programmes and real life documentaries  It has also courted controversy  for example by broadcasting live the first public autopsy in the UK for     years  carried out by Gunther von Hagens in       or the      one off stunt Derren Brown Plays Russian Roulette Live  Its news service  Channel   News  is supplied by ITN whilst its long standing investigative documentary series  Dispatches  attracts perennial media attention   FourDocs FourDocs is an online documentary site provided by Channel    It allows viewers to upload their own documentaries to the site for others to view  It focuses on documentaries of between   and   minutes  The website also includes an archive of classic documentaries  interviews with documentary filmmakers and short educational guides to documentary making  It won a Peabody Award in           The site also includes a strand for documentaries of under    seconds  called  Microdocs    Schools programming Channel   is obliged to carry schools programming as part of its remit and licence       ITV Schools on Channel   Main article  ITV Schools On Channel   Since      ITV had produced schools programming  which became an obligation      In       five years after the station was launched  the IBA afforded ITV free carriage of these programmes during Channel   s then unused weekday morning hours  This arrangement allowed the ITV companies to fulfil their obligation to provide schools programming  whilst allowing ITV itself to broadcast regular programmes complete with advertisements  During the times in which schools programmes were aired Central Television provided most of the continuity with play out originating from Birmingham       Channel   Schools  Learning After the restructuring of the station in       ITV s obligations to provide such programming on Channel   s airtime passed to Channel   itself  and the new service became Channel   Schools  with the new corporation administering the service and commissioning its programmes  some still from ITV  others from independent producers      In March       the  Learning interactive new media commission slabovia tv was launched  The Slabplayer online media player showing TV shows for teenagers was launched on    May       The schools programming has always had elements which differ from its normal presentational package  In       the Channel   Schools idents featured famous people in one category  with light shining on them in front of an industrial looking setting supplemented by instrumental calming music  This changed in      with the circles look to numerous children touching the screen  forming circles of information then picked up by other children  The last child would produce the channel   logo in the form of three vertical circles  with another in the middle and to the left containing the Channel   logo  A present feature of presentation was a countdown sequence featuring  in      a slide with the programme name  and afterwards an extended sequence matching the channel branding  In       this was an extended ident with timer in top left corner  and in      following the adoption of the squares look  featured a square with timer slowly make its way across the right of the screen with people learning and having fun while doing so passing across the screen  It finished with the Channel   logo box on the right of the screen and the name  Channel   Schools  being shown  This was adapted in      when the service s name was changed to   Learning   citation needed  In       this was altered to various scenes from classrooms around the world and different parts of school life  The countdown now flips over from the top  right  bottom and left with each second  and ends with four coloured squares  three of which are aligned vertically to the left of the Channel   logo  which is contained inside the fourth box  The tag  Learning  is located directly beneath the logo  The final countdown sequence lasted between      and      and featured a background video of current controversial issues  overlaid with upcoming programming information  the video features people in the style of graffiti enacting the overuse of CCTV cameras  fox hunting  computer viruses and pirate videos  relationships  pollution of the seas and violent lifestyles  Following       no branded section has been used for Schools programmes  citation needed   Religious programmes From the outset  Channel   did not conform to the expectations of conventional religious broadcasting in the UK  John Ranelagh  first Commissioning Editor for Religion  made his priority  broadening the spectrum of religious programming  and more  intellectual  concerns      He also ignored the religious programme advisory structure that had been put in place by the BBC  and subsequently adopted by ITV  Ranelagh s first major commission caused a furore  a three part documentary series called Jesus  The Evidence  The programmes  transmitted during the Easter period of       seemed to advocate the idea that the Gospels were unreliable  Jesus may have indulged in witchcraft  and that he may not have even existed  The series triggered a public outcry  and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the UK s broadcasting and religious institutions       Film Numerous genres of film making   such as comedy  drama  documentary  adventure action  romance and horror thriller   are represented in the channel s schedule  From the launch of Channel   until       film presentations on C  would often be broadcast under the  Film on Four  banner          In March       Channel   screened the uncut Lars von Trier film The Idiots  which includes unsimulated sexual intercourse  making it the first UK terrestrial channel to do so  The channel had previously screened other films with similar material but censored and with warnings          Since   November       Channel   has had a digital subsidiary channel dedicated to the screening of films  This channel launched as a paid subscription channel under the name  FilmFour   and was relaunched in July      as a free to air channel under the current name of  Film    The Film  channel carries a wide range of film productions  including acquired and Film  produced projects  Channel   s general entertainment channels E  and More  also screen feature films at certain points in the schedule as part of their content mix       Wank Week Main article  Wank Week A season of television programmes about masturbation  called Wank Week  was to be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel   in March       The first show was about a Masturbate a thon  a public mass masturbation event  organised to raise money for the sexual health charity Marie Stopes International  Another film would have focused on compulsive male masturbators and a third was to feature the sex educator Dr Betty Dodson  The series came under public attack from senior television figures  and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel s public service broadcasting credentials       Global warming On   March       Channel   screened a highly controversial documentary  The Great Global Warming Swindle  The programme states that global warming is  a lie  and  the biggest scam of modern times       The programme s accuracy has been disputed on multiple points  and several commentators have criticised it for being one sided  noting that the mainstream position on global warming is supported by the scientific academies of the major industrialised nations      There were     complaints to Ofcom as of    April           including allegations that the programme falsified data      The programme has been criticised by scientists and scientific organisations  and various scientists who participated in the documentary claimed their views had been distorted      Against Nature  An earlier controversial Channel   programme made by Martin Durkin which was also critical of the environmental movement and was charged by the Independent Television Commission of the UK for misrepresenting and distorting the views of interviewees by selective editing          The Greenhouse Conspiracy  An earlier Channel   documentary broadcast on    August       as part of the Equinox series  in which similar claims were made      Three of the people interviewed  Lindzen  Michaels and Spencer  were also interviewed in The Great Global Warming Swindle   Ahmadinejad s Christmas speech In the Alternative Christmas address of       a Channel   tradition since      with a different presenter each year  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a thinly veiled attack on the United States by claiming that Christ would have been against  bullying  ill tempered and expansionist powers   The airing courted controversy and was rebuked by several human rights activists  politicians and religious figures  including Peter Tatchell      Louise Ellman      Ron Prosor     and Rabbi Aaron Goldstein      A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said   President Ahmadinejad has  during his time in office  made a series of appalling anti Semitic statements  The British media are rightly free to make their own editorial choices  but this invitation will cause offence and bemusement not just at home but among friendly countries abroad       However  some defended Channel    Stonewall director Ben Summerskill stated   In spite of his ridiculous and often offensive views  it is an important way of reminding him that there are some countries where free speech is not repressed   If it serves that purpose  then Channel   will have done a significant public service       Dorothy Byrne  Channel   s head of news and current affairs  also defended the station  saying   As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East  President Ahmadinejad s views are enormously influential    As we approach a critical time in international relations  we are offering our viewers an insight into an alternative world view   Channel   has devoted more airtime to examining Iran than any other broadcaster and this message continues a long tradition of offering a different perspective on the world around us         Talent  Talent is an editorial branch of Channel   s commissioning wing  which co ordinates Channel   s various talent development schemes for film  television  radio  new media and other platforms and provides a showcasing platform for new talent  There are bases in London  Birmingham  Glasgow and Belfast  serving editorial hubs known respectively as  Talent National   Talent Central England   Talent Scotland and  Talent Northern Ireland  These four sites include features  profiles and interviews in text  audio and video formats  divided into five zones  TV  Film  Radio  New Media and Extras  which covers other arts such as theatre  music and design   Talent also collates networking  showcasing and professional development opportunities  and runs workshops  masterclasses  seminars and showcasing events across the UK    Talent Magazine  Talent magazine is the creative industries magazine from  Talent  which launched in      as TEN  magazine under the editorship of Dan Jones   Talent Magazine is currently edited by Nick Carson  Other staff include deputy editor Catherine Bray and production editor Helen Byrne  The magazine covers rising and established figures of interest in the creative industries  a remit including film  radio  TV  comedy  music  new media and design  Subjects are usually UK based  with contributing editors based in Northern Ireland  Scotland  London and Birmingham  but the publication has been known to source international content from Australia  America  continental Europe and the Middle East  The magazine is frequently organised around a theme for the issue  for instance giving half of November      s pages over to profiling winners of the annual  Talent Awards  An unusual feature of the magazine s credits is the equal prominence given to the names of writers  photographers  designers and illustrators  contradicting standard industry practice of more prominent writer bylines  It is also recognisable for its  wraparound  covers  which use the front and back as a continuous canvas   often produced by guest artists  Although  Talent Magazine is technically a newsstand title  a significant proportion of its readers are subscribers  It started life as a quarterly     page title  but has since doubled in size and is now published bi annually   Presentation Since its launch in       Channel   has used the same logo which consists of a stylised numeral     made up of nine differently shaped blocks  The logo was designed by Martin Lambie Nairn and his partner  Colin Robinson  and was the first channel in the UK to depict an ident made using advanced computer generation  the first electronically generated ident was on BBC  in       but this was two dimensional   It was designed in conjunction with Bo Gehring Aviation of Los Angeles and originally depicted the     in red  yellow  green  blue and purple  The music accompanying the ident was called  Fourscore  and was composed by David Dundas  it was later released as a single alongside a B side   Fourscore Two   although neither reached the UK charts  In November        Fourscore  was replaced by new music  In       Channel   commissioned Tomato Films to revamp the      which resulted in the  Circles  idents showing four white circles forming up transparently over various scenes  with the     logo depicted in white in one of the circles  In       Spin redesigned the logo to feature in a single square which sat on the right hand side of the screen  whilst various stripes would move along from left to right  often lighting the squared     up  Like previous  Circles  idents from       which was made by Tomato Films   the stripes would be interspersed with various scenes potentially related to the upcoming programme  The logo was made three dimensional again in      when it was depicted in filmed scenes that show the blocks forming the     logo for less than a second before the action moves away again  In       the logo was disassembled completely to allow the blocks to appear as parts of a nature scene  sometimes featuring a strange dancing creature and sometimes being excavated for scientific study  one being studied under a microscope and showing a tardigrade  The second wave of these idents  launched in       depict a giant creature made of the     blocks  made to look almost like a person  interacting with everyday life  sometimes shouting the  Fourscore  theme as a foghorn   On air identity     Channel   logo from      to            Channel   logo from      to            Channel   logo from      to            Channel   logo from      to            Channel   logo from      to the present day     Regions International Channel   has  since its inception  broadcast identical programmes and continuity throughout the United Kingdom  excluding Wales where it did not operate on analogue transmitters   At launch this made it unique  as both the BBC and ITV had long established traditions of providing regional variations in their programming in different areas of the country  Since the launch of subsequent British television channels  Channel   has become typical in its lack of regional programming variations  A few exceptions exist to this rule for programming and continuity  Some of Channel   s schools  programming      s early    s  was regionalised due to differences in curricula between different regions      Part of Channel   s remit covers the commissioning of programmes from outside London  Channel   has a dedicated director of nations and regions  Stuart Cosgrove  who is based in a regional office in Glasgow  As his job title suggests  it is his responsibility to foster relations with independent producers based in areas of the United Kingdom  including Wales  outside London  Advertising on Channel   does contain regular variation  prior to       when ITV was responsible for selling Channel   s advertising  each regional ITV company would provide the content of advertising breaks  covering the same transmitter area as themselves  and these breaks were often unique to that area  After Channel   became responsible for its own advertising  it continued to offer advertisers the ability to target particular audiences and divided its coverage area into six regions  London  South  including Wales    Midlands  North  Northern Ireland and Scotland      At present  Wales does not have its own advertising region  instead its viewers receive the southern region on digital platforms intentionally broadcast to the area  or the neighbouring region where terrestrial transmissions spill over into Wales  The Republic of Ireland shares its advertising region with Northern Ireland  referred to by Channel   as the  Ulster Macro   with many advertisers selling products for Ireland here      E  has an advertising variant for Ireland  although Northern Ireland receives the UK version of E       The six regions are also carried on satellite  cable and Digital Terrestrial  Channel   and ITV Breakfast use a similar model to Channel   for providing their own advertising regions  despite also having a single national output of programming  Despite the Republic of Ireland not being in the UK  Channel   has a dedicated variant broadcast on Sky Ireland which omits programmes for which broadcast rights are not held in Ireland  For example  the series Glee is not available on Channel   on Sky in Ireland  In recent years a Republic of Ireland advertising opt out has been added to this version   Future possibility of regional news With ITV plc pushing for much looser requirements on the amount of regional news and other programming it is obliged to broadcast in its ITV regions  the idea of Channel   taking on a regional news commitment has been considered  with the corporation in talks with Ofcom and ITV over the matter      Channel   believe that a scaling back of such operations on ITV s part would be detrimental to Channel   s national news operation  which shares much of its resources with ITV through their shared news contractor ITN  At the same time  Channel   also believe that such an additional public service commitment would bode well in on going negotiations with Ofcom in securing additional funding for its other public service commitments       Channel   HD  The Channel   HD logo used from      until       In mid      Channel   ran a six month closed trial of HDTV  as part of the wider Freeview HD experiment via the Crystal Palace transmitter to London and parts of the home counties      including the use of Lost and Desperate Housewives as part of the experiment  as US broadcasters such as ABC already have an HDTV back catalogue  On    December       Channel   launched a high definition television simulcast of Channel   on Sky s digital satellite platform  after Sky agreed to contribute toward the channel s satellite distribution costs  It was the first full time high definition channel from a terrestrial UK broadcaster      On    July       Virgin Media added Channel   HD on channel      later on channel      now on channel      as a part of the M pack      On    March      Channel   HD appeared on Freeview channel    with a placeholding caption  ahead of a commercial launch on    March       coinciding with the commercial launch of Freeview HD          On    April       Channel   HD was added to Freesat on channel          As a consequence  the channel moved from being free to view to free to air on satellite during March       With the closure of S C Clirlun in Wales on   December       on Freeview  Channel   HD launched in Wales on   December           The channel carries the same schedule as Channel    broadcasting programmes in HD when available  acting as a simulcast  Therefore  SD programming is broadcast upscaled to HD    The first true HD programme to be shown was the      Adam Sandler film Happy Gilmore   From launch until      the presence of the  HD logo on screen denoted true HD content  On   July       Channel      HD  a HD simulcast of Channel       launched on Freeview channel      It closed on    June      to help make room on COM  following the closure of COM  on Freeview  On    February       Channel   announced that Channel   HD and All   will no longer be supplied on Freesat from Thursday    February           On    June      Channel    HD and  Seven HD were removed from Freeview       All   Main article  All   All   is a video on demand service from Channel    launched in November
