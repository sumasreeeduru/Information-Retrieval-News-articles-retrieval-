First Libyan Civil War was an armed conflict in      in the North African country of Libya fought between forces loyal to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and foreign supported groups seeking to oust his government          It erupted with the Libyan Revolution      also known as the    February Revolution      The war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on   August      and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday     February       which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd      The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country      with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body  the National Transitional Council  The United Nations Security Council passed an initial resolution on    February  freezing the assets of Gaddafi and his inner circle and restricting their travel  and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court for investigation      In early March  Gaddafi s forces rallied  pushed eastwards and re took several coastal cities before reaching Benghazi  A further UN resolution authorised member states to establish and enforce a no fly zone over Libya  and to use  all necessary measures  to prevent attacks on civilians      which turned into a bombing campaign by the forces of NATO against military installations and civilian infrastructure of Libya  The Gaddafi government then announced a ceasefire  but fighting and bombing continued          Throughout the conflict  rebels rejected government offers of a ceasefire and efforts by the African Union to end the fighting because the plans set forth did not include the removal of Gaddafi      In August  rebel forces launched an offensive on the government held coast of Libya  backed by a wide reaching NATO bombing campaign  taking back territory lost months before and ultimately capturing the capital city of Tripoli      while Gaddafi evaded capture and loyalists engaged in a rearguard campaign      On    September       the National Transitional Council was recognised by the United Nations as the legal representative of Libya  replacing the Gaddafi government  Muammar Gaddafi evaded capture until    October       when he was captured and killed in Sirte      The National Transitional Council  declared the liberation of Libya  and the official end of the war on    October           In the aftermath of the civil war  a low level insurgency by former Gaddafi loyalists continued  There have been various disagreements and strife between local militia and tribes  including fighting on    January      in the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid  leading to an alternative town council being established and later recognized by the National Transitional Council  NTC           A much greater issue has been the role of militias which fought in the civil war and their role in the new Libya  Some have refused to disarm  and cooperation with the NTC has been strained  leading to demonstrations against militias and government action to disband such groups or integrate them into the Libyan military      These unresolved issues led directly to a second civil war in Libya

Gaddafi was the head of the Free Officers  a group of Arab nationalists that deposed King Idris I in      in a  bloodless coup       He abolished the Libyan Constitution of       considering it a neocolonial document  From      until      standards of living  life expectancy and literacy grew rapidly  In      he published his manifesto The Green Book  He officially stepped down from power in       and subsequently claimed to be merely a  symbolic figurehead  until       with the Libyan government up until then also denying that he held any power          Under Gaddafi  Libya was theoretically a decentralized  direct democracy     state run according to the philosophy of Gaddafi s The Green Book  with Gaddafi retaining a ceremonial position  Libya was officially run by a system of people s committees which served as local governments for the country s subdivisions  an indirectly elected General People s Congress as the legislature  and the General People s Committee  led by a Secretary General  as the executive branch  According to Freedom House  however  these structures were often manipulated to ensure the dominance of Gaddafi  who reportedly continued to dominate all aspects of government      WikiLeaks  disclosure of confidential US diplomatic cables revealed US diplomats there speaking of Gaddafi s  mastery of tactical maneuvering       While placing relatives and loyal members of his tribe in central military and government positions  he skilfully marginalized supporters and rivals  thus maintaining a delicate balance of powers  stability and economic developments  This extended even to his own sons  as he repeatedly changed affections to avoid the rise of a clear successor and rival      Both Gaddafi and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  however  officially denied that he held any power  but said that he was merely a symbolic figurehead          While he was popularly seen as a demagogue in the West  Gaddafi always portrayed himself as a statesman philosopher      According to several Western media sources  Gaddafi feared a military coup against his government and deliberately kept Libya s military relatively weak  The Libyan Army consisted of about        personnel  Its most powerful units were four crack brigades of highly equipped and trained soldiers  composed of members of Gaddafi s tribe or members of other tribes loyal to him  One  the Khamis Brigade  was led by his son Khamis  Local militias and Revolutionary Committees across the country were also kept well armed  By contrast  regular military units were poorly armed and trained  and were armed with largely outdated military equipment               Development and corruption edit  By the end of Gaddafi s    year rule  Libya s population had a per capita income of          though a third was estimated to still live below the national poverty line      A broadly secular society was imposed      Child marriage was banned  and women enjoyed equality of equal pay for equal work  equal rights in divorce and access to higher education rose from    in      to     in       equal to that of men      Homelessness was insignificant  with literacy rates estimated at      and average life expectancy rose from       in      to                Much of the state s income came from its oil production  which soared in the     s  In the     s  a large portion of it was spent on arms purchases  and on sponsoring militant groups and independence movements around the world          Libya s economy is structured primarily around the nation s energy sector  which generates about     of export earnings      of GDP  and     of government income  Libya s GDP per capita  PPP   human development index  and literacy rate were better than in Egypt and Tunisia  whose Arab Spring revolutions preceded the outbreak of protests in Libya      Libya s corruption perception index in      was      ranking    th out of     countries  worse than that of Egypt  ranked   th  and Tunisia  ranked   th       One paper speculated that such a situation created a broader contrast between good education  high demand for democracy  and the government s practices  perceived corruption  political system  supply of democracy       An estimated     of Libyan citizens were unemployed      More than     of families had no members earning a stable income  and       had just one  Despite one of the highest unemployment rates in the region  there was a consistent labor shortage with over a million migrant workers present on the market      These migrant workers were the bulk of the refugees leaving Libya after the beginning of hostilities  Despite this  Libya s Human Development Index in      was the highest in Africa and greater than that of Saudi Arabia  Libya had welfare systems allowing access to free education  free healthcare  and financial assistance for housing  and the Great Manmade River was built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country       Some of the worst economic conditions were in the eastern parts of the state  once a breadbasket of the ancient world  where Gaddafi extracted oil            Except for housing improvements and the Great Manmade River  little infrastructure was developed in this region for many years       For example  the only sewage facility in Benghazi was over    years old  and untreated sewage has resulted in environmental problems       Several foreign governments and analysts have stated that a large share of the business enterprise was controlled by Gaddafi  his family  and the government       A leaked US diplomatic cable said that the Libyan economy was  a kleptocracy in which the government   either the Gaddafi family itself or its close political allies   has a direct stake in anything worth buying  selling or owning        According to US officials  Gaddafi amassed a vast personal fortune during his    year leadership       The New York Times pointed to Gaddafi s relatives adopting lavish lifestyles  including luxurious homes  Hollywood film investments  and private parties with American pop stars            Gaddafi said that he planned to combat corruption in the state by proposing reforms where oil profits are handed out directly to the country s five million people      rather than to government bodies  stating that  as long as money is administered by a government body  there would be theft and corruption        Gaddafi urged a sweeping reform of the government bureaucracy  suggesting that most of the cabinet system should be dismantled to  free Libyans from red tape  and  protect the state s budget from corruption   According to Western diplomats  this move appeared to be aimed at putting pressure on the government to speed up reforms       In March       Gaddafi proposed plans to dissolve the country s existing administrative structure and disburse oil revenue directly to the people  The plan included abolishing all ministries except those of defence  internal security  and foreign affairs  and departments implementing strategic projects       He stated that the ministries were failing to manage the country s oil revenues       and that his  dream during all these years was to give power and wealth directly to the people        A national vote on Gaddafi s plan was held in       where Libya s people s congresses  collectively the country s highest authority  voted to delay implementation  The General People s Congress announced that  of     Basic People s Congresses     chose immediate implementation while     endorsed implementation  but asked for  it  to be delayed until appropriate measures were put in place   Some top government officials opposed the plan  saying that it would  wreak havoc  in the economy by  fanning inflation and spurring capital flight   Gaddafi acknowledged that the scheme  which promised up to        Libyan dinars           annually to about a million of Libya s poorest  may  cause chaos before it brought about prosperity   but said  do not be afraid to experiment with a new form of government  and that  this plan is to offer a better future for Libya s children              Human rights in Libya edit  Further information  Human rights in Libya In      and       the Freedom of the Press Index rated Libya the most censored state in the Middle East and North Africa            In contrast  a January      report of the United Nations Human Rights Council  on which the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya sat prior to the uprising  released a month before protests began  praised certain aspects of the country s human rights record  including its treatment of women and improvements in other areas       The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya s delegation to the United Nations issued a report about human rights in Libya  The report said that the country was founded on direct people s democracy that guaranteed direct exercise of authority by all citizens through the people s congresses  Citizens were said to be able to express opinions to the congresses on political  economic  social  and cultural issues  In addition  the report stated that there were information platforms such as newspapers and TV channels for people to express their opinions through  Libyan authorities also argued that no one in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya suffered from extreme poverty and hunger  and that the government guaranteed a minimum of food and essential needs to people with low incomes  In       an initiative was adopted for providing people with low incomes investment portfolios amounting to         to be deposited with banks and companies       The Revolutionary Committees occasionally kept tight control over internal dissent  reportedly      to     of Libyans worked as informants for these committees  with surveillance taking place in the government  in factories  and in the education sector       The government sometimes executed dissidents through public hangings and mutilations and re broadcast them on public television channels            Until the mid     s  Libya s intelligence service conducted assassinations of Libyan dissidents around the world            In December       Gaddafi reportedly told government officials that Libya would soon experience a  new political period  and would have elections for important positions such as minister level roles and the National Security Advisor position  a Prime Minister equivalent   He also promised that international monitors would be included to ensure fair elections  His speech was said to have caused a stir  These elections were planned to coincide with the Jamahiriya s usual periodic elections for the Popular Committees  Basic People s Committees  Basic People s Congresses  and General People s Congresses  in            Dissent was illegal under Law    of       and in       Gaddafi asserted that anyone guilty of founding a political party would be executed       With the establishment of the Jamahiriya   state of the masses   system in       he established the Revolutionary Committees as conduits for raising political consciousness  with the aim of direct political participation by all Libyans rather than a traditional party based representative system       In       some of the Revolutionary Committees had eventually evolved into self appointed  sometimes zealous  enforcers of revolutionary orthodoxy       During the early     s  the Revolutionary Committees had considerable power and became a growing source of tension within the Jamihiriya       to the extent that Gaddafi sometimes criticized their effectiveness and excessive repression            until the power of the Revolutionary Committees was eventually restricted in the late     s       The Green Book  which Gaddafi authored in the     s  was for years the principal text of political education  BBC cited a Libyan who said that teachers who called it  rubbish  could face execution        The Great Green Document on Human Rights treats the right to life as an individual human right and calls for abolition of the death sentence  except in the case of persons whose lives endanger or corrupt society        In       Gaddafi criticized the  excesses  he blamed on the Revolutionary Councils  stating that  they deviated  harmed  tortured  and that  the true revolutionary does not practise repression        That same year  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya issued the Great Green Document on Human Rights  in which Article   established laws that allowed greater freedom of expression  Article   of The Code on the Promotion of Freedom stated that  each citizen has the right to express his opinions and ideas openly in People s Congresses and in all mass media        A number of restrictions were also allegedly placed on the power of the Revolutionary Committees by the Gaddafi government  leading to a resurgence in the Libyan state s popularity by the early     s       In       however  Libya posted a    million bounty for journalist and governmental critic Ashur Shamis  under the allegation that he was linked to Al Qaeda and terror suspect Abu Qatada        Anti Gaddafi movement edit  Beginnings of protests edit   Protests on Al Oroba Street  Bayda     January       The flag of the former Kingdom of Libya was used as an opposition flag            Between    and    January       upset at delays in the building of housing units and over political corruption  protesters in Bayda  Derna  Benghazi and other cities broke into  and occupied  housing that the government had been building  Protesters also clashed with police in Bayda and attacked government offices            By    January  the government had responded to the housing unrest with an over     billion investment fund to provide housing and development              Graffiti in Benghazi  drawing the connection to the Arab Spring In late January  Jamal al Hajji  a writer  political commentator and accountant   call ed  on the Internet for demonstrations to be held in support of greater freedoms in Libya  inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions  He was arrested on   February by plain clothes police officers  and charged on   February with injuring someone with his car  Amnesty International stated that because al Hajji had previously been imprisoned for his non violent political opinions  the real reason for the present arrest appeared to be his call for demonstrations       In early February  Gaddafi  on behalf of the Jamahiriya  met with political activists  journalists and media figures and warned them that they would be held responsible if they disturbed the peace or created chaos in Libya       The protests would lead to an uprising and civil war  as part of the wider Arab Spring            which had already resulted in the ousting of long term presidents of adjacent Tunisia and Egypt       Social media played a central role in organizing the opposition                           A social media website declared an alternative government  one that would be an interim national council  was the first to compete with Muammar Gaddafi s political authority  Gaddafi s senior advisor attempted to reject the idea by tweeting his resignation        Uprising and civil war edit  Main article  Timeline of the Libyan Civil War before military intervention  The first demonstrations in Bayda  A police car burns on    February       at the crossroads of At Talhi  now known as the Crossroads of the Spark   A girl in Benghazi with a placard saying that the Libyan tribes are united  on    February       The protests  unrest and confrontations began in earnest on   February       They were soon nicknamed the Libyan Revolution of Dignity by the protesters and foreign media       Foreign workers and disgruntled minorities protested in the main square of Zawiya  Libya against the local administration  This was succeeded by race riots  which were squashed by the police and pro Gaddafi loyalists  On the evening of    February  between     and     demonstrators protested in front of Benghazi s police headquarters after the arrest of human rights lawyer Fathi Terbil  Crowds were armed with petrol bombs and threw stones  Marchers hurled Molotov cocktails in a downtown square in Benghazi  damaging cars  blocking roads  and hurling rocks  Police responded to crowds with tear gas  water cannon  and rubber bullets          people were injured  including    security personnel            The novelist Idris Al Mesmari was arrested hours after giving an interview with Al Jazeera about the police reaction to protests       In a statement released after clashes in Benghazi  a Libyan official warned that the Government  will not allow a group of people to move around at night and play with the security of Libya   The statement added   The clashes last night were between small groups of people   up to      Some outsiders infiltrated that group  They were trying to corrupt the local legal process which has long been in place  We will not permit that at all  and we call on Libyans to voice their issues through existing channels  even if it is to call for the downfall of the government        On the night of   th of February in Beyida  Zawiya and Zintan  hundreds of protesters in each town calling for an end to the Gaddafi government set fire to police and security buildings              The Libyan National Transitional Council flag is flown from a communications tower in Bayda in July  A  Day of Rage  in Libya and by Libyans in exile was planned for    February                 The National Conference for the Libyan Opposition asked that all groups opposed to the Gaddafi government protest on    February in memory of demonstrations in Benghazi five years earlier       The plans to protest were inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution       Protests took place in Benghazi  Ajdabiya  Derna  Zintan  and Bayda  Libyan security forces fired live ammunition into the armed protests  Protesters torched a number of government buildings  including a police station            In Tripoli  television and public radio stations had been sacked  and protesters set fire to security buildings  Revolutionary Committee offices  the interior ministry building  and the People s Hall            On    February  police and army personnel later withdrew from Benghazi after being overwhelmed by protesters  Some army personnel also joined the protesters  they then seized the local radio station  In Bayda  unconfirmed reports indicated that the local police force and riot control units had joined the protesters       On    February  witnesses in Libya reported helicopters firing into crowds of anti government protesters      a claim that Amnesty International stated they found no evidence for  noting that protesters repeatedly made verifiably false claims about repression by the government            The army withdrew from the city of Bayda   Cultural revolt edit    Al Soo al   The Question        Muammar  You have never served the people Muammar  You d better give up Confess  You cannot escape Our revenge will catch you As a train roars through a wall We will drown you     Rap  hip hop and traditional music  alongside other genres  played a big role in encouraging dissent against Gaddafi s government  Music has been controlled and dissenting cultural figures have been arrested or tortured in Arab Spring countries  including Libya       Music provided an important platform for communication among demonstrators  It helped to create moral support and encouraged a spirit of revolt against the governments       An anonymous hip hop artist called Ibn Thabit gave a voice to  disenfranchised Libyans looking for a non violent way to express their political will             On his website  Ibn Thabit said that he  has been attacking Gaddafi with his music since       when he posted his first song on the internet  titled  Moammar   the coward             Lyrics of a song  Al Soo al  released by Ibn Thabit on YouTube on    January       weeks before the riots began in Libya were indicative of the rebel sentiment       Some groups  such as a rock band from Benghazi called the  Guys Underground   used metaphors to cloak the censure of the authorities  The group released a song just before the uprising entitled  Like My Father Always Says  to ridicule an autocratic fictional male head of a family which was a veiled reference to Colonel Gaddafi        Organization edit  Play media Libyan Boy Scouts helping in the social services in Benghazi  See also  National Transitional Council Many opposition participants called for a return to the      constitution and a transition to multi party democracy  Military units who joined the rebellion and many volunteers formed fighting units to defend against Jamahiriya attacks and to work to bring Tripoli under the influence of Jalil       In Tobruk  volunteers turned a former headquarters of the government into a centre for helping protesters  Volunteers reportedly guarded the port  local banks and oil terminals to keep the oil flowing  Teachers and engineers set up a committee to collect weapons       Likewise  supply lines were run by volunteers  For example  in Misrata people organised a pizza service which delivered up to       pizzas a day to fighters         A few hundred anti Gaddafi protesters in Benghazi     February      The National Transitional Council  Arabic                            was established on    February to consolidate efforts for change in the rule of Libya       The main objectives of the group was to co ordinate resistance between towns held in rebel control  and represent the opposition to the world  but did not include forming an interim government       The Benghazi based opposition government had called for a no fly zone and airstrikes against the Jamahiriya       The council began to refer to itself as the Libyan Republic and by March had a website       Former Jamahiriya Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil said in February that the new government would prepare for elections and they could be held in three months       On    March  the political and international affairs committee of the Council presented its eight point plan for Libya in The Guardian newspaper  stating they would hold free and fair elections and draft a national constitution          An independent newspaper called Libya appeared in Benghazi  as well as rebel controlled radio stations       Some of the rebels opposed tribalism and wore vests bearing slogans such as  No to tribalism  no to factionalism        Some Libyans said that they had found abandoned torture chambers and devices that had been used in the past        Composition of rebel forces edit   Court square in Benghazi     April       At the central place for gatherings and demonstrations the walls are draped with pictures of casualties  mourners passing by  The rebels primarily included civilians  such as teachers  students  lawyers  and oil workers  but also defected police officers and professional soldiers       Many Islamists were part of the rebel movement in both eastern and western Libya       Rebel group primarily initiated from Misrati  Zentan and Derna  In Benghazi  the February    Brigade  was a powerful Islamist group composed of    different brigades  The Libya Shield was based out of Mistrata and Zaria  There was also the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group      and the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade which has been held responsible for the assassination of top rebel commander General Abdul Fatah Younis       Gaddafi s administration repeatedly asserted that the rebels included al Qaeda fighters       Rebels denied this       NATO s Supreme Allied Commander James G  Stavridis stated that intelligence reports suggested there were  flickers  of al Qaeda activity among rebels  but that there was insufficient information to confirm a significant presence of terrorist groups            Gaddafi s claims are supported by a      secret cable from the US embassy in Tripoli to the US State Department  and an analysis by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy at West Point of a set of documents called the Sinjar Records  purporting to show a statistical study of the al Qaeda personnel records  The West Point analysis of these documents concluded that Libya provided  far more  foreign fighters in per capita terms than any other country       A disclosed file from      on WikiLeaks found that rebel leader Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamuda Bin Qumu was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to be a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  to have joined the Taliban in       and that he was a  probable member of Al Qaida and a member of the African Extremist Network         State response edit  Further information  Muammar Gaddafi s response to the Libyan Civil War In the days leading up to the conflict  Gaddafi called for a rally against the government that was to be held on    February  The International Crisis Group believes this to have been a political manoeuvre to divert attention away from himself and the Jamahiriya political system towards government officials currently in power       Later in February  Gaddafi stated that the rebels were influenced by Al Qaeda  Osama Bin Laden  and hallucinogenic drugs put in drinks and pills  He specifically referred to substances in milk  coffee  and Nescaf   and said that Bin Laden and Al Qaeda were distributing these hallucinogenic drugs  He also blamed alcohol            Gaddafi later also stated that the revolt against his rule was the result of a colonialist plot by foreign states  particularly blaming France  the US and the UK  to control oil and enslave the Libyan people  He referred to the rebels as  cockroaches  and  rats   and vowed not to step down and to cleanse Libya house by house until the insurrection was crushed                 He said that if the rebels laid down their arms  they would not be harmed  He also said that he had been receiving  thousands  of phone calls from Benghazi  from residents who were being held hostage and who wanted to be rescued  Gaddafi said in a speech addressed to Benghazi on    March      that the rebels  can run away  they can go to Egypt   Those who would surrender their weapons and would join our side  we are the people of Libya  Those who surrender their weapons and would come without their arms  we would forgive them  and would have amnesty for those who put down their weapons  Anyone who throws his arms away and stays at home would be protected        Libya s ambassador in Malta addressed that  many people instigating unrest were arrested  Libya will show that these belonged to Al Qaeda  Some young protestors were also misled  The government is ready to dialogue with them   He cited reports from the Libyan Foreign Ministry that up to       al Qaeda foreign operatives have been working in eastern Libya and were mostly responsible for  stirring up trouble   He concluded   What we saw in Tahrir Square  and in Tunisia  was a clear situation  But in Libya  there is something different        He called himself a  warrior   and vowed to fight on and die a  martyr   and urged his supporters to leave their homes and attack rebels  in their lairs   Gaddafi said that he had not yet ordered the use of force  and threatened that  everything will burn  when he did  Responding to demands that he step down  he stated that he could not step down  as he held a purely symbolic position like Queen Elizabeth  and that the people were in power       The Swedish peace research institute SIPRI reported flights between Tripoli and a dedicated military base in Belarus which only handles stockpiled weaponry and military equipment        Violence edit  Saif al Islam Gaddafi  in an interview with ABC on    March  stated that the rebels in Benghazi engaged in terror against the population  He stated   You know  the armoured militia yesterday  they killed four young boys in Benghazi  Why  Because they were against them  Everybody is terrified because of the armed militia  They live in terror  Nightmare  Armed people are everywhere  They have their own courts  They execute the people who are against them  No school  No hospital  No money  No banks        The Libyan government were reported to have employed snipers  artillery  helicopter gunships  warplanes  anti aircraft weaponry  and warships against demonstrations and funeral processions       It was also reported that security forces and foreign mercenaries repeatedly used firearms  including assault rifles and machine guns  as well as knives against protesters  Amnesty International initially reported that writers  intellectuals and other prominent opposition sympathizers disappeared during the early days of the conflict in Gaddafi controlled cities  and that they may have been subjected to torture or execution       In a    March      interview  shortly before the military intervention  Muammar Gaddafi s son and heir apparent Saif al Islam Gaddafi said that  armed militia  fighters in Benghazi were killing children and terrorizing the population         Rebel fighter in hospital in Tripoli Amnesty International also reported that security forces targeted paramedics helping injured protesters       In multiple incidents  Gaddafi s forces were documented using ambulances in their attacks            Injured demonstrators were sometimes denied access to hospitals and ambulance transport  The government also banned giving blood transfusions to people who had taken part in the demonstrations       Security forces  including members of Gaddafi s Revolutionary Committees  stormed hospitals and removed the dead  Injured protesters were either summarily executed or had their oxygen masks  IV drips  and wires connected to the monitors removed  The dead and injured were piled into vehicles and taken away  possibly for cremation            Doctors were prevented from documenting the numbers of dead and wounded  but an orderly in a Tripoli hospital morgue estimated to the BBC that         protesters were killed in Green Square in Tripoli on    February  The orderly said that ambulances brought in three or four corpses at a time  and that after the ice lockers were filled to capacity  bodies were placed on stretchers or the floor  and that  it was in the same at the other hospitals        In the eastern city of Bayda  anti government forces hanged two policemen who were involved in trying to disperse demonstrations  In downtown Benghazi  anti government forces killed the managing director of al Galaa hospital  The victim s body showed signs of torture       On    February  several days after the conflict began  Saif al Islam Gaddafi announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence  chaired by a Libyan judge  as reported on state television  He stated that the commission was intended to be  for members of Libyan and foreign organizations of human rights  and that it will  investigate the circumstances and events that have caused many victims          Caricature of Gaddafi  Al Bayda  April      Towards the end of February  it was reported that the Gaddafi government had suppressed protests in Tripoli by distributing automobiles  money and weapons for hired followers to drive around Tripoli and attack people showing signs of dissent       In Tripoli   death squads  of mercenaries and Revolutionary Committees members reportedly patrolled the streets and shot people who tried to take the dead off the streets or gather in groups       The International Federation for Human Rights concluded on    February that Gaddafi was implementing a scorched earth strategy  The organization stated that  It is reasonable to fear that he has  in fact  decided to largely eliminate  wherever he still can  Libyan citizens who stood up against his regime and furthermore  to systematically and indiscriminately repress civilians  These acts can be characterized as crimes against humanity  as defined in Article   of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court        In May       International Criminal Court  ICC  chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo estimated that         people were killed by security forces in February       before the rebels took up arms  According to Moreno Ocampo   shooting at protesters was systematic        During the siege of Misrata in May       Amnesty International reported  horrifying  tactics such as  indiscriminate attacks that have led to massive civilian casualties  including use of heavy artillery  rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents        Gaddafi s military commanders also reportedly executed soldiers who refused to fire on protesters       The International Federation for Human Rights reported a case where     soldiers were executed       Some of the soldiers executed by their commanders were reportedly burned alive       In June       a more detailed investigation by Amnesty International found that many of the allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to be false or to lack any credible evidence  saying that rebels at times appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence      In July       Saif al Islam Gaddafi had an interview with Russia Today in which he denied the ICC s allegations that he or his father Muammar Gaddafi ordered the killing of civilian protesters  He said that he was not a member of the government or the military and therefore had no authority to give such orders  He also said that his father made recorded calls to General Abdul Fatah Younis  who later defected to the rebel forces  in order to request not to use force against protesters  to which he said Fatah Younis responded that protesters were attacking a military site and soldiers were acting in self defense        Prison sites and torture edit  Gaddafi reportedly imprisoned thousands or tens of thousands of residents in Tripoli  with Red Cross denied access to these hidden prisons  One of the most notorious is a prison which was set up in a tobacco factory in Tripoli where inmates are reported to have been fed just half a loaf of bread and a bottle of water a day       In late April  United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice alleged that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were given Viagra and encouraged to commit rapes in rebel held or disputed areas  The allegations surfaced in an Al Jazeera report the previous month from Libya based doctors  who claimed to have found Viagra in the pockets of government soldiers       Human rights groups and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the war  The British aid agency  Save the children  said it got reports that children were raped by unknown perpetrators  but warned that these reports could not be confirmed            In a questionnaire     refugee women reported that they had been raped by Gaddafi s soldiers  however the accounts of these women could not be independently verified as the psychologist who conducted the questionnaire said that  she had lost contact with them       The validity of the rape allegations is questioned by Amnesty International  which has not found evidence to back up the claims and said that there are indications that on several occasions the rebels in Benghazi appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence       Mercenaries edit  The Libyan government alleged that the armed rebellion was composed of  criminal gangs and mercenaries        A Libyan official reported to Libyan television that security forces arrested Tunisians and Egyptians that were  trained to sow chaos        According to the Libyan Government authorities  mercenaries from Turkey  Egypt  and Tunisia entered Libya to fight on the side of the rebels  Dozens of them were arrested  Libya s Jamahiriya News Agency reported that the detained men were part of a  foreign network  and were  trained to damage Libya s stability  the safety of its citizens and national unity        Military advisors from Qatar participated on the side of the rebels       and were sometimes labelled as  mercenaries  by the media       However  Qatar s role was certainly much greater than that  Initially  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al Thani declared that the country was supporting the rebels by sending  defensive weaponry  only       A report by Sam Dagher  Charles Levinson  and Margaret Coker published by The Wall Street Journal on    October      challenged those statements  and posited that  Qatar provided anti Gadhafi rebels with what Libyan officials now estimate are tens of millions of dollars in aid  military training and more than        tons of weapons        The three columnists reported anonymous sources described as  people familiar with the shipments  who confirmed that    weapons shipments were delivered to rebel forces between spring and summer       mostly independently from the mediation of the National Transitional Council  In fact  most shipments for which Qatar paid went directly to the rebels       According to NTC allied officials interviewed by The Wall Street Journal  a few key figures facilitated Qatar s weapons and aid to flow directly to the rebels       Cleric Ali al Sallabi allegedly served as a primary  conduit for Qatari humanitarian aid  money and arms  and helped to direct more than a dozen of the Qatari shipments       His brother Ismail al Salabi  leader of the Islamist  February    Katiba  rebel faction  was believed to be financially backed from Qatar       Abdel Hakim Belhaj  the leader of Tripoli Military Council who had previously served as the leader of the      U S  terrorist designated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  LIFG   was among the privileged recipients of shipments from Qatar            Jalal al Dugheily  the NTC Defence Minister  was a Libyan army veteran who reportedly favoured Islamist militia leaders       According to David Roberts  analysis published by Foreign Policy  Belhaj   a  politically radioactive personality    met with NATO officials at the end of August       under Qatar auspices        Over ten ammunition shipments sponsored by Qatar were allegedly delivered to anti Gaddhafi forces via Sudan       Dagher  Levinson  and Coker also wrote that some government officials in Tripoli claimed that Ghaddafi s fall did not cause those shipments to be suspended  Weapons allegedly continued to be delivered to Islamist groups also in September       after the removal of Libya s government            Reuters had reported in May      that rebels from eastern Libya   where Ghaddafi s rule had ended in early February   were negotiating with Qatari banks to  facilitate international money transfers in rebel held areas  a move aimed at recapitalising banks and boosting the economy through trade        The Qatari banks involved in talks with delegates from the National Transitional Council were Qatar Islamic Bank and Qatar National Bank       According to the Reuters report  Qatar was already marketing crude petroleum from oil fields in the territories controlled by the rebels and had sent  gasoline  diesel and liquefied petroleum gas  in the same areas       Qatar also provided training to fighters based both in eastern Libya and in the Nafusa Mountains  in the Tripoli area  David Roberts reported that Libyan fighters were even brought back to Doha for special training  Finally  on    August        Qatari special forces  were involved in the final assault on Bab al Azizia compound       After clashes between Government and anti government forces  allegations arose of the Libyan Gaddafi using foreign mercenaries  The Libyan Government s ambassador to India Ali al Essawi said that the defections of military units had indeed led to such a decision       Video footage purporting to show this started to leak out of the country       Gaddafi s former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Mesmari said in an interview with the Al Jazeera that Nigerien  Malian  Chadian and Kenyan mercenaries were among foreign soldiers helping fight the uprising on behalf of Gaddafi       Chadian sources repudiated allegations that mercenaries from Chad were involved in the fighting in Libya  The Chadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement said that  Chadians are not sent or recruited in Chad to serve as mercenaries in Libya   and that allegations about Chadian mercenaries were  likely to cause serious physical and material harm to Chadians residing in Libya        According to African Union chairman Jean Ping  the  NTC seems to confuse black people with mercenaries   Ping said that for the rebels   All blacks are mercenaries  If you do that  it means  that the  one third of the population of Libya  which is black  is also mercenaries  They are killing people  normal workers  mistreating them        In Mali  members of the Tuareg tribe confirmed that a large number of men  about        from the tribe went to Libya in late February                     Locals in Mali said they were promised                  upfront payment and compensation up to               per day            Gaddafi has used Malian Tuaregs in his political projects before  sending them to fight in places like Chad  Sudan and Lebanon and recently they have fought against the Niger government  a war which Gaddafi has reportedly sponsored  Malian government officials told BBC that it is hard to stop the flow of fighters from Mali to Libya       A recruitment center for Malian soldiers leaving to Libya was found in a Bamako hotel       Reports from Ghana state that the men who went to Libya were offered as much as                per day       Advertisements seeking mercenaries were seen in Nigeria      with at least one female Nigerian pro Gaddafi sniper being caught in late August outside Tripoli       One group of mercenaries from Niger  who had been allegedly recruited from the streets with promises of money  included a soldier of just    years old      The Daily Telegraph studied the case of a    year old captured Chadian child soldier in Bayda  The boy  who had previously been a shepherd in Chad  told that a Libyan man had offered him a job and a free flight to Tripoli  but in the end he had been airlifted to shoot opposition members in Eastern Libya      Reports by EU experts stated that Gaddafi s government hired between     and     European soldiers  including some from EU countries  at high wages  According to Michel Koutouzis  who does research on security issues for the EU institutions  the UN and the French government   In Libyan society  there is a taboo against killing people from your own tribal group  This is one reason why Gaddafi needs foreign fighters        Rumours of Serbian mercenary pilots participating on the side of Gaddafi appeared early in the conflict                 Time magazine interviewed mercenaries from ex Yugoslavia who fled Gaddafi s forces in August       A witness stated that mercenaries were more willing to kill demonstrators than Libyan forces were  and earned a reputation as among the most brutal forces employed by the government  A doctor in Benghazi said of the mercenaries that  they know one thing  to kill who is in front of them  Nothing else  They re killing people in cold blood        On   April  Reuters reported that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were sent into refugee camps to intimidate and bribe black African migrant workers into fighting for the Libyan state during the war  Some of these  mercenaries  were compelled to fight against their wishes  according to a source inside one of the refugee camps       In June       Amnesty International said it found no evidence of foreign mercenaries being used  saying the black Africans said to be  mercenaries  were in fact  sub Saharan migrants working in Libya   and described the use of mercenaries as a  myth  that  inflamed public opinion  and led to lynchings and executions of black Africans by rebel forces      Human Rights Watch has countered that while many foreign migrants were erroneously accused of fighting with Gaddafi  there were also genuine mercenaries from several nations who participated in the conflict       In October      it was reported that the South African government was investigating the possibility that Gaddafi hired South African mercenaries to help him escape the besieged city of Sirte  where he was ultimately caught       It is thought that two South African mercenaries died in that operation from a NATO air strike on Gaddafi s convoy  One of the alleged mercenaries speaking from a hospital in North Africa stated that around    South Africans had been contracted by different companies for the operation        Censorship of events edit  A subsidiary of Bull developed a software called Eagle which enabled Gaddafi to monitor internet traffic and which was implemented in Libya in      and with better performance in            Gaddafi shut down all Internet communications in Libya  and arrested Libyans who had given phone interviews to the media            International journalists were banned by the Libyan authorities from reporting from Libya except by invitation of the Gaddafi government                 On    February  The New York Times reported that Gaddafi had tried to impose a blackout on information from Libya       Several residents reported that cellphone service was down  and even landline phone service was sporadic       However  every day new footage made with cell phone cameras found its way to YouTube and the international media  Journalists and human rights researchers made daily phone calls to hundreds of civilians in government held territory  According to RT com  rebels abducted five journalists from Russia in April      in Ajdabiya  they reportedly took away the journalists  documents and equipment before releasing them       In the city of Misrata  rebel leaders imposed restrictions on the foreign media  Journalists were prevented from travelling to the village of Dafniya and were turned back at rebel held checkpoints  Journalists were only able to use officially approved translators       International journalists who attempted to cover the events were attacked by Gaddafi s forces  A BBC News crew was beaten and lined up against a wall by Gaddafi s soldiers  who then shot next to a journalist s ear and laughed at them       A journalist working for The Guardian and another Brazilian journalist have been detained  An Al Jazeera journalist Ali Hassan al Jaber was murdered  and was apparently deliberately targeted       Gaddafi s soldiers held four New York Times journalists   Lynsey Addario  Anthony Shadid  Stephen Farrell and Tyler Hicks   in captivity for a week       Libyan citizen journalist Mohammed Nabbous was shot in the head by Gaddafi s soldiers soon after exposing the Gaddafi government s false reports related to the cease fire declaration        International media edit  After the uprising began  Libyan students studying in the United States allegedly received phone calls from the Libyan embassy  instructing them to join pro Gaddafi rallies  and threatening the loss of their government funded scholarships if they refused  Gaddafi s ambassador denied the reports       A campaign in Serbia has organized people to spread pro Gaddafi messages on the Internet       Gaddafi s aides also organized tours for foreign journalists in Tripoli  The Economist correspondent in Tripoli noted  The picture presented by the regime often falls apart  fast  Coffins at funerals have sometimes turned out to be empty  Bombing sites are recycled  An injured seven year old in a hospital was the victim of a car crash  according to a note passed on surreptitiously by a nurse  Journalists who point out such blatant massaging of facts are harangued in the hotel corridors        The Guardian described journalism in Gaddafi s Libya as  North Korea with palm trees   Journalists were not allowed to go anywhere  or talk to anyone  without authorization from Gaddafi s officials who always followed them  Journalists who did not report events the way Gaddafi s officials instructed faced problems and sudden deportations       In June       Amnesty International criticized  Western media coverage  which  has from the outset presented a very one sided view of the logic of events  portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime s security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge        Human shields edit  Gaddafi forces reportedly surrounded themselves with civilians to protect themselves and key military sites like the Bab al Azizia compound in Tripoli from air strikes       Amnesty International cited claims that Gaddafi had placed his tanks next to civilian facilities  using them as shields       According to Libyan state television  the rebels used human shields in Misrata       The Jamahiriya News Agency reported on a speech delivered by Leader Gaddafi to Misrata tribes in Tripoli  in which he said that the rebels  used children and women as human shields  They took more than     children whose whereabouts we do not know   maybe to Europe  to be evangelised         Domestic responses edit  Main article  Domestic responses to the Libyan

Canadian Air Force  French Air Force  United States Air Force  and British Royal Air Force      undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by the Royal Navy                 From the

rejected the offer  and NATO soon resumed bombardment of Tripoli       In July       Saif al Islam accused NATO of bombing Libyan civilians  including his family members and their children  under the false pretence that their homes were military bases  He also stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal  an offer they rejected  He thus criticized the ICC as  a fake court  that is controlled by the NATO nations                 August rebel offensive edit   A rebel checkpoint in Tripoli on    August      Further information  Battle of

the Gaddafi family were found       Early the following day     August  Gaddafi broadcast an address from a Tripoli local radio station in which he said the withdrawal from Bab al Azizia had been a  tactical  move  The New York Times reported rebel leaders as saying they believed the only areas still under Gaddafi s control  other than the immediate neighbourhood of Bab al Azizia  were al Hadhba and Abu Salim  the latter including the Rixos Hotel where a group of foreign journalists had been trapped for days  However  the report noted the rebels lacked a unified command and that Gaddafi loyalists and snipers remained at large in many areas of Tripoli  Local hospitals and clinics  even in areas considered under rebel control  were reporting hundreds of cases of gunshot wounds and the

Gaddafi  A rebel tank near Ajdabiya Efforts to mop up pro Gaddafi forces in northwestern Libya and toward Sirte began even before the rebels fully consolidated control of Tripoli  Rebels took the city of Ghadames near the borders of Tunisia and Algeria on    August  Members of the Gaddafi family took flight to Algeria  In September  the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid was besieged by rebels  who reported that Gaddafi s son Saif al Islam was hiding in the city       On    September  the NTC captured the southern city of Sabha  and claimed to have found a large cache of chemical weapons       Concerns were raised over the danger of Gaddafi mounting an insurgency against the new authorities       By mid October       much of the city of Sirte had been taken by NTC forces  although fierce fighting continued around the city center  where many pro Gaddafi fighters were encamped       The NTC captured the whole of Sirte on    October       and reported that Gaddafi himself had been killed in the city            Some civilian Gaddafi supporters remaining in the city reported that women and children had been killed in crossfire or fired upon by rebel forces  There were also reports of harassment and theft by rebels  however  the rebel army indicated it would leave unarmed civilians  to their own devices   and had allowed families in the city access to supplies and medical assistance       On   September  when Gaddafi lost his capital Tripoli but continued fighting  the Russian government under president Dmitry Medvedev and prime minister Vladimir Putin recognized the Libyan NTC as the only legal regime in Libya       On   September  Libyan NTC spokesman  Abdulrahman Busin  said the NTC has hard evidence that Gadhafi bought arms from China            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu has confirmed arms sales talks with Gaddafi forces  but no arms were delivered                 On    September  Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao s People s Republic of China government also recognized the NTC of Libya as the only Legal regime in Libya       When China and Russia had abandoned their support of Gaddafi  a spokesman of the NTC of Libya said because of their long time support of Gaddafi  it will be very hard for a Chinese  Russian or Indian oil companies to acquire new exploration contracts        Aftermath edit  Main article  Aftermath of the Libyan civil war See also  Post civil war violence in Libya and Libyan Civil War       present   Libyan rebels have entered the town of Bani Walid Despite the defeat of Gaddafi s loyalists  the capture of his last cities and Gaddafi s death  Saif al Islam  Gaddafi s son and successor  remained hiding in the southern region of Libya until his capture in mid November  In addition  some loyalist forces crossed into Niger  though the escape attempts exploded into violence when detected by Nigerien troops  Sporadic clashes between NTC and former loyalists also continued across Libya with low intensity  On    November       seven people were killed in clashes at Bani Walid  five of them among the revolutionary forces and one Gaddafi loyalist       Fighting broke out on   January       at a building used as intelligence headquarters by the Gaddafi government       Abdul Jalil  the chairman of NTC  warned Libyans that the country could descend into another civil war if they resort to force to settle their differences       It was reported that five people were killed and at least five injured in the events       Also on   January  Libya s government named a retired general from Misrata  Yousel al Manquosh  as head of the country s armed forces       Bani Walid was captured by local tribal fighters on    January  due to the NTC s perceived inability to cooperate with them          The local forces were said to have used heavy weapons and numbered         men      Eight NTC fighters were killed and at least    wounded  with the rest fleeing the city      Clashes were also reported in Benghazi and Tripoli      The NTC has functioned as an interim legislature during the transitional period  In early May       it passed its most sweeping measures to date  granting immunity to former rebel fighters for acts committed during the civil war and ordering that all detainees accused of fighting for Gaddafi should be tried or released by    July       It also adopted Law     prohibiting the publication of  propaganda  criticising the revolution  questioning the authority of Libya s governing organs  or praising Muammar Gaddafi  his family  his government  or the ideas of the Green Book       A September      report by The Independent shows that Libya had plunged into its worst political and economic crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi  The production of oil had almost completely stopped and the government had lost control of large areas of the country to the militias  while violence increased throughout the country       By May       conflicts between several factions in Libya had descended into a second civil war   Impact edit  Casualties edit  Main article  Casualties of the Libyan Civil War  People in Dublin  Ireland  protesting against Gaddafi  March        Independent numbers of dead and injured in the conflict have still not been made available  Estimates have been widely varied  On    February  Libya s ambassador to Malta said that Gaddafi s government believed the number of dead to be about      including civilians  police officers  and soldiers       The exact same day  the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting reported that the International Criminal Court estimated        had been killed       The numbers of injured were estimated to be around       by    February       On   March  the World Health Organization estimated approximately       killed  At the same time  the opposition said that       people had died       Later  rebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga reported that the death toll reached             In June       Amnesty International stated that earlier estimates of the initial clashes in February were exaggerated  It estimated that during the first few days of the conflict      to     people were killed in Benghazi and    to    were killed in Bayda      On   September  Naji Barakat  the Health Minister of the National Transitional Council  stated that about half of an estimated        dead were believed to have been pro Gaddafi fighters  War wounded were estimated as at least         of which about        were serious injuries  but this estimate was expected to rise      However  there was no independent verification of the Health Minister s statement and  one month later  the NTC reduced the estimated number of killed to              In January       the new Libyan government  based on figures still being checked  estimated the number of killed to be actually far lower than previous estimates  with       rebel supporters and a similar number of Gaddafi supporters killed during the conflict  An estimated       people on both sides were missing      Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project  which compiles a database of all reported fatalities due to political violence on the African continent  listed       fatalities from    February to    October       of which       prior to NATO intervention       The Uppsala Conflict Data Program  a public data resource that includes information on different types of organized violence  e g  actors involved  casualties  date  location  etc    reported that between       and       people were killed during the      fighting       In addition their data shows that between     and     civilians were deliberately killed by the pro Gaddafi forces in            There were no combat casualties amongst the coalition forces  although one RAF airman was killed in an accident in Italy   Legal qualification edit   President Barack Obama speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University  Legal qualification of an armed conflict determines which rules of international humanitarian law apply to the conduct of the parties during that conflict  In general  the normative framework applicable to international conflicts is broader and more detailed than the sum of rules that apply in conflicts not of an international character       The qualification of the Libyan conflict is the subject of some academic controversy  While most agree that the intensity of the fighting and the organization of the insurgents quickly rose to the level required for the existence of a non international armed conflict under Common Article   of the      Geneva Conventions            the exact date when these conditions were considered fulfilled ranges from late February      to    March            It is generally accepted that the military intervention by a multi state coalition acting under the Security Council mandate since    March      occasioned an international armed conflict between Libya and the intervening states            Some academics believe that this intervention transformed the legal nature of the conflict as a whole  with the result that even the rebels should have been considered as one of the parties to an overarching international conflict spanning the whole Libyan territory       Others doubt this on account of both legal and factual considerations       Finally  it remains unsettled whether or not the rebels  overthrow of Gaddafi s government following the fall of Tripoli in August      changed the nature of the conflict again  Some academics believe that as the rebels were now the legitimate and effective government of the state of Libya  the conflict was  deinternationalised  and thus non international in nature again            Others maintain the opposite position  arguing that the available legal tests for  deinternationalisation  are unpersuasive and introduce vague and politicized criteria that cannot be satisfactorily considered in the heat of the battle  Consequently  these authors would consider that the international nature of the conflict remained unchanged until the end of hostilities       The ongoing conflict  or conflicts  ended for the purposes of legal qualification with the conclusion of hostilities in Libya in the end of October                  Humanitarian situation edit  Main article  Humanitarian situation during the Libyan Civil War  US forces transport displaced Egyptian workers  March      By the end of February       supplies of medicine  fuel and food were dangerously low in Libya s urban centres       On    February  the International Committee of the Red Cross launched an emergency appeal for US           to meet the emergency needs of people affected by the violent unrest in Libya       In early March  the fighting across Libya meant that more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid            The Islamic Relief and the WFP also coordinated a shipment of humanitarian supplies to Misrata       In March  the Swedish government donated medical supplies and other humanitarian aid and the UN World Food Programme provided food  Turkey sent a hospital ship to Misrata and a Turkish cargo ship brought     tons of humanitarian aid            Another humanitarian issue was refugees fleeing the crisis  A humanitarian ship docked in harbour of Misrata in April to begin the evacuation of stranded migrants       By    July  over         migrants were evacuated       Migrants were also stranded elsewhere in Libya  such as in the southern towns of Sebha and Gatroum  Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road  as many as       refugees were crossing the Libya Tunisia border daily during the first days of the uprising  Among those escaping the violence were native Libyans as well as foreign nationals including Egyptians  Tunisians and Turks       While the UN sanctioned military intervention has been implemented on humanitarian grounds  UN agencies seeking to ease the humanitarian crisis repeatedly rejected offers of support from the military to carry out the agencies  humanitarian operations       The conditions under which such support may be accepted are outlined in the Guidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets to Support United Nations Humanitarian Activities in Complex Emergencies  MCDA   whereby military support can be used but only temporarily and as a last resort       Yet  there remains the concern that aid agencies  neutrality will be brought into question by accepting military support  putting aid staff at risk of being attacked and causing some parties to prevent the agencies accessing all the areas they need to       Furthermore  the military may not always have the technical skills required to assess the need for aid and to ensure its effective distribution       Despite this  offers continue for the creation of an aid corridor and aid agencies have accepted military logistical support in the past  for instance in the      Pakistan floods response        Ethnic targeting edit  In August       the UNHCR issued a strong call for the rights and lives of sub Saharan Africans living in Libya to be protected due to reports that black Africans were being targeted clarification needed  by the rebel forces as cities fell       Other news sources including The Independent and CNN have reported on the targeting clarification needed  of black people in rebel held areas                 An Amnesty International statement  released on    August       stated that on visits to detention centres in Zawiya and Tripoli  Amnesty International was informed that between one third and half of those detained were from Sub Saharan Africa  A New York Times online article also comments that  it seems that plenty of the black Africans captured as mercenaries were never actually involved in the fight              Hundreds of thousands of sub Saharan Africans worked in Gaddafi s Libya  doing everything from managing hotels to sweeping floors  But some also fought as pro Gaddafi mercenaries  and many migrant workers     fled ahead of the rebels  fearing they would be mistaken for mercenaries        It was also reported that some African women had said rebels were raping them in refugee camps  with additional reports of forced labour  Foreign aid workers were also claiming to be prohibited from officially talking about the allegations       The town of Tawergha  which supported Gaddafi prior to its capture by anti Gaddafi fighters in August  has been emptied of its mostly black inhabitants in what appeared to be a  major reprisal against supporters of the Gaddafi regime   according to an    September report from The Sunday Telegraph  and commanders of the Misrata Brigade are refusing to allow the displaced townspeople to return  One commander was quoted as saying   Tawergha no longer exists        In      a former Gaddafi officer reported to the New York Times that the civil war was now an  ethnic struggle  between Arab tribes  like the Zintanis  against those of Turkish ancestry  like the Misuratis   as well as against the Berbers and Circassians        Libyan refugees edit  Main article  Refugees of the Libyan Civil War  Libyan children at a refugee camp  April      Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road  as many as       refugees were crossing the Libya Tunisia border daily during the first days of the uprising  Among those  escaping the violence  were native Libyans as well as foreign nationals including Egyptians  Tunisians and Turks       In February  Italian Foreign Minister Frattini expressed his concerns that the amount of Libyan refugees trying to reach Italy might reach between         and         people       By   March  officials from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had confirmed allegations of discrimination against sub Saharan Africans who were held in dangerous conditions in the no man s land between Tunisia and Libya       By   March  an estimated         refugees had fled Libya to either Tunisia or Egypt  A provisional refugee camp set up at Ras Ajdir with a capacity for        was overflowing with an estimated        to        refugees  Many tens of thousands were still trapped on the Libyan side of the frontier  By   March  the situation was described as a logistical nightmare  with the World Health Organization warning of the risk of epidemics       To continue responding to the needs of people staying at the Ras Ajdir crossing point in Tunisia  the WFP and Secours Islamique France were upgrading a kitchen that would provide breakfast for families  Separately  the ICRC advised it was handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the Tunisian Red Crescent       Since    March  the WFP supplied over        cooked meals for TCNs at the Saloum border  A total of       cartons of fortified date bars  equivalent of      metric tons  had also been provided to supplement these meals       The Sunday Telegraph reported on    September that almost the entire population of Tawergha  a town of about        people  had been forced to flee their homes by anti Gaddafi fighters after their takeover of the settlement  The report suggested that Tawergha  which was dominated by black Libyans  may have been the subject of ethnic cleansing provoked by a combination of racism and bitterness on the part of Misratan fighters over the town s support for Gaddafi during the siege of Misrata        Economic  religious and tribal edit  Oil prices around the world increased during the Libyan conflict  due to the country s significant oil reserves  The Arabian Gulf Oil Company  the second largest state owned oil company in Libya  announced plans to use oil funds to support anti Gaddafi forces       Islamic leaders and clerics in Libya  notably the Network of Free Ulema   Libya urged all Muslims to rebel against Gaddafi       The Tuareg and Magarha tribes announced their support of the protesters            The Zuwayya tribe  based in eastern Libya  threatened to cut off oil exports from fields in its part of Libya if Libyan security forces continued attacking demonstrators        International reactions edit  Main articles  International reactions to the      Libyan Civil War and US domestic reactions to the      military intervention in Libya  A total of    charter flights evacuated Chinese citizens from Libya via Malta       Here a chartered China Eastern Airlines Airbus A    is seen at Malta International Airport on    February       Many states and supranational bodies condemned Gaddafi s government over disputed allegations of air attacks on civilian targets within the country  Virtually all Western countries cut off diplomatic relations with Gaddafi s government over disputed reports of an aerial bombing campaign in February and March  and a number of other countries led by Peru and Botswana did likewise  United Nations Security Council Resolution      was adopted on    February  freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his inner circle and restricting their travel  The resolution also referred the actions of the government to the International Criminal Court for investigation      and an arrest warrant for Gaddafi was issued on    June       This was followed by an arrest warrant issued by Interpol on   September       The disputed allegations about the Libyan government s use of the Libyan Air Force to strike civilians led to the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution      to create a Libyan no fly zone on    March  though several countries involved in the resolution s enforcement have also carried out regular strike missions to degrade the offensive capacity of the Libyan Army and destroy the government s command and control capabilities  effectively acting in de facto support of anti Gaddafi forces on the ground  The later British parliament s Foreign Affairs Select Committee inquiry concluded that by summer      British policy had become one of regime change                 China and Russia  originally abstaining on United Nations Security Council Resolution      due to the influence of the Arab League  pointed out that the implemented  no fly zone  had gone much further out of the originally agreed aims           countries recognized the anti Gaddafi National Transitional Council as Libya s legitimate representative  with many of those countries explicitly describing it as the legal interim government of the country due to the perceived loss of legitimacy on the part of Gaddafi s government  though the National Transitional Council never obtained authority and security across all of Libya       Many states also either issued travel advisories or attempted evacuations  Some evacuations were successful to Malta or via land borders to Egypt or Tunisia  other attempts were hindered by tarmac damage at Benghazi s airport or refusals of permission to land in Tripoli  There were also several solidarity protests in other countries that were mostly composed of Libyan expatriates  Financial markets around the world had adverse reactions to the instability  with oil prices rising to a        year high        See also  Foreign relations of the National Transitional Council See also edit    Libya
