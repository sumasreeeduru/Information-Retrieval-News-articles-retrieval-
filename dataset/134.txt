Jamhuri ya Kenya   is a country in Eastern Africa  At         square kilometres          sq mi   Kenya is the world s   th largest country by total area  With a population of more than      million people  Kenya is the   th most populous country     Kenya s capital and largest city is Nairobi  while its oldest city and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa  Kisumu City is the third largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria  Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret  As of       Kenya is the third largest economy in sub Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa      Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest  Ethiopia to the north  Somalia to the east  Uganda to the west  Tanzania to the south  and the Indian Ocean to the southeast  According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material  the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between       and       BC  a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic  Nilotic speaking pastoralists  ancestral to Kenya s Nilotic speakers  started migrating from present day southern Sudan into Kenya around     BC      European contact began in      with the Portuguese Empire  though effective colonisation of Kenya began in the   th century during the European exploration of the interior  Modern day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in      and the subsequent Kenya Colony  which began in       Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution  which began in       and the subsequent declaration of independence in       After independence  Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations  The current constitution was adopted in      to replace the

version of the modern name was written by German explorer Johann Ludwig Krapf in the   th century  While travelling with a Kamba caravan led by the legendary long distance trader Chief Kivoi  Krapf spotted the mountain peak and asked what it was called  Kivoi told him  K  Nyaa  or  K  ma  K  nyaa   probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded him of the feathers of the male ostrich      The Agikuyu  who inhabit the slopes of Mt  Kenya  call it K r ma K r nyaga in Kikuyu  while the Embu call it  Kirenyaa   All three names have the same meaning      Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia              Some have said that this was a precise notation of the African pronunciation   k nj        An      map drawn by Joseph Thompsons  a Scottish geologist and naturalist  indicated Mt  Kenya as Mt  Kenia      The mountain s name was accepted  pars pro toto  as the name of the country  It did not come into widespread official use during the early colonial period  when the country was referred to as the East African Protectorate  The official name was changed to the Colony of Kenya in        History Main article  History of Kenya Further information  Timeline of Kenya Human Prehistory  The Turkana boy  a     million year old hominid fossil belonging to Homo erectus  Fossils found in Kenya have shown that primates inhabited the area for more than    million years  Recent findings near Lake Turkana indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis      to     million years ago  and Homo erectus      million to         years ago  are possible direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens  and lived in Kenya in the Pleistocene epoch      During excavations at Lake Turkana in       paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey  assisted by Kamoya Kimeu  discovered the Turkana Boy  a     million year old Homo erectus fossil  Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey  who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Olorgesailie and Hyrax Hill  Later work at the former site was undertaken by Glynn Isaac      East Africa  including Kenya  is one of the earliest regions where modern humans  Homo sapiens  are believed to have lived  Evidence was found in       dating to about         years ago  at the Kenyan site of Olorgesailie  of the early emergence of modern behaviours  including  long distance trade networks  involving goods such as obsidian   the use of pigments  and the possible making of projectile points  It is observed by the authors of three      studies on the site  that the evidence of these behaviours is approximately contemporary to the earliest known Homo sapiens fossil remains  such as at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco and Florisbad in South Africa   and they suggest that complex and modern behaviours had already begun in Africa around the time of the emergence of the species Homo sapiens               Neolithic The first inhabitants of present day Kenya were hunter gatherer groups  akin to the modern Khoisan speakers      These people were later largely replaced by agropastoralist Cushitic  ancestral to Kenya s Cushitic speakers  from the Horn of Africa      During the early Holocene  the regional climate shifted from dry to wetter conditions  providing an opportunity for the development of cultural traditions such as agriculture and herding  in a more favourable environment      Around     BC  Nilotic speaking pastoralists  ancestral to Kenya s Nilotic speakers  started migrating from present day southern Sudan into Kenya              Nilotic groups in Kenya include the Kalenjin  Samburu  Luo  Turkana  and Maasai      By the first millennium AD  Bantu speaking farmers had moved into the region  initially along the coast      The Bantus originated in West Africa along the Benue River in what is now eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon      The Bantu migration brought new developments in agriculture and ironworking to the region      Bantu groups in Kenya include the Kikuyu  Luhya  Kamba  Kisii  Meru  Kuria  Aembu  Ambeere  Wadawida Watuweta  Wapokomo  and Mijikenda  among others  Notable prehistoric sites in the interior of Kenya include the  possibly archaeoastronomical  site Namoratunga on the west side of Lake Turkana and the walled settlement of Thimlich Ohinga in Migori County   Swahili trade period Further information  Swahili culture and Sultanate of Zanzibar  A traditional Swahili carved wooden door in Lamu  The Kenyan coast had served host to communities of ironworkers and Bantu subsistence farmers  hunters  and fishers who supported the economy with agriculture  fishing  metal production  and trade with foreign countries  These communities formed the earliest city states in the region  which were collectively known as Azania      By the  st century CE  many of the city states such as Mombasa  Malindi  and Zanzibar began to establish trading relations with Arabs  This led to increased economic growth of the Swahili states  the introduction of Islam  Arabic influences on the Swahili Bantu language  cultural diffusion  as well as the Swahili city states becoming members of a larger trade network          Many historians had long believed that the city states were established by Arab or Persian traders  but archaeological evidence has led scholars to recognise the city states as an indigenous development which  though subjected to foreign influence due to trade  retained a Bantu cultural core      The Kilwa Sultanate was a medieval sultanate centred at Kilwa  in modern day Tanzania  At its height  its authority stretched over the entire length of the Swahili Coast  including Kenya  It was said to be founded in the   th century by Ali ibn al Hassan Shirazi      a Persian Sultan from Shiraz in southern Iran      However  scholars have suggested that claims of Arab or Persian origin of city states were attempts by the Swahili to legitimise themselves both locally and internationally          Since the   th century  rulers of Kilwa would go on to build elaborate coral mosques and introduce copper coinage      Swahili  a Bantu language with Arabic  Persian  and other Middle Eastern and South Asian loanwords  later developed as a lingua franca for trade between the different peoples      Swahili now also has loanwords from English   Early Portuguese colonization  Portuguese presence in Kenya lasted from      until       Mombasa was under Portuguese rule from      to      and again from      to       The Swahili built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city states  as well as commercial centres in Persia  Arabia  and even India      By the   th century  Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa claimed that  Mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships  both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar       Later on in the   th century  the Swahili coast was conquered and came under direct rule of Omani Arabs  who expanded the slave trade to meet the demands of plantations in Oman and Zanzibar      Initially  these traders came mainly from Oman  but later many came from Zanzibar  such as Tippu Tip        In addition  the Portuguese started buying slaves from the Omani and Zanzibari traders in response to the interruption of the transatlantic slave trade by British abolitionists  Throughout the centuries  the Kenyan coast has played host to many merchants and explorers  Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi  It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the   th century and once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the African Great Lakes region  Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers  In       the Chinese trader and explorer Zheng He  representing the Ming Dynasty  visited the East African coast on one of his last  treasure voyages        Malindi authorities also welcomed the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in        British Kenya             Main article  Kenya Colony  British East Africa in      The colonial history of Kenya dates from the establishment of a German protectorate over the Sultan of Zanzibar s coastal possessions in       followed by the arrival of the Imperial British East Africa Company in       Imperial rivalry was prevented when Germany handed its coastal holdings to Britain in       This was followed by the building of the Uganda Railway passing through the country      The building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groups notably the Nandi  led by Orkoiyot Koitalel Arap Samoei for ten years from      to      however the British eventually built the railway  The Nandi were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway      During the railway construction era  there was a significant influx of Indian workers  who provided the bulk of the skilled manpower required for construction      They and most of their descendants later remained in Kenya and formed the core of several distinct Indian communities such as the Ismaili Muslim and Sikh communities      While building the railway through Tsavo  a number of the Indian railway workers and local African labourers were attacked by two lions known as the Tsavo maneaters      At the outbreak of World War I in August       the governors of British East Africa  as the protectorate was generally known  and German East Africa initially agreed on a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities  Lt  Col  Paul von Lettow Vorbeck took command of the German military forces  determined to tie down as many British resources as possible  Completely cut off from Germany  von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign  living off the land  capturing British supplies  and remaining undefeated  He eventually surrendered in Northern Rhodesia  today Zambia  fourteen days after the Armistice was signed in             The Kenya Uganda Railway near Mombasa  about       To chase von Lettow  the British deployed the British Indian Army troops from India but needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot  The Carrier Corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over         Africans  contributing to their long term politicisation      In       the East Africa Protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed Kenya after its highest mountain      During the early part of the   th century  the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers  who became wealthy farming coffee and tea       one depiction of this period of change from one colonist s perspective is found in the memoir Out of Africa by Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen Finecke  published in        By the     s  approximately        white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy      The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people  most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers  To protect their interests  the settlers banned the growing of coffee  introduced a hut tax  and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour  A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled      By the     s  there were        white settlers living in Kenya       Throughout World War II  Kenya was an important source of manpower and agriculture for the United Kingdom  Kenya itself was the site of fighting between Allied forces and Italian troops in          when Italian forces invaded  Wajir and Malindi were bombed as well  In       Princess Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip were on holiday at the Treetops Hotel in Kenya when her father  King George VI  died in his sleep  The young princess cut short her trip and returned home immediately to assume the throne  She was crowned Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in      and as British hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett  who accompanied the royal couple  put it  she went up a tree in Africa a princess and came down a queen       Mau Mau Uprising Further information  Mau Mau Uprising  A statue of Dedan Kimathi  a Kenyan rebel leader with the Mau Mau who fought against the British colonial system in the     s  From October      to December       Kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the Mau Mau rebellion against British rule  The Mau Mau  also known as the Kenya Land and Freedom Army  were primarily members of the Kikuyu ethnic group  citation needed  The governor requested and obtained British and African troops  including the King s African Rifles  The British began counter insurgency operations  In May       General Sir George Erskine took charge as commander in chief of the colony s armed forces  with the personal backing of Winston Churchill      The capture of Waruhiu Itote  nom de guerre  General China   on    January      and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure for the British  Operation Anvil opened on    April       after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council  The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege  Nairobi s occupants were screened and the suspected Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps  More than        members of the Kikuyu ethnic group were held in detention camps without trial  often subject to brutal treatment      The Home Guard formed the core of the government s strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans  not foreign forces such as the British Army and King s African Rifles  By the end of the emergency  the Home Guard had killed       Mau Mau  amounting to     of the total insurgents   The capture of Dedan Kimathi on    October      in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive      During this period  substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred  The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan  which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau   Somalis of Kenya referendum       Further information  Somalis in Kenya Before Kenya got its independence  Somali ethnic people in the present day Kenya in the areas of Northern Frontier Districts petitioned Her Majesty s Government not to be included in Kenya  The colonial government decided to hold Kenya s first referendum in      to check the willingness of Somalis in Kenya to join Somalia     The result of the referendum showed that     of Somalis in Kenya wanted to join Somalia  but the British colonial administration rejected the result and the Somalis remained in Kenya           Independence  The first president and founding father of Kenya  Jomo Kenyatta  The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in       Despite British hopes of handing power to  moderate  local rivals  it was the Kenya African National Union  KANU  of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government  The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on    December       with independence being conferred on all of Kenya  The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya  The Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the colony  the sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would become one sovereign state          In this way  Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act      of the United Kingdom  Exactly    months later on    December       Kenya became a republic under the name  Republic of Kenya       Concurrently  the Kenyan army fought the Shifta War against ethnic Somali rebels inhabiting the Northern Frontier District who wanted to join their kin in the Somali Republic to the north      A ceasefire was eventually reached with the signature of the Arusha Memorandum in October       but relative insecurity prevailed through               To discourage further invasions  Kenya signed a defence pact with Ethiopia in       which is still in effect       The first president of Kenya Further information  Presidency of Jomo Kenyatta and Jomo Kenyatta On    December       the Republic of Kenya was proclaimed  and Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya s first president      Under Kenyatta  corruption became widespread throughout the government  civil service  and business community  Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after       Their acquisitions in the Central  Rift Valley  and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans  His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property  The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business  with Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel      President Jomo Kenyatta s mixed legacy was highlighted at the    year anniversary of Kenya s independence  An article published in the New York Times in December of      praised Kenyatta s leadership and Kenya for emerging as a model of pragmatism and conservatism  Kenya s GDP had increased at a rate of     per cent a year  higher than the population growth rate of more than   per cent       However  Amnesty International responded to this article by stating the cost of the stability in terms of human rights abuses  The opposition party started by Oginga Odinga   Kenya People s Union  KPU    was banned in      following the Kisumu Massacre and KPU leaders were still in detention without trial in gross violation of the U N  Declaration of Human Rights          The Kenya Students Union  Jehovah Witnesses and all opposition parties were outlawed      Kenyatta ruled until his death on    August            Moi era  Daniel arap Moi  Kenya s second President  and George W  Bush       Further

 elections were held a year early  and were a direct result of a failed military coup on   August       The      coup was masterminded by a low ranking Air Force serviceman  Senior Private Hezekiah Ochuka  and was staged mainly by enlisted men of the Air Force  It was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff Mahamoud Mohamed  a veteran Somali military official      They included the General Service Unit  GSU  a paramilitary wing of the police and later the regular police  On the heels of the Garissa Massacre of       Kenyan troops committed the Wagalla massacre in      against thousands of civilians in Wajir County  An official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in           clarification needed  The election held in      saw the advent of the mlolongo  queuing  system  where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of casting a secret ballot      This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform  Several contentious clauses  including the one that allowed for only one political party  were changed in the following years       Transition to multiparty democracy In       Kenya transitioned to a multiparty political system after    years of single party rule  On    October       president Moi dissolved parliament  five months before the end of his term  As a result  preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president  The elections were scheduled to take place on   December       but delays led to its postponement to    December the same year  Apart from KANU  the ruling party  other parties represented in the elections included FORD Kenya and FORD Asili  This election was marked by large scale intimidation of opponents  as well as harassment of election officials  It resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to retain power              This election was a turning point for Kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of Moi s leadership and the rule of KANU  Moi retained the presidency and George Saitoti

rule by KANU      Following skirmishes in the aftermath of the elections        people were killed and a further        others displaced from their homes      In the next five years  many political alliances were formed in preparation for the next elections  In       Jaramogi Oginga Odinga died and several coalitions joined his FORD Kenya party to form a new party called United National Democratic Alliance  However  this party was plagued with disagreements  In       Richard Leakey formed the Safina party  but it was denied registration until November           In       KANU revised the constitution to allow Moi to remain president for another term  Subsequently  Moi stood for re election and won a  th term in           His win was strongly criticised by his major opponents  Kibaki and Odinga  as being fraudulent          Following this win  Moi was constitutionally barred from vying for another presidential term  Beginning in       Moi attempted to influence the country

Coalition   NARC   was elected president  David Anderson        reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers  and seemed to mark a turning point in Kenya s democratic evolution      In       Kenyans rejected a plan to replace the      independence constitution with a new one      As a result  the elections of      took place following the procedure set by the old constitution  Kibaki was re elected in highly contested elections marred by political and ethnic violence  The main opposition leader  Raila Odinga  claimed that the election results were rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president  In the ensuing violence        people were killed and another         were internally displaced  making it the worst post election violence in Kenya  To stop the death and displacement of people  Kibaki and Odinga agreed to work together  with the latter taking the position of a prime minister      This made Odinga the second prime minister of Kenya  In July       Kenya partnered with other East African countries to form the new East African Common Market within the East African Community      In August       Kenyans held a referendum and passed a new constitution  which limited presidential powers and devolved the central government       Devolution of government and separation of powers Further information  Administrative divisions of Kenya  Constitution of Kenya  and Presidency of Uhuru Kenyatta Following the passage of the new constitution  Kenya became a presidential representative democratic republic  whereby the President of Kenya is both head of state and head of government  and of a multi party system  The new constitution also states that executive powers are exercised by the executive branch of government  headed by the president  who chairs the cabinet that is composed of people chosen from outside parliament  Legislative power is vested exclusively in Parliament  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  Mwai Kibaki became the first president to serve under this new constitution while Uhuru Kenyatta became the first president elected under this constitution  In       Kenya began sending troops to Somalia to fight the Islamic terror group Al Shabaab        Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta with U S  Secretary of State John Kerry     August      In mid       two consecutive missed rainy seasons precipitated the worst drought in East Africa seen in    years  The northwestern Turkana region was especially affected      with local schools shut down as a result      The crisis was reportedly over by early      because of coordinated relief efforts  Aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery initiatives  including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds      In       Kenya held its first general elections after the new constitution had been passed  Uhuru Kenyatta won in a disputed election result  leading to a petition by the opposition leader  Raila Odinga  The supreme court upheld the election results and President Kenyatta began his term with William Ruto as the deputy president  Despite the outcome of this ruling  the

term in office in another disputed election  Following the defeat  Raila Odinga again petitioned the results in the Supreme Court  accusing the electoral commission of mismanagement of the elections and Uhuru Kenyatta and his party of rigging  The Supreme Court overturned the election results in what became a landmark ruling in Africa and one of the very few in the world in which the results of a presidential elections were annulled      This ruling solidified the position of the Supreme Court as an independent body      Consequently  Kenya had a second round of elections for the presidential

Kenya s climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate inland to arid in the north and northeast parts of the country  The area receives a great deal of sunshine every month  It is usually cool at night and early in the morning inland at higher elevations  The  long rains  season occurs from March April to May June  The  short rains  season occurs from October to November December  The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and evenings  Climate change is altering the natural pattern of the rainfall period  causing an extension of the short rains  which has begat floods       and reducing the drought cycle from every ten years to annual events  producing strong droughts such as the         Kenya Drought        The temperature remains high throughout these months of tropical rain  The hottest period is February and March  leading into the season of the long rains  and the coldest is in July  until mid August         Kenya map of K ppen climate classification  Climate change in Kenya is increasingly impacting the lives of Kenya s citizens and the environment       Climate change has led to more frequent extreme weather events like droughts which last longer than usual  irregular and unpredictable rainfall  flooding and increasing temperatures  The effects of all these climatic changes have made worse already existing challenges with  water security  economic growth  food security as a result of decreasing harvests and agricultural production which accounts for about          of total Gross Domestic Product  GDP        The increased temperatures  rainfall variability in arid and semi arid areas  and strong winds associated with tropical cyclones have combined to create favorable conditions for pest breeding  development and migration       For instance  in early      some parts     of not only Kenya  but also neighboring East African Countries faced massive swarms of locust invasions       Even if attributing infestation to climate change is difficult  climate change is known to be capable of changing the feeding and outbreak dynamics of some insect species       The effects of changing weather patterns to pest climate projections suggest an increase in temperature of up to     C between      and       and an increasing frequency of extreme events  such as floods and droughts        Kenya s Arid and

national parliament       In December       Kenya held democratic and open elections  which were judged free and fair by most international observers       The      elections marked an important turning point in Kenya s democratic evolution in that power was transferred peacefully from the Kenya African National Union  KANU   which had ruled the country since independence  to the National Rainbow Coalition  NARC   a coalition of political parties  Under the presidency of Mwai Kibaki  the new ruling coalition promised to focus its efforts on generating economic growth  combating corruption  improving education  and rewriting its constitution  A few of these promises have been met  There is free primary education       In       the government issued a statement declaring that

well        Nevertheless  there have been serious allegations of human rights violations  most recently while conducting counter insurgency operations in the Mt Elgon area      and also in the district of Mandera central       Kenya s armed forces  like many government institutions in the country  have been tainted by corruption allegations  Because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of  state security   the corruption has been hidden from public view  and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety  This has changed recently  In what are by Kenyan standards unprecedented revelations  in       credible claims of corruption were made with regard to recruitment      and procurement of armoured personnel carriers       Further  the wisdom and prudence of certain decisions of procurement have been publicly questioned        Administrative divisions Main articles  Counties of Kenya and Divisions of Kenya  Kenya s    counties  Kenya is divided into    semi autonomous counties that are headed by governors  These    counties form the first order divisions of Kenya  The smallest administrative units in Kenya are called locations  Locations often coincide with electoral wards  Locations are usually named after their central villages towns  Many larger towns consist of several locations  Each location has a chief  appointed by the state  Constituencies are an electoral subdivision  with each county comprising a whole number of constituencies  An interim boundaries commission was formed in      to review

Kenya  A proportional representation of Kenya s exports  Kenya s macroeconomic outlook has steadily posted robust growth over the past few decades  mostly from road and rail infrastructure projects  However  much of this growth has come from cash flows diverted from ordinary Kenyan pockets at the microeconomic level through targeted monetary and fiscal measures coupled with poor management  corruption  massive theft of public funds  overlegislation  and an ineffective judiciary  resulting in diminished incomes in ordinary households and small businesses  unemployment  underemployment  and general discontent across multiple sectors  Kenya ranks poorly on the Fragile States Index at number    out of     countries  ranked in       and is placed in the ALERT category  In       the

including forestry and fishing  accounted for     of GDP  as well as for     of wage employment and     of revenue from exports  The principal cash crops are tea  horticultural produce  and coffee  Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya s exports  The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather related fluctuations  Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid for example in       due to one of Kenya s intermittent droughts       A consortium led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics  ICRISAT  has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties instead of maize  in particularly dry areas  Pigeon peas are very drought resistant  so can be grown in areas with less than     mm annual rainfall  Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro dealer networks for distribution and marketing  This work  which included linking producers to wholesalers  helped to increase local producer prices by        in Nairobi and Mombasa  The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock  and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty       Tea  coffee  sisal

can guarantee food security  and coupled with resulting poverty      of the population lives below the poverty line   a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid       Poor roads  an inadequate railway network  under used water transport  and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi arid areas  and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets  This was last seen in August and September       prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross         Agricultural countryside in Kenya Kenya s irrigation sector is categorised into three organizational types  smallholder schemes  centrally managed public schemes  and private commercial irrigation schemes  The smallholder schemes are owned  developed  and managed by individuals or groups of farmers operating as water users or self help groups  Irrigation is carried out on individual or on group farms averaging         ha  There are about       smallholder irrigation schemes covering a total area of        ha  The country has seven large  centrally managed irrigation schemes  namely Mwea  Bura
