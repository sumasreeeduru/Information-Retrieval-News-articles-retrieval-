genealogical research initiated by his mother suggested they might have descended from the Italian patrician Della Torre dynasty  also known as Torriano   Based on this research  the Taxis family wanted to change their name to  Tour and Taxis    Already in the first documents he signed in       he called himself Lamoral Claudius Franci cus de la Tour  Count of Taxis  although his name change was not approved by the emperor until       Following up on his mother s initiative  he commissioned the genealogist Engelbert Flacchie in      to write a book on the dynastic history of the house of

Postmaster General edit  On   December       Lamoral Claudius was granted an imperial patent  which entitled him to set up post stations anywhere in the Holy Roman Empire  The operation of the

and in particular during the peace negotiations in M nster and Osnabr ck  the Protestant rulers had put some effort in setting up an independent postal system using the relay system  In theory  the Imperial postal system held a legal monopoly  which had been granted by Emperor Rudolph II in        However  the Protestant rulers argued that the Habsburg Archdukes operated their own independent  Court Post  system  which had been recognized by Lamoral Claudius Franz s grandfather Lamoral of Taxis  After the Peace of Westphalia  some powerful Protestant rulers  such as the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony  the Landgraves of Hesse Kassel and the Dukes of Brunswick L neburg  began setting up independent postal systems in their territories      Lamoral II Claudius Franz  the Imperial Postmaster General  tried in vain to conter this development  At a conference of Protestant rulers in Hildesheim in       the rulers decided to a common approach towards the claims of the House of Taxis  Lamoral II Claudius Franz again argued that their postal systems were illegal under Rudolph s monopoly decree from       However  he did not prevail and after lengthy negotiations  he had to accept the existence of competitors and he lost several postal routes to these new competitors  During another conference on postal issues in       again in Hildesheim  a definitive demarcation
