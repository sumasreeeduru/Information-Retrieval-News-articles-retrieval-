opinion that surrounds the Qatar television news network Al Jazeera  Throughout the film  US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld appears at press conferences  complaining about the propagandist nature of Al Jazeera  Paradoxically  another clip shows Muhammad Saeed al Sahhaf  the Iraqi Minister of Information  accusing the television organization of transmitting American propaganda  The contrasting views between the documentary s central figures are not so clear cut  Early in the movie  press officer Lt  Rushing remarks that Al Jazeera s bias leads it to focus exclusively on American tanks and Iraqi casualties  yet he later confides that agencies such as Fox News also appear to hand pick their material  and he sees what both sides leave out  Samir Khader  a senior producer of Al Jazeera  claims the network s purpose is to shake up the rigid infrastructure of Arab society  which he believes has fallen behind  culturally and technologically  because of its social intolerance to other cultures and perspectives   Bias in the media edit  Rushing laments about Al Jazeera s bias  and speculates why the network shows no photos of alleged Iraqi military atrocities  such as soldiers holding families hostage  Abdallah Schleifer  an American reporter  counters that no such pictures exist  He has no doubt these atrocities occur  However  he explains that hearsay filtering down through CentCom is not convincing to skeptical Arab viewers   That s why pictures of these things are so vital   A crucial point in the documentary comes with Lt  Rushing s realization that Fox News displays that same lack of objectivity which he accuses Al Jazeera of perpetuating   his conclusion drives home the point that media bias is institutionalized on both sides  Given the subject of this film  pictures are so important because they transcend language  Unless there is concern that they have been contrived  they give useful information to all perspectives  This is what a producer for Al Jazeera claims was the motivation for showing dead American soldiers and Iraqi civilians  As for objectivity  she discards it as  a mirage   The film concludes that war is something that makes emotionless involvement impossible for any involved party   Journalist embedding during Iraq War edit  In an effort to rectify past mishandling of media personnel during wartime and to garner support for the Iraq war  the Pentagon introduced a new journalist embedding policy  The policy allowed media  long term  minimally restrictive access to U S  air  ground and naval forces through embedding   In its implementation of the policy  the Pentagon expressed recognition of the media s ability to  shape public perception of the national security environment now and in the years ahead  for the U S  public  the public in allied countries whose opinion can affect the durability of  the  coalition   As many as     journalists covered the Iraq War as embedded journalists at the start of the Iraq War  meaning that in addition to reporting on military action in Iraq  the journalists were also required to  live  work  and travel as part of the units    The media embed ground rules introduced in March      stated   Our ultimate strategic success in bringing peace and security to this region will come in our long term commitment to supporting our democratic ideals  We need to tell the factual story good or bad  before others seed the media with disinformation and distortions    Victoria Clarke  Pentagon spokesperson    Freedom of the media edit  One of the central focuses of Control Room is on the alleged friendly fire attack against the Baghdad headquarters of Al Jazeera  on   April       The film shows footage of the attack  and film reports that the alleged target was a group of insurgents who opened fire on coalition forces from within the Al Jazeera building  thus justifying retaliatory fire  Much doubt is expressed within as to whether such an explanation is viable  During the attack  one correspondent working for the news network  Tarek Ayyoub  was killed  the film records one subsequent episode during a press conference  when Ayyoub s widow beseeches journalists to  tell the truth  concerning her husband s death  for the sake of those innocents already killed during the war  The same day that witnessed the attacks on Al Jazeera also saw attacks on other news networks  a strike by US troops on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad killed a Spanish TV cameraman and a Reuters cameraman  Claims that US troops were returning fire upon a sniper were  greeted with incredulity by reporters on the ground  including Sky News reporter David Chater  and at Central Command in Qatar      On the same day  Abu Dhabi TV was also hit   which means the US forces  had  attacked all the main western and Arab media headquarters in the space of just one day      Charter also said that   Al Jazeera is the best Channel in the world   citation needed  The aftermath of the attack saw a number of allegations  Al Jazeera claimed to have sent the Pentagon details of their staff s position via GPS co ordinates  as did several other news networks  At the time  sources from the BBC noted with alarm that  the Pentagon did not seem to pay heed to information they had been given by Al Jazeera and every other TV organization based in  Baghdad       The overwhelming majority of opinion amongst the Arabic media seems to be that the US acted in order to prevent the reporting of war crimes perpetrated by American personnel     the attack on Al Jazeera was thus deliberate  a theory which seems to have support from Robert Fisk        In Control Room  the situation is remarked upon by a senior member of Al Jazeera  who remarks that a small news network cannot hope to combat the forces of the United States  in the face of such an apparent censure by so mighty an opponent  he laments  what may one do but  shut up    Gaining access to Al Jazeera edit  When director  Jehane Noujaim  and cinematographer  Hani Salama s  initial attempts to contact and gain access to Al Jazeera failed  Noujaim  without much funding or equipment  traveled to Doha  Qatar  the headquarters for both Al Jazeera and the United States  Central Command  After weeks waiting for approval in Al Jazeera s guard office  the filmmakers finally received an audience with Al Jazeera s General Manager  Mohammad Jassem through Abdallah Schleifer  one of Salama s professors from the American University in Cairo       Noujaim was initially only given permission to film for three days  After the three days were up  however  Noujaim notes that she begged to continue shooting  and she was allowed to stay longer      Although unable to provide much support  personally  Jassem suggested that Noujaim and Salama search Al Jazeera s cafeteria for anyone that they might want to follow  There  Noujaim and Salama discovered both Samir Khader and Hassan Ibrahim  not only central characters to the film but also crucial to gaining the crew access into Al Jazeera  Noujaim explains   We also met Hassan in the cafeteria over many cups of coffee and many cigarettes  and he was really the person that was responsible for getting us such amazing access to Al Jazeera  I think he was the first person that believed in what we were doing  And he went to the General Manager and said  Look  I ll take of them  They won t get into the way  They ll just be following me around    Noujaim  Audio Commentary   Noujaim and Salama often recorded footage simultaneously  capturing multiple angles or locations for the same moment using the Sony DCR VX     and Sony DSR PD    miniDV cameras      Despite having a small production  the lack of lighting or formal setup  granted extra flexibility  allowing Noujaim to follow the pace of the Al Jazeera newsroom and focus more on her subjects  Noujaim explains   Sometimes it s a good thing to walk around with a broomstick as a boom and your camera half broken  Y know  look like a very low budget  non threatening production  and be small   Noujaim  Audio Commentary    Production edit  Control Room  was originally to be funded by the BBC  but Noujaim s plan of documenting Al Jazeera covering the war was passed along to BBC director Ben Anthony  who later produced Al Jazeera Exclusive  One of the reasons Noujaim s film is titled Control Room is that Anthony got exclusive access to the newsroom  which left her to shoot elsewhere  including the control room      Noujaim says she wanted to be at the center of news creation and make a film on the broader perceptions of the war  a reason why she headed to  Al Jazeera  s headquarters in Doha  which was barely    miles away from the Central Command  the military base of the United States  Before leaving for Cairo  when Noujaim called her agents in Hollywood  she was told this was the worst idea ever  since after      people did not want to watch war  but things that were comforting to them        Noujaim had raised  US       for the film and says she did the film  as cheaply as she could   She rented an inexpensive Pakistani hotel in Doha and called upon her cinematographer friend Hani Salama to join the project  They both carried their own cameras  Noujaim with a Sony VX     and Salama with a Sony PD        Noujaim was only in the Middle East for    days to complete filming for Control Room       From the     hour footage that was filmed  Noujaim says initially they had six characters  but then decided to review the footage chronologically  picked out the best scenes and characters  and tried to weave each narrative together  Noujaim wanted to  convey surprise  confusion  discovery    reproduce her own process in making the film   Four editors of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds volunteered their time for six months to complete editing of the film  Payback for everyone involved in the film depended on how well the documentary was received      Noujaim says she edited her movie both in Egypt and in the US  as the contrast between the worlds became central to her understanding of the war       Cin ma v rit  genre edit  Control Room is a Cin ma v rit  film which attempts to present an un narrated behind the scenes focus on the functioning of Al Jazeera and of the US Central Command during the Iraq War   The film  in its style  recalls The War Room  a cinema v rit  documentary by Noujaim s mentors Chris Hegedus and D  A  Pennebaker  which had a similar behind the scene focus on media spinning during Bill Clinton s campaign of            Release edit  Control Room premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January               Shortly after  the film was acquired by Magnolia Pictures      Magnolia stated  Control Room wasn t extreme in filmmaking  but the sort of effect it had on viewers was extreme  People were conditioned in the US to think that Al Jazeera were rabid  American hating  and will do anything to plant a bomb  But they were reasonable journalists  We rushed the film for release  taking dates  making posters even before the contract had been signed       It was released on May                Reception edit  Critical reception edit  Control Room received positive reviews from film critics  It holds a     approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes  based on     reviews  with a weighted average of              On Metacritic  the film holds a rating of    out of      based on    critics  indicating  generally favorable reviews        Controversies and criticism edit  Control Room has been criticized for partisanship and bias  The film is accused of partisan portrayal where  the Al Jazeera reporters and characters are shown as stronger characters  while the American reporters she chooses are framed as a motley lot  who are seen shallow  or cynical  or inappropriate as they re seen laughing  challenging  doubting  mocking       Questions have also been raised on the sequence where Al Jazeera s cameraperson Tariq Ayoob is killed by a US A   aircraft circling overhead  Critics have questioned whether it was really a US aircraft that fired the missile  which Noujaim shows  or the sequence of footage was being rearranged and shots from a completely different incident were used to make a completely different point        Noujaim has defended the criticism of objectivity and treatment by stating  I am not saying it is the truth  but it is our truth        Special features edit  The special features that accompany the DVD contain further interviews     In one  Hassan Ibrahim states his belief that Bush s actions are just as much terrorism as Bin Laden s  and that any use of violence is terrorism   The unidentified person speaking with Ibrahim retorts  So there is no such thing as terrorism    Ibrahim goes on to refute the word  terrorism  as a term that is unjustly applied only to Arabs  and unthinkingly adopted by the US media and public  In another segment Dima Khatib states that her personal views do not colour what Al Jazeera presents  because  Al Jazeera just presents information    The film further notes that both the Bush administration and radical groups in Iraq  such as elements of Saddam s fallen regime  distrust and dislike Al Jazeera s information  See also edit  Axis of Evil  film  Baghdad or Bust Kill the Messenger       film  My Country
