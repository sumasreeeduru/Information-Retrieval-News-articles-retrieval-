reporter as part of the story using a first person narrative  The word  gonzo  is believed to have been first used in      to describe an article about the Kentucky Derby by Hunter S  Thompson  who popularized the style  It is an energetic first person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist  and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self satire     It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors  Gonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions  in contrast to traditional journalism  which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties  Gonzo journalism disregards the strictly edited product favored by newspaper media and strives for a more personal approach  the personality of a piece is as important as the event or actual subject of the piece  Use of sarcasm  humor  exaggeration  and profanity is common  Thompson  who was among the forefathers of the new journalism movement  said in the February           issue of Rolling Stone   If I d written the truth I knew for the past ten years  about     people including me would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today  Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism       Contents    Origin of the term   Hunter S  Thompson   Influence   See also   References   Sources   External links   Origin of the term edit       Gonzo        song by James Booker   Problems playing this file  See media help   The term  gonzo  was first used in connection with Hunter S  Thompson by The Boston Globe magazine editor Bill Cardoso in       He described Thompson s article  The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved   which was written for the June      edition of Scanlan s Monthly  as  pure Gonzo journalism      Cardoso claimed that  gonzo  was South Boston Irish slang describing the last man standing after an all night drinking marathon     He also claimed that it was a corruption of the French Canadian word  gonzeaux   which means  shining path   although this is disputed     Another speculation is that the word may have been inspired by the      hit song  Gonzo  by New Orleans rhythm and blues pianist James Booker  This possibility is supported by a      oral biography of Thompson  which states that the term is taken from a song by Booker    but does not explain why Thompson or Cardoso would have chosen the term to describe Thompson s journalism  The      documentary Bayou Maharaja  The Tragic Genius of James Booker    quotes Thompson s literary executor as saying that the song was the origin of the term     According to a Greg Johnson biographical note on Booker     the song title  Gonzo  comes from a character in a movie called The Pusher      which in turn may have been inspired by a      Evan Hunter novel of the same title  Thompson himself first used the term referring to his own work on page    of the counterculture classic     Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  He wrote   But what was the story  Nobody had bothered to say  So we would have to drum it up on our own  Free Enterprise  The American Dream  Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas  Do it now  pure Gonzo journalism       Lexico proposes etymology from Italian  gonzo  simpleton  dolt  and or Spanish  ganso  dolt  goose        Hunter S  Thompson edit  Thompson based his style on William Faulkner s notion that  fiction is often the best fact       While the things that Thompson wrote about are basically true  he used satirical devices to drive his points home  He often wrote about recreational drugs and alcohol use  which added subjective flair to his reporting  The term  gonzo  has also come into  sometimes pejorative  use to describe journalism in Thompson s style  characterized by a drug fueled stream of consciousness writing technique  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas followed the Mint     piece in      and included a main character by the name of Raoul Duke  accompanied by his attorney  Dr  Gonzo  with defining art by Ralph Steadman  Although this book is considered a prime example of gonzo journalism  Thompson regarded it as a failed experiment      He had intended it to be an unedited record of everything he did as it happened  but he edited the book five times before publication  Thompson would instigate events himself  often in a prankish or belligerent manner  and then document both his actions and those of others  Notoriously neglectful of deadlines  Thompson often annoyed his editors because he submitted articles late   too late to be edited  yet still in time for the printer       Thompson wanted his work to be read as he wrote it  in its  true Gonzo  form  Historian Douglas Brinkley said gonzo journalism requires virtually no rewriting and frequently uses transcribed interviews and verbatim telephone conversations       I don t get any satisfaction out of the old traditional journalist s view   I just covered the story  I just gave it a balanced view    Thompson said in an interview for the online edition of The Atlantic   Objective journalism is one of the main reasons American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long  You can t be objective about Nixon        Influence edit  Thompson felt that objectivity in journalism was a myth  Gonzo journalism has now become a bona fide style of writing that concerns itself with  telling it like it is   similar to the New Journalism of the     s  led primarily by Tom Wolfe and also championed by Lester Bangs  George Plimpton  Terry Southern  and John Birmingham  and is considered a subgenre citation needed  of New Journalism  When asked whether there was a difference between the two  Thompson answered   Yeah  I think so  Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese  for instance  I almost never try to reconstruct a story  They re both much better reporters than I am  but then I don t really think of myself as a reporter       In       Christopher Locke asserted that the webzine genre is descended from gonzo journalism      a claim that has since been extended to social media      Thompson s gonzo journalism influence is reflected in the current website Gonzo Today which features a top banner by Thompson s longtime illustrator Ralph Steadman  with rotating contributions by others including Thompson associate  poet Ron Whitehead   See also edit  Citizen journalism Creative nonfiction Embedded journalism Gonzo pornography Immersion
