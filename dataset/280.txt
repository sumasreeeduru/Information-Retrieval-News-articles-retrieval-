Somalia  The city has served as an important port connecting with traders all round the Indian Ocean for millennia and currently has a population of           residents     Mogadishu is the nearest foreign mainland city to Seychelles  at a distance of     mi        km  over the Indian Ocean     Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banadir region on the Indian Ocean  which unlike other Somali regions  is considered a municipality rather than a maamulgoboleed  federal state      Mogadishu has a long history  which ranges from the ancient period up until the present  serving as the capital of an influential Sultanate in the  th century  which for centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade  and eventually came under the Ajuran Empire in the   th century  which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade  Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the   th and   th centuries      and was during the early modern period considered the richest city on the East African coast  as well as the center of a thriving textile industry      In the   th century  Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and then came under the direct rule of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi  The onset of Italian colonialism occurred in incremental stages  with Italian treaties in the     s followed by economic engagement between various Somali clans  including the Reer Mataan and the Shaansi  Cadcad  clans like reer Xamar and the Italian Benadir Company and then direct governance by the Italian government after      and the British Military Administration of Somalia after World War Two and the UN Italian Trust Territory in the     s  This was followed by independence in       the Hantiwadaag  socialist  era during Barre

Mogadishu  Muqdisho  has many theories but it is most likely derived from a morphology of the Somali words  Muuq  and  Disho  which literally means  Sight Killer  or  Blinder  possibly referring to the city s blinding beauty      Other theories suggest the Persian word Maq ad i Sh h             which means  the seat of the Shah       and another theory is that it is derived from the Arabic root  mqds   which means  hallowed  place    but the place is far too ancient  The   th century explorer Leo Africanus knew the city as Magadazo  alt  Magadoxo        History edit  Antiquity edit  Main articles  Sarapion  History of Mogadishu  and Maritime history of Somalia  Engraving of the   th century Fakr ad Din Mosque built by Fakr ad Din  the first Sultan of the Sultanate of Mogadishu Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia  including the Mogadishu area  was inhabited very early by hunter gatherers of Khoisan descent  Although most of these early inhabitants are believed to have been either overwhelmed  driven away or  in some cases  assimilated by later migrants to the area  physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern day Jubaland and other parts of the south  The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile  Aweer  the Wa Ribi  and especially the Wa Boni          By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn  Digil and Mirifle  clan confederacy  who would go on to establish a local aristocracy  other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo  Wardai  and Ajuuraan  Ma adanle  had already formed settlements of their own in the sub region           Sarapion edit  The ancient city of Sarapion is believed to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu  It is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea  a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD  as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral      According to the Periplus  maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Somali Sea coast      During ancient times Mogadishu was part of the Somali city states that engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia  Ptolemic Egypt  Greece  Parthian Persia  Saba  Nabataea and the Roman Empire  Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo       Foundation and origins edit  The founding ethnicity of Mogadishu and its subsequent sultanate has been a topic of serious intrigue in Somali Studies  I M Lewis belied that the city was founded and ruled by a council of Arab and Persian families          However  the reference I M Lewis received traces back to one   th century text called the Kitab Al Zunuj  which has been discredited by modern scholars as unreliable and unhistorical                  More importantly  it contradicts oral   ancient written sources and archeological evidence on the pre existing civilizations and communities that flourished on the Somali coast  and to which were the forefathers of Mogadishu and other coastal cities  Thus  the Persian and Arab founding  myths  are regarded as an outdated false colonialist reflection on Africans ability to create their own sophisticated states      It has now been widely accepted that there were already existing communities on the Somali coast with local African leadership  to whom the Arab and Persian families had to ask for permission to settle in their cities      This is corroborated by the  st century AD Greek document the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea  detailing multiple prosperous port cities in ancient Somalia  as well as the identification of ancient Sarapion with the city that would later be known as Mogadishu      When Ibn Battuta visited the Sultanate in the   th century  he identified the Sultan as being of Barbara origin      an ancient term to describe the ancestors of the Somali people  According to Ross E  Dunn neither Mogadishu  or any other city on the coast could be considered alien enclaves of Arabs or Persians  but were in fact African towns      Yaqut al Hamawi  a famous Muslim medieval geographer in the year      describes Mogadishu as the most prominent town on the coast  Yaqut also mentioned Mogadishu as being a town inhabited by Berbers  described as  dark skinned  and considered ancestors of modern Somalis      By the thirteenth century  Ibn Sa id described Mogadishu  Merca and Barawa located in the Benadir coast had become Islamic and commercial centers in the Indian Ocean  He said the local people in the Benadir coast and the interior were predominantly inhabited by Somalis with a minority of Arab  Persian and Indian merchants living in the coastal towns      Ibn al Mujawir mentions the Banu Majid who fled the Mundhiriya region in Yemen in the year      and settled in Mogadishu and also traders from the port towns of Abyan and Haram      Mogadishu is traditionally inhabited by   main Reer Hamar Gibil Madow Dark skins  clan groupings  Somali  afarta reer xamar   These are the Moorshe  Iskashato  DhabarWeyne and the Bandawow  And with Moorshe being regarded as the oldest group in Mogadishu and is considered to be a sub clan of  Ajuran who established one of the most powerful medieval kingdoms in Africa called Ajuran Sultanate  The Gibil Madow Dark skins  faction of the Benadiri are said to hail from various Somali clan groups from the interior and from the north and make up the majority of Benadiris with a small minority being Gibil Cads Light skins            Medieval Period edit  Mogadishu Sultanate edit   Mogadishan currency Mogadishu Sultanate was a medieval Somali sultanate centered in southern Somalia  It rose as one of the pre eminent powers in the Horn of Africa under the rule of Fakhr ad Din before becoming part of the expanding Ajuran Empire in the   th century      The Mogadishu Sultanate maintained a vast trading network  dominated the regional gold trade  minted its own currency  and left an extensive architectural legacy in present day southern Somalia      A local city state which much influence over the hinterland neighboring coastal towns          Entrance of a coral stone house in Mogadishu  For many years Mogadishu functioned as the pre eminent city in the             Bilad al Barbar    Land of the Berbers    as medieval Arabic speakers named the Somali coast                  Following his visit to the city  the   th century Syrian historian Yaqut al Hamawi  a former slave of Greek origin  wrote a global history of many places he visited Mogadishu and called it the richest and most powerful city in the region and was an Islamic center across the Indian Ocean            Flag of the Ajuran  a Somali empire of which medieval Mogadishu was an important city   Almnara Tower  Mogadishu Ajuran Sultanate edit  In the early   th century  Mogadishu along with other coastal and interior Somali cities in southern Somalia and eastern Abyissina came under the Ajuran Sultanate control and experienced another Golden Age      By the     s  Mogadishu was no longer a vassal state and became a full fledged Ajuran city  An Ajuran family  Muduffar  established a dynasty in the city  thus combining two entities together for the next     years  the fortunes of the urban cities in the interior and coast became the fortunes of the other      During his travels  Ibn Sa id al Maghribi             noted that Mogadishu city had already become the leading Islamic center in the region      By the time of the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta s appearance on the Somali coast in       the city was at the zenith of its prosperity  He described Mogadishu as  an exceedingly large city  with many rich merchants  which was famous for its high quality fabric that it exported to Egypt  among other places          He also describes the hospitality of the people of Mogadishu and how locals would put travelers up in their home to help the local economy      Battuta added that the city was ruled by a Somali Sultan  Abu Bakr ibn Shaikh  Umar          He noted that Sultan Abu Bakr had dark skin complexion and spoke in his native tongue  Somali  but was also fluent in Arabic               The Sultan also had a retinue of wazirs  ministers   legal experts  commanders  royal eunuchs  and other officials at his beck and call      Ibn Khaldun       to       noted in his book that Mogadishu was a massive metropolis  He also claimed that the city was a very populous with many wealthy merchants      This period gave birth to notable figures like Abd al Aziz of Mogadishu  who was described as the governor and island chief of Maldives by Ibn Battuta             After him is named the Abdul Aziz Mosque in Mogadishu which has remained there for centuries      The island s appellation  Madagascar  is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the Middle Ages by Europeans      The name Madageiscar was first recorded in the memoirs of   th century Venetian explorer Marco Polo as a corrupted transliteration of the name Mogadishu  the famous port with which Polo had confused the island      Vasco Da Gama  who passed by Mogadishu in the   th century  noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre and many mosques with cylindrical minarets      In the   th century  Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya sailed to Mogadishu with cloths and spices for which they in return received gold  wax and ivory  Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat  wheat  barley  horses  and fruit on the coastal markets  which generated enormous wealth for the merchants      Mogadishu  the center of a thriving weaving industry known as toob benadir  specialized for the markets in Egypt and Syria       together with Merca and Barawa also served as transit stops for Swahili merchants from Mombasa and Malindi and for the gold trade from Kilwa      Jewish merchants from the Hormuz also brought their Indian textile and fruit to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood       Duarte Barbosa  the famous Portuguese traveler wrote about Mogadishu  c                It has a king over it  and is a place of great trade in merchandise  Ships come there from the kingdom of Cambay  India  and from Aden with stuffs of all kinds  and with spices  And they carry away from there much gold  ivory  beeswax  and other things upon which they make a profit  In this town there is plenty of meat  wheat  barley  and horses  and much fruit  it is a very rich place  The Portuguese Empire was unsuccessful of conquering Mogadishu permanently despite the City being destroyed by a powerful naval Portuguese commander called Jo o de Sep velda  after the Battle of Benadir a peace treaty was signed      According to the   th century explorer  Leo Africanus indicates that the native inhabitants of the Mogadishu polity were of the same origins as the denizens of the northern people of Zeila the capital of Adal Sultanate  They were generally tall with an olive skin complexion  with some being darker  They would wear traditional rich white silk wrapped around their bodies and have Islamic turbans and coastal people would only wear sarongs  and wrote Arabic as a lingua franca  Their weaponry consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as swords  daggers  spears  battle axe  and bows  although they received assistance from its close ally the Ottoman Empire and with the import of firearms such as muskets and cannons  Most were Muslims  although a few adhered to heathen bedouin tradition  there were also a number of Abyssinian Christians further inland  Mogadishu itself was a wealthy  and well built city state  which maintained commercial trade with kingdoms across the world      The metropolis city was surrounded by walled stone fortifications          Ajuran Sultanate collapsed in the   th century due to heavy taxing against their subjects which opened a rebellion  The ex subjects became a new wave of Somali immigrants  the Abgaal  moved both into Shabelle basin and into Mogadishu  and the city s mudaffar dynasty collapsed  A new political elite led by Abgaal Yaquub imams  with ties to the new leaders in the interior  moved into Shingaani quarter of the city  Remnants of the Ajuran lived in the other key quarters Xamarweyne  Ajuran merchants began to look for new linkages and regional trade opportunities since the Abgaal had commandeered the existing trading networks           Early Modern period      s     s  edit  Hiraab Imamate edit  By the   th century  the Hiraab Imamate was a powerful kingdom that ruled large parts of southern and central Somalia  It successfully revolted against the Ajuran Sultanate and established an independent rule for at least two centuries from the seventeen hundreds and onwards      The alliance involved the army leaders and advisors of the Habar Gidir and Duduble  a Fiqhi Qadi of Sheekhaal  and the Imam was reserved for the Abgaal who is believed to have been the first born  Once established  the Imamate ruled the territories from the Shabeelle valley  the Benadir province  the Mareeg area all the way to the arid lands of Mudug  which included the ancient port of Hobyo      Hobyo served as a prosperous commercial center for the Imamate while Mogadishu served as the political center where the ruling dynasty resided  The agricultural centres of El Dher and Harardhere included the production of sorghum and beans  supplementing with herds of camels  cattle  goats and sheep  Livestock  hides and skin  whilst the aromatic woods and raisins were the primary exports as rice  other foodstuffs and clothes were imported  Merchants looking for exotic goods came to the Imamate to buy textiles  precious metals and pearls   The commercial goods harvested along the Shabelle river were brought to Mogadishu for trade  Also  the increasing importance and rapid settlement of more southernly cities such as Mogadishu further boosted prosperity  as more and more ships made their way down the Somali coast to trade and replenish their supplies      By the late   th century  the Imamate began to decline due to internal problems  the Imamate also faced challenges from Imperialist kingdoms  the Zanzibari Sultan from the coast and Geledi Sultanate  and Hobyo Sultanate from the interior from both directions       Geledi Sultanate   Omani collaboration edit  By       Mogadishu was under the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of Zanzibar      The Geledi Sultans were at the height of their power  They dominated the southern ivory trade  and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland  The Omani Sultans  authority in Mogadishu  however  was largely nominal  When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city  he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi      This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in               The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians  but not the land itself  which was Somali owned       Italian Somaliland  late     s       edit  Main article

article  Somali Civil War By the late     s  Barre s regime had become increasingly unpopular  The authorities became ever more totalitarian  and resistance movements  encouraged by Ethiopia s communist Derg administration  sprang up across the country  This eventually led in      to the outbreak of the civil war  the toppling of Barre s government  and the disbandment of the Somali National Army  Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre s regime  Armed factions led by United Somali Congress

Operation in Somalia II  UNOSOM II  primarily in the south       Some of the militias that were then competing for power interpreted the UN troops  presence as a threat to their hegemony  Consequently  several gun battles took place in Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers  Among these was the Battle of Mogadishu of       a US apprehension of two high ranking lieutenants of faction leader Aidid  The UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on   March       having incurred more significant casualties       In       the Islamic Courts Union  ICU   an Islamist

January       as the Battle of Ras Kamboni  raged  TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed  a former colonel in the Somali Army  entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to

controlled most of the country       Following this defeat  the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions  Some of the more radical elements  including Al Shabaab  regrouped to
