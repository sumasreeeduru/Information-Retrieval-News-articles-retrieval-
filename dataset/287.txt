has been developed from research that indicates that often news about conflict has a value bias toward violence   It also includes practical methods for correcting this bias by producing journalism in both the mainstream and alternative media  and working with journalists  media professionals  audiences  and organizations in conflict  This concept was proposed by Johan Galtung     Other terms for this broad definition of peace journalism include conflict solution journalism  conflict sensitive journalism     constructive conflict coverage  and reporting the world     War journalism is journalism about conflict that has a value bias towards violence and violent groups   This usually leads audiences to overvalue violent responses to conflict and ignore non violent alternatives   This is understood to be the result of well documented news reporting conventions   These conventions focus only on physical effects of conflict  for example ignoring psychological impacts  and elite positions  which may or may not represent the actual parties and their goals   It is also biased toward reporting only the differences between parties   rather than similarities  previous agreements  and progress on common issues  the here and now  ignoring causes and outcomes   and zero sums  assuming that one side s needs can only be met by the other side s compromise or defeat      Peace journalism aims to correct for these biases  Its operational definition is  to allow opportunities for society at large to consider and value non violent responses to conflict      This involves picking up calls for  and articulations of  non violence policies from whatever quarter  and allowing them into the public sphere   Origins edit   Peace journalism workshop in Mindanao  the Philippines Peace journalism follows a long history of news publication  originating in non sectarian Christian peace movements and societies of the early   th century  which published periodicals     Sectarian organizations also created publications focused on peace as part of their proselytizing in the   th century  as did utopian communities of the period  From the   th century  a prominent example of sectarian journalism focused on peace was Dorothy Day s Catholic Worker     Besides being an element in the histories of pacifism and the social movement press  peace journalism is a set of journalism practices that emerged in the     s  Norwegian sociologist  peace researcher and practitioner Johan Galtung proposed the idea of peace journalism for journalists to follow to show how a value bias towards violence can be avoided when covering war and conflict      Christian organizations such as The World Council of Churches and The World Association for Christian Communication also practice peace journalism  Peace journalism aims to shed light on structural and cultural causes of violence  as they impact upon the lives of people in a conflict arena as part of the explanation for violence  It aims to frame conflicts as consisting of many parties and pursuing many goals rather than a simple dichotomy  An explicit aim of peace journalism is to promote peace initiatives from whatever quarter and to allow the reader to distinguish between stated positions and real goals   Necessity edit  Peace journalism came about through research arguing there s something wrong with typical conflict reporting   Research and practice in peace journalism outlines a number of reasons for the existence and dominance of war journalism in conflict news      Other interests edit  Firstly  the notion that media elites always act to preserve their favored status quo  and their own commercial and political interests  is given relatively little weight   Shared characteristics of the socio economic class  which heavily influences the production of journalism  are important   For example  their shared ideological pressures  perceptions  attitudes  and values form the basis of a  dominant reading  of facts that are selected to appear in news   These can then act to fix and naturalize meaning and hide the actual creation of meaning      However  even in the presence of powerful elite media interests against war  war journalism often dominates conflict discourse  Jake Lynch and Annabel McGoldrick show examples from Britain  Ireland  Georgia  and Iraq  where war journalism dominated coverage despite key influential media interests against war       Journalistic objectivity edit   Peace journalist Jake Lynch covering protests against joint US Australia military exercises in Australia  Therefore  not only political and economic  but also social and cultural factors have contributed to the dominance of war journalism in conflict reporting   With the growth of mass media  especially from the   th century  news advertising became the most important source of media revenue  Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue   This led to  Journalistic objectivity as an industry standard a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people        And in modern journalism  especially with the emergence of    hour news cycles  speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories   It is not possible for reporters to decide  from first principals  every time how they will report each and every story that presents itself       It follows that convention governs much of journalism  The rise of journalistic objectivity was part of a larger movement within western academia to a more empirical  just report the facts  epistemology and research paradigm   By the     s it was focused on the ideal of  objectivity        And although it came into fashion around the same period  Journalistic Objectivity must be distinguished from the Scientific Objectivity   For example the experimental sciences uses as  best practice    Inter laboratory replication  Random assignment of subjects to conditions  Efforts to ensure that human subjects and experimenters are ignorant of the expectations  hypotheses of the research  to avoid the Observer expectancy effect The Subject expectancy effect  Anonymous peer review  a form of peer review  to promote open and systematic exploration of meaning without subjective   political  bias  Careful analysis to ensure that research subjects are adequately representative of the general population  that is not overly atypical when compared to the average population  While it is arguable whether these experimental science safe guards provide  true objectivity   in the absence of these safeguards  journalism around conflict relies on three conventions to maintain its own form of  objectivity    also see journalistic objectivity   and is therefore distinct from Scientific Objectivity   Conventions edit  Firstly  to sell audiences to advertisers  reporting must appeal to as broad an audience as possible and therefore focuses on  facts  that  are the least controversial   Conflict processes are often controversial  so coverage of them risks alienating potential consumers  who may be sensitive to the exposure of structural or cultural predisposing factors      Secondly  a bias in favor of official sources means that  while it may appear uncontroversial  as there is only one official representative for the government on any given issue     and since only the official government is usually allowed to wield legal  sanctioned force within its territory      coverage will tend to privilege violent responses to conflict over non violent  social psychological  context informed responses      Journalists Annabel McGoldrick and Jake Lynch argue that non critical reporting of official sources is often rewarded by those sources  Through  information transactions   these same official sources allow uncritical journalists privileged access to information in the future      Thirdly and lastly   dualism  biasses journalistic objectivity towards violence   A decision to tell a story in that  bipolar  way can slip past  unnoticed  without drawing attention to itself because of its close resemblance  in shape and structure  to so much of the story telling we already take for granted        Gatekeeping edit  These conventions also form  gates  by which  gatekeepers  in journalism include or exclude various aspects of reality in final publication      In this way  proponents of peace journalism argue that in the media meaning occurs according to   a set of rules and relations established before the reality or the experience under discussion actually occurred        In war journalism the objectivity conventions serve this purpose  but are shadowy and unacknowledged       Gatekeeping  is therefore likely to be secretive and haphazard   This means they distort  and also fix  meaning in conflict coverage and obfuscate the production of meaning clarification needed       A recent example demonstrates how peace journalism evaluative criteria might be applied to show how much conventional conflict reporting is biased in favor of violence and violent groups  The example is the coverage leading up to the September      meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  and US President Barack Obama  Reporting was highly reactive and focused on the visible effects of the conflict  such as announcements and public disagreements between official spokespeople that appeared to disrupt peace efforts      Coverage was oriented to elites with little mention of non official peace efforts by individuals and groups such as the Hand in Hand network of schools  the Israeli Palestinian The Parents Circle Families Forum  Peace Now  Breaking the Silence  Physicians for Human Rights  Machsom Watch  and Checkpoint Watch  Hanan Ashrawi  non violent activist for human rights  founder of the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy  and member of the Palestinian Legislative Council           Also ignored were programmes that promote cultural exchange  for example  the Israeli Palestinian Aussie Rules football team The Peace Team   see here for official      team details  which played in the      and      AFL International Cups  Another is the current programme of Palestinian children s visits to the Old Yishuv Court Museum in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem   Events demonstrating non violent responses to the conflict were also ignored  a new example being the March           Conference on Civil Disobedience in the West Bank marking the centenary of International Women s Day      Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis lists further organizations working for peace in the region  whose activities are generally excluded from news on the Conflict  Reporting leading up to the September      meeting between Netanyahu  Abbas and Obama focused almost solely on highly divisive issues  such as Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem  and the diplomatic official status of Jerusalem  Coverage was also oriented towards differences  with a focus on the here and now   Potential benefits in physical  economic  and social security of peaceful relations were ignored  and  progress  towards peace was portrayed as having to come with one or more parties compromising and surrendering their positions on key issues  which is of course a zero sum orientation       Coverage generally ignored the background or context of positions  Positions were presented as unchangeable on any peaceful settlement  rather than the public  face  of unmet needs that often drive violent conflicts  Because of distrust between parties these needs are often not honestly expressed publicly      Thus a pattern of war journalism emerges  largely stemming from the objectivity conventions applied to conflict reporting   Peace journalism argues that this is likely to have important and consistent effects on the way audiences understand a conflict  In war journalism  violence is typically presented as only its own cause  ignoring the possibility of structural or psychological causes  Since violence is assumed to have no cause or explanation  such as the deprived needs of parties   conventional conflict reporting may leave viewers to conclude that the only  natural  or reasonable response to violence is more violence       That  more violence  the only language they understand  is an appropriate remedy   and that non violent responses are irrelevant or  unrealistic       This focus on only physical violent behavior is an example of what leading Conflict Analyst and Peace Researcher  Johan Galtung identifies as a major flaw in responses to inter communal conflict  the  Conservative Fallacy       This bias towards prioritizing violent actors with coverage is then expected by violent groups  through what is called a Feedback Loop       Parties to a conflict often try to use the media to advance their position  rather than being passive subjects  unaware of being observed  as assumed in sciences where humans are not the subjects  Journalist  and journalism Associate Professor  Jake Lynch notes that  it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such  but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence  that condition their behaviour       In this way war journalism is an example of the role of power in representation and of the media trying to fix meaning  in this case about violence and its causes  for  it to become naturalized so that is the only meaning it can possibly carry where you cannot see that anybody ever produced it       Thus  war journalism is understood as reporting on conflict in a way which imposes an artificially confined closed space  and closed time  with causes and exits existing only in the conflict arena       Peace journalism can then be understood as journalism that avoids this outside imposition  which more objectively assesses the possibility of conflicts taking place in open space  and open time with any number of causes and exits   Effects edit  The Salvadoran Civil War  largely a peasant revolution  took place          The USA supported the right wing government  During the war        people were killed        more went missing and another million exiled  On    March       the village of Ingenio Colima was attacked by paramilitaries who murdered all its occupants  At the time  the country s media gave a biased account of what took place  The intention today   in the face of open hostility from today s political leaders is to investigate and clarify what happened and to contribute to a national process of truth and reconciliation      The emotional effects of war journalism also make it more difficult for audiences to be aware of this biased presentation of conflict   War journalism takes advantage of the emotional  high  humans can get from fear through evolutionary psychological mechanisms       In a similar way  war journalism appeals to  lower order  needs for security and belonging        The pre frontal cortex  governing working memory  rational attentive functioning  and complex thought is inhibited by activation of the brain s fear centre  the limbic system      Audiences are thus deprived of cognitive resources with which to recognize the role of fear in encouraging war journalism consumption   This cognitive deprivation also further fixes meaning and increases the role of  automatically activated attitudes  which according to cognitive psychology   guide attention toward attitude consistent information  provide a template with which to interpret ambiguous information  and guide behaviour in a relatively spontaneous fashion         Therefore viewers are primed to pay more attention to future information  which is consistent with the automatically activated attitudes formed by war journalism   Research into the ever present framing clarification needed  in the media supports this conclusion   Certainly people can recall their own facts  forge linkages not made explicitly in the text  or retrieve from memory a causal explanation or cure that is completely absent from the text  In essence  this is just what professors encourage their students to do habitually   But Zaller         Kahneman and Tversky         and Iyengar         among others  suggest that on most matters of social or political interest  people are not generally so well informed and cognitively active  and that framing therefore heavily influences their responses to communications       Research shows that war journalism can have negative emotional impacts on audience members  These include feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness  compounded by increased anxiety  mood disturbance  sadness and a sense of disconnection with physical and social environments   Research by Galtung and Ruge        finds negativity bias in foreign news  This has also been confirmed more recently by Nohrstedt and Ottosen               This can affect reactions towards the conflict itself  and an audience s general psychological wellbeing  which biasses their view of the world as excessively chaotic and may cause serious anxiety and emotional difficulties  and a sense of disempowerment and disconnection        Vicarious trauma can increase these negative effects  where  even  normal   intelligent  educated individuals can become highly suggestible towards violent acts in formerly unexpected contexts       These negative emotional states may discourage audience members from criticism and challenge of the biassed information presented through war journalism   These public concerns may appear to be  someone else s problem  and best left to  experts   who alone have the necessary knowledge  time  and emotional endurance  These negative emotional responses may also discourage creative engagement with the conflict and conflict parties   This is especially troubling considering the critical role of creativity in conflict resolution and peacebuilding       Feedback loop edit  Peace journalism analysis suggests that  typical news on conflict  with its value bias towards violence and violent groups  has important effects on the parties to conflict   Firstly  peace journalism proponents argue that the bias in favour of publicity for violence and violent actors   plays into  the interests of violent actors to intimidate and disrupt  the peace process       This is an important example of the Feedback Loop effect   it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such  but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence  that condition their behaviour        This bias also weakens and punishes  with less publicity  non violent groups affected by a conflict  for their lack of violence   Nohrstedt and Ottosen        note   if traditional media themselves are unable to transmit alternative perspectives and voice the danger is that those     that feel marginalised will turn to terror in order to make a difference in the media agenda       The most visible actions of a group  of which one is not a member  are often considered representative of that group s behaviour  an effect called the  availability heuristic        Therefore war journalism s over selection of violent  as opposed to non violent  responses to conflict may actually foster a misperception of excessive threat between parties   This is then generally exaggerated by other inter group social cognitive biases within war journalism   These include biases towards  seeing an outgroup as more homogeneous  with less internal variety  than it really is  ignoring the variety of attitudes towards the conflict      seeing ambiguous situations  or negative group behavior  as playing out internal  and stable  group characteristics rather than external  and variable  circumstances      favourable ingroup outgroup comparison to increase collective self esteem      and members of groups who perceive themselves to be under threat to be more pressured internally to conform with and reinforce dominant group norms      premature and immediate resistance to ideas on positive responses to violence offered by members of outgroups      Indeed Dr  Louis Kriesberg  a sociologist at Syracuse University  and expert on conflict resolution points out that   conventional thinking among partisans in a fight generally attributes destructive persistence in a conflict to the enemy s character  asserting that the enemy is aggressive by nature  has evil leaders  or adheres to a hostile ideology       And Professor of World Religions  Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution  Marc Gopin  agrees with the importance of psychological factors in escalating conflict   being hated normally generates deep injury and corresponding anger in most recipients is what I call a  conflict dance  of action reaction       A peace journalism perspective also highlights another effect of typical conflict journalism on  the groups engaged in a conflict  war journalism s common focus on the human drama and tragedy of violence  Hamber and Lewis        note war journalism  often involves painting doomsday scenarios of victims who are irreparably damaged and for whom there appears to be no solution and no future        This creates an increased impediment for the victims of unreported crimes  And the positive experiences of those who have embarked upon a process of recovery is often ignored in war journalism       For example in Israel Palestine  victims of suicide bombing  house demolition  land and house theft  are often portrayed as defenceless  disempowered victims with no prospect of healing or positive response to their predicament      Effective non violent bridge building between communities such as the Hand in Hand Arab Jewish school network in Israel  are routinely ignored in war journalism coverage   Non violent initiatives illustrate what can be possible through peaceful responses to conflict but this information is artificially  filtered out  through the coverage biases of war journalism       Parties are therefore presented with a biassed picture of the entire conflict  favouring violent responses to the conflict   Parties are led to believe that that violence is the only way their needs can be met  thereby reinforcing and escalating cycles of dangerous retaliation between groups   Peace journalism would also charge that this pattern of conventional conflict reporting submerges the emotional cost of violent conflict and therefore makes the psychological aspects of cycles of revenge subtle  and so more difficult to prevent      All of this missed information could represent a crucial movement away from violence  as the only option for threatened groups towards peace  But only if they are not hidden by journalistic assumptions that they are irrelevant  and should not be reported  This is of special concern  given that the collective trauma suffered by a population  and the fear that this generates  can lead to a reduced capacity for decision making and action       Response edit  In response to war journalism s value bias in favour of violence  peace journalism promises two key benefits  for those concerned with objectivity in journalism  it aims to avoid and counteract the persistent bias of valuing violence and violent parties  Secondly  as all journalism must in some way appeal to the values of their audiences  for those who value the promotion of peace and social justice over violence  it provides a practical methodology      The  fixation of meaning  clarification needed  in war journalism is often hidden by the  scattered opposition facts  that often occur in its coverage  However these do not actually allow for  challenging a dominant frame  of pro violence   Framing  researcher Entman recommends   If educated to understand the difference between including scattered oppositional facts  and challenging a dominant frame  journalists might be better equipped to construct news that makes equally salient equally accessible to the average  inattentive  and marginally informed audience two or more interpretations of problems        Decisions edit  Hence  peace journalism is anchored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research  to map out solid ground beneath our feet  to declare  in advance  that we intend to use it  to assign meanings and draw distinctions        Decisions  on which of the almost infinite stories and facts to report  can be made openly and systematically  Lynch        shows how these two disciplines are important anchors for conflict journalism in that they employ the academic rigor of the social sciences including   openness about   and prepared to justify   starting assumptions for both observation and interpretation  and peer review   Built into social science  moreover  is an allowance for the participant observer effect   as soon as you start to observe something  you cannot avoid changing it       As such peace journalism considers the effect it has on audiences and parties with regard to it own  objectivity    Lynch and Galtung        elaborate on how this operates in conflict journalism    It is an important distinction in this context because journalism itself may be part of the extended pattern of conflictual relationships  in which parties and their shared relations find themselves embedded   if only by bringing an audience to the ringside  Tillett comments   In some situations  individuals  or groups  will  fight to the death   even when obviously losing all that they claim to be seeking  to avoid being seen to  back down  or  lose face           p       In a conflict  he continues   the presence of an audience generally makes it more likely that the protagonists will want to be seen to win  and that they will be less prepared to resolve than to fight   Schattschneider goes as far as to argue that spectators are  an integral part of the situation for  as likely as not  the audience determines the outcome of the fight        p           Inter group violence edit  Pakistan s the best example of PJ Conflict Analysis also provides guidance on mapping the hopes  needs  and fears of all parties to a conflict  including outwardly  impartial  third parties  and acknowledges the potential role of creativity  rather than assuming as war journalism does  that the positions of elites  power gradients and the struggle for power are the most important determinants of a conflict      These can then be assessed empirically in the conflict  and its potential resolution  rather than being ignored from the outset by journalists  as often is the case in war journalism   Therefore the importance in peace journalism of being willing to consider conflict as  open in space and time  with causes and exits anywhere         Lynch and Galtung        present an important example of this in the case of North and South Korea  indicating that journalists should not ignore the grassroots people that endure this conflict  and that comparisons and input from the reunified Germany may be helpful  as could consideration and dialogue with East Asia       The aim here is not to impose definite  answers   Conflict Analysis and Peace Research often elicit useful perspectives from those involved in the conflict  Empirical questions can then be put forward  and tested by investigative journalism  These processes demonstrate that conflict is not static and intractable   These insights challenge the psychological tendencies of war journalism noted above to present negative outgroup behaviour as the result of stable group characteristics   Indeed the non linear cycle of violence outlined by Elworthy and Rogers         proposes that the key stage to prevent a cycle of revenge  is before the anger becomes bitterness       And peace journalism can allow for the consideration that  bitterness can be thought of as anger   memory   storing away trauma in a  trauma bank  and  eventually  withdrawing it as  glory  through further violence       Through reporting  which does not routinely ignore causes and non linear cycles of violence  peace journalism can help expand the cognitive and emotional space for peace initiatives that contribute peacebuilding      The Feedback Loop of cause and effect in the media could then support the creation and continuation of peaceful process structures        This would involve demonstrating a pattern of coverage that leads present and potential peace actors to predict that their efforts will be reported by journalists to  create opportunities for society at large to consider and value non violent responses to conflict       This in turn could reduce negative inter group social psychological tendencies   This may be particularly important for projects such as the examples in Israel Palestine of the  Hand in Hand  network of schools   Peace Now    Breaking the Silence    Physicians for Human Rights    Machsom Watch  and  Checkpoint Watch   which as mainly grassroots initiatives  are generally more fragile than mid level or upper level peace activities       Examples edit  As a pedagogical practice  peace journalism training often uses pairs of war journalism and peace journalism reports to illustrate how the same story can be reported in either style  and that there is the potential to produce peace journalism within the time and travel constraints of mainstream journalism  For a peace journalism war journalism pair on conflict in the Philippines see Peace Journalism in the Philippines  The transcripts of this report pair  along with an outline of a course in peace journalism can be viewed at A course in peace journalism  For a pair of reports covering Israel Palestine plus a link to practical tips for avoiding journalism that is biased towards violence and violent actors  see The Middle East War Journalism and Peace Journalism  The documentary News from the Holy Land also contains another pair of reports on the Israel Palestine conflict  The free Reporting the World publication contains pairs of peace journalism war journalism news reports on Macedonia  the Democratic Republic of Congo  Iraq and Indonesia  The Cairo based Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation  CIDT  seeks to build bridges of understanding between the Arab and Western world through analysis of the news from these regions  To Be an Effective Advocate for Peace  Media Distortions Must Be Addressed analyses situations where conflict reporting has contributed to the actual worsening of conflict  An example from the Hindustan Times  showing how peace journalism can also operate through awards and commendations publicising and supporting the work of non violence and cooperative conflict resolution  Afghan  Palestinian win UN award in honour of Gandhi  Peace journalism can also take the form of the public dissemination of research on the successful conditions for non violent conflict resolution and negotiation such as  Unequal Partners Can t Negotiate by Paul Duffill  writing for New Matilda  For an example in Australia see this report on the  protests of the      US and Australian military exercises  Talisman Sabre  TED talk by Julia Bacha on the danger of news about conflict only covering violent actors   excluding non violent programmes Julia Bacha  Pay attention to nonviolence  Budrus documentary film  telling the true story of the successful non violent struggle of the people of the village Bubrus in the West Bank of Palestine  Arab revolutions and the power of nonviolent action by Stephen Zunes  writing for the National Catholic Reporter  Anne Applebaum argues in this piece for the Washington Post that though it is tempting to lump all the recent revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa into a single  Arab revolution   or  Arab Spring  the differences between them may turn out to be more important than their similarities  In the Arab world  it s        not       This report from Michelle Shephard Somalia s Al Qaeda  A chance for Shabab to negotiate  is an example of a partial PJ piece  where some elements of PJ are present   The piece does not assume there are only two parties  and doesn t assume parties  goals exactly match reported positions  and explores contradictory goals within a single official party   It also reports on peaceful responses to conflict   This report however is generally closed in space and time  with little exploration of the reasons behind the conflict between warring groups  including  considering the conduct of the weak national government   or whether parties other than Al Queda Al Shabab have used violence  and assumes that causes and sources of solutions are restricted to within Somalia itself   The report also does not explore non elite efforts at peace  even though Somalis rally against al Qaeda allies suggests that there is local support for peace efforts   Projects edit   A peace journalism project conducted by the Kenya Pastoralist Journalist Network when   The feedback loop of cause and effect     is a useful reference point here for conceptualising the various  entry points  for peace journalism in the wider phenomenology of news   Peace journalism has been applied in training and dialogue with journalists in a variety of settings       However peace journalism has also been applied in a number of other sectors  These interventions are extremely varied and  in addition to the examples noted above  include international NGO work with local partners and networks in areas of conflict      the promotion of communication rights  participatory processes  community based communication approaches for development  and social change and peacebuilding  for example see Current Projects Communication for Social Change    World Association for Christian Communication programmes and further reading sections below  and work with organisations who may themselves become sources for peace journalism       Government and inter governmental approaches have also facilitated peace journalism in preventing media manipulation and promoting people centred media in post conflict societies and through the United Nations       Likewise upper level editors and media organisation managers have participated in peace journalism workshops and seminars       Criticism edit  Peace journalism has aroused a number of debates and criticisms from scholars and journalists   Objectivity edit  Some opponents characterise peace journalism as  activist  new writing that  while being socially engaged to promote peace  is unlike mainstream objective  or balanced  news coverage that seeks to remain impartial or above the fray      This raises the important question  how objective and impartial is peace journalism   From a peace journalism perspective the claim  we just report the facts  must include the facts of how and according to what principals these  facts  came to meet the reporter  and how the finished coverage came to meet the facts   The Press Institute of India s conflict reporting guidelines point out   Factual accuracy in a single story is no substitute for the total truth   A single story  which is factually accurate can nonetheless be misleading       As such peace journalism is generally more objective  with its inclusion of implications for international law  positive developments in both elite peacemaking and capacity building  and non elite perspectives and peacebuilding initiatives   This objectivity  unconstrained by Objectivity Conventions  highlights the truth orientation of peace journalism  to  expose untruths on all sides       In doing so peace journalism aims to de naturalise clarification needed  meaning by highlighting the creation of war journalism dominated meaning in conflict   Indeed Hall        recommends that the unfixing of meaning   is often a struggle to increase the diversity of things which subjects can be of the possibility of identities which people have not seen represented before   you have to intervene in exactly that powerful exchange between image and its psychic meaning   with which we invest images  and  expose and deconstruct the work of representation which the stereotype is doing       And many international negotiation experts and peace practitioners note the importance of non violent confrontation and the equalisation of power  before effective negotiation and dialogue between parties can take place       Through reporting on grassroots and local voices for peace  the power of these voices is increased  as they become  reality checkers  for often contradictory statements from elite representatives involved in violence   Through this non violent  ideational confrontation   audiences and parties to conflict may be more able to negotiate their own meaning  outside of fixed elite narratives   Thus  mounting anomalies may expose contradictions  and herald a paradigm shift  as local pro peace perspectives previously consigned to a zone of  deviance  become  legitimate controversy       For example  prior to the presidential election of      in Afghanistan  the counter insurgency approach  advocated by US commander General McCrystal  contained elements of relationship building to a degree that is unusual among military approaches in Afghanistan       In the lead up to the Presidential election in Afghanistan in mid       an unusual example of this relationship sensitive approach to counter insurgency was applied by US troops in the Nawa district  of Helmand province  However  the overwhelming majority of attention that Nawa district received in       the year that this new strategy was first applied  was on reports of violence there  principally in early to mid July  during intensified military operations   For example in       seven out of ten articles in the  Washington Post online   tagged under the key word  Nawa   focussed almost exclusively on violence and US combat operations in the region  with similar ratios appearing in online coverage from the Guardian  the Independent  and the New York Times       In fact  relationship building has succeeded  in contrast to violent methods  in winning  hearts and minds  in Nawa  Afghanistan  but also on a larger scale in Iraq      The US military s promotion of these methods as successful may of course be a less than  objective  evaluation  However the military s promotion of relationship building as a legitimate tactic to attempt in addressing violence does contribute to the normative strength of non violence responses to conflict   In acknowledging the importance of  at least being seen to  build cooperative relationships with local populations  over simply violently suppressing disagreement to military policy  the legitimacy of these non violent responses to violence conflict is reinforced  And indeed researchers also note the importance of relationship building for  vertical and horizontal integration  in peacebuilding     to support the sustainability of institutional reform     and in promoting  peace with justice  and respect for human rights      Peace journalism aims to retain the role of observer in reporting conflict  rather than functioning like war journalism  which intervenes in conflict to increase the influence of violent actors and violent actions   Peace journalism  by presenting  anomalous  local perspectives which contradict violence exacerbating war journalism  may help to expose these violent group s attempts to fix and naturalise clarification needed  meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence        Indeed  exploration of new types of relationships between Afghan locals and the international community  contradicts assertions made at the time  with the support of war journalism  by insurgents and the US government  that the negative effects of foreign occupation could only be ended with their violent expulsion  or that        more combat troops were the most critical component for sustainable peace in Afghanistan       Explaining violence is justifying it edit  This criticism can be represented by neo conservative proponent Richard Perle  that one must  decontextualise terror   any attempt to discuss the roots of terrorism is an attempt to justify it   It simply needs to be fought and destroyed        While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context  it is also an example of many of the social cognitive inter group biases noted above  and exemplifies what social psychologist Phillip Zimbardo  of the Stanford Prison Experiments  calls a Fundamental Attribution Error   the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions  while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables       The notion of human needs driving violence and being significantly effected by violence  borrowed from Conflict Analysis and Peace Research      and insight into the stratified nature of reality  borrowed from Critical Realism       highlights why an explanation of violence is not the same thing as a justification for it  Critical Realism understands reality as existing in a number of levels or strata  Each strata deals with larger and more complex phenomena than that ones below it   These strata might begin from physical mechanisms at the most basic level  followed by chemical mechanisms  then biological  followed by psychological and finally social   Activity at each lower strata contributes to  but can never fully explain  the new mechanisms that develop in higher strata  in a process called  emergence  from the upper strata   For example  competing theories of sub atomic structure  perhaps at the physical level  influence but cannot fully explain the outcome of the reaction  Na  HCl    NaCl   H   at the chemical level    Likewise the individual psychologies of a landlord and tenant cannot fully explain their relationship in the social strata  which is also influenced by other  things that operate at the social stratum  including laws and culture      Structural and cultural explanations for violence generally deal with the social strata  that is relationships between people and groups  An explanation of this violence is not the same as ignoring the role of individual choice and psychology  the violence that  emerges  at the social level is the result of a complex interaction of influences from lower strata  individual choices and psychology  and structures which exist primarily at the social strata  such as laws and culture    So to give cultural or structural explanations of violence is not the same as saying that these social influences override the role the individual choice  which is located in a lower stratum and therefore occurs under different conditions   Take the case where an individual s anger  brought on from previous trauma  becomes bitterness  which is followed by their own violent acts  following Elworthy and Rogers        cycle of violence noted above      An individual has still made a choice to deprive the victim of their violence of their human needs  probably safety and security  even though their own human needs have also been violated earlier   The point is not that they must be seen as  either a innocent victim or an evil perpetrator   The practical point is the prevention of violence  and the healing of all those whose needs have been violated  This approach does not assume that the best solution for stopping individual violence necessarily exists at the level where an individual makes a choice to act violently  which happens at the psychological level    In some cases punishment or imprisonment may be necessary   However Conflict Analysis and Peace Research suggest that  given the failure of the psychological  medical and social sciences  including education  to eliminate the persistent rates of psychotic tendencies in human groups  psychologists estimate that on average   percent of any population have psychotic tendencies       a more promising approach may to look at what social  economic  cultural conditions and what inter group relations enable individuals such as Hitler  Osama Bin Laden  Stalin and Pol Pot  to realise their desire for mass violence  Conflict Analysis and Peace Research does not primarily focus on understanding the individual psychology of these individuals  at the psychological stratum   but on how these individuals may be prevented from taking up a position in society where they are able to direct inter communal violence  at the social stratum   Indeed in peace journalism the role of individual agency is given a lot of importance   For example journalists are encouraged  in peace journalism workshops  to work peace journalism into the existing media structures   And peace journalism urges journalists to investigate the possibility that  even in violent situations  there are always voices for peace  and to search these voices out  when reporting what the Objectivity Conventions might ignore from the outset        Likewise the role of individual choice is not ignored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research  and leading scholar practitioner  John Paul Lederach notes that   I have not experienced any situation in conflict  no matter how protracted or severe  from Central America to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa  where there have not been people who had a vision for peace  emerging often from their own experience of pain   Far too often  however  these same people people are overlooked and disempowered either because they do not represent  official  power  whether on the side of government  or  of the various militias  or because they are written off as biased and too personally affected by the conflict         Structure versus agency edit  Hanitzsche        argues that  the failures of corporate journalism cannot be overcome by an individualistic and voluntaristic conceptualization of news making  To have any impact on the ways news is being made  and the critical discussion thereof  the advocates of peace journalism must address the structural constraints of news production   a peaceful culture is the precondition of peace journalism        Structure is a key concern in peace journalism  along with the influence of structure on content pluralism in news        And a number of projects that apply peace journalism  some of which are outlined above  demonstrate that peace journalism activism is not limited to journalists themselves  Indeed  conflict media content analyses are important educational resources for audiences  NGOs and journalists  to show how deficiencies in content can be used to campaign for more structural pluralism       These varied approaches demonstrate that inroads have been  and are still being made  in peace journalism activism in the areas Hackett        identifies as necessary to address challenges of structure and to  make peace journalism possible   reforming journalism from within  and also creating alternative media organisations  and intervening in the broader fields in which journalism find itself        Audiences edit  Hanitszche        criticises peace journalism  noting that media users are often  fragmented and active audiences instead of a passive mass   leading to a selective use of supplied products         Likewise Devereux        notes that media audiences  may have different expectations of media genres       and Turnbull        argues that in media research a serious problem is just to limit and define audiences and therefore relevant media practices        Indeed Hall        notes that the meaning of media messages changes  as you move from one person to another  one group to another  one part of society to another         And Lynch        points out  drawing from Hall        that  the meanings of media messages are made  at least partly  at the point of reception  in a process influenced chiefly by the socio economic position of the reader or viewer         As such Hall        notes that in a negotiated or oppositional manner  meaning often   contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements  it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations  abstract   while  at a more restricted  situational  situated  level  it makes its own ground rules   it operates with exceptions to the rule  It accords the privileged position to the dominant definitions of events while reserving the right to make a more negotiated application to  local conditions   And indeed for many peace journalists it is the visibility of  local conditions  that allows for oppositional and negotiated meaning  Lynch       argues that  for audiences to produce oppositional or negotiated readings of media messages assumes they have enough directly relevant personal and social experience against which to measure them         This is often not the case with international conflict  Indeed Hall s       own example of the negotiation of meaning is the case of an industrial factory worker  willing to challenge official justifications in the media for an Industrial Relations Bill limiting his or her right to strike  citation needed  Peace journalism analysis shows that the facts absent in audiences  understanding of conflict  can closely mirror those neglected in war journalism  A notable example is Philo and colleagues  research into media coverage of the Israel Palestine conflict in the UK media        With mainstream media neglecting the Palestinian narrative that Palestinian refugees lost their land and homes when Israel was established  audiences exhibited consistent ignorance about the basic facts of the conflict  for example where the bulk of refugees came from  and tended to perceive Palestinians as  starting the violence  and therefore Israeli authorities as forced to  respond  violently to prevent or contain this action  which has no possible rationale and therefore no potential non violent resolution        Indeed five years earlier  when reporting results of the study  Philo        noted that   This pattern of reporting clearly influenced how some viewers understood the conflict   The gaps in public knowledge closely parallel those in the news  The Palestinian perspective  that they have lost their land and are living under occupation  was effectively absent  It is perhaps not surprising that some viewers believed that they were simply being aggressive and trying to take land from the Israelis        This omission of the Palestinian perspective was so serious that Helen Boaden  Head of News at the BBC  concluded in an internal email   we fail to give enough context and history to this highly charged story and that we neglect the Palestinian narrative   In our response  we ve tried to come up with practical ways to remedy our weaknesses        The Israeli Palestinian conflict has also been the focus of research by Yifat Mor and colleagues  who examined how social media  namely Facebook  can be a tool to promote dialogue between both parties       This is an important illustration of the consistent effect of war journalism across general audiences   the pattern of misunderstanding almost exactly matching   missing elements from the story habitually presented in the mainstream media         General media audiences as a group are conceptualised within the Feedback Loop of cause and effect        Approaches edit  Two peace practitioner scholars  John Paul Lederach and Johan Galtung present two quite different models for conflict resolution and peace building  Lederach        presents an  Elictive Model  which is aims  primarily at discovery  creation  and solidification of models that emerge from the resources present in a particular setting and respond to needs in that context  and to not impose third party knowledge from trainer to participant        This approach  was applied in a dialogue in      entitled  Reporting the sic   Iraq  what went right   What went wrong    Included were Heads of News from the BBC and CNN  the editor of the Guardian  and several senior reporters who had also been reporting the war from Iraq        Drawing on  the resources in the room  recommendations for the coverage of conflict included    Do not report a  line  from an official source without obtaining and citing independent evidence as to its reliability  Acknowledge that the important job of testing arguments is best done if they are juxtaposed with  and weighed against  alternative  countervailing arguments  All newsrooms genuinely interested in offering a service to the public must think long and hard about  conduit  journalism and  in particular  whether their political correspondents are being used in this way        Galtung s TRANSCEND approach in contrast  focuses on the role a third party to  unstick  violent conflicts and stimulate creativity  This is done by  probing deeply into the nature of parties  goals  expanding the spectrum of acceptable solutions  and opening up cognitive space for fresh potentialities not conceived of by conflict parties         In one on one conversation style dialogues  the task is to stimulate creativity  develop new perspectives  and make the conflict parties  ready for the table         Lynch        recounts a notable example of this approach during a peace journalism forum of Middle Eastern journalists  in Amman  in        Discussions often devolved into national groups blaming the journalists of the other countries for not confronting their governments  lack of movement towards peace  Galtung himself challenged the participants to   imagine a future Middle East they wanted to see  and start to think aloud  in cross national groups  about how they might play a part in bringing it about        A Galtungian perspective  as a foundation for much of peace journalism  insists that  the journalist focus on root causes of conflict such as poverty or prior abuse  and not merely focus on events associated with violent political encounters         Through this approach peace journalism could act to  disembed  seemingly immutable official positions from the greater context of a conflict by exploring background to a conflict  challenging propaganda  and making visible official and local initiatives for peaceful conflict resolution  These two approaches differ not only in the  how  of Conflict Resolution but the  who    Lederach generally outlines a  middling out  approach where  the level with the greatest potential for establishing an infrastructure that can sustain the peacebuilding process over the long term appears to be the middle range         He argues that grassroots approaches are generally the more fragile since their participants are often concerned with day to day issues of survival        Upper level approaches assume a high level of integration between elites and grassroots  that peace agreements reached there  are relevant to and capable of practical implementation at the local level        Galtung on the other hand argues that upper level leaders often actually feel excluded from facilitated peace processes  with the modern focus on grassroots and civil society initiatives        The root of conflict is incompatible goals  pursued by parties which result in violent attitudes and behavior  It follows that  people are more able to discuss a root problem when they sense a solution somewhere   A glimmer of light at the end of a tunnel makes it considerably more easy sic  to admit that we are in a tunnel         In Galtung s work  the most accessible way to influence these goals had been to work with those who officially defined them and led policy the upper level leaders  The importance of accurate and complete Conflict Analysis for a given conflict highlights how these two approaches can be complementary  Practical Conflict Analysis is often aimed at identifying the easiest  peace levers  to pull  within a conflict to  unstick  violent inter group relations  This contrasts with intervening in a conflict with pre set ideas of how a resolution will be found  and with which specific level or group to begin working  Therefore Conflict Analysis may indicate which  entry points  offer the most promising chance to transform the relations between parties  And from this it will follow which approach  or combination of approaches  are likely to work from that entry point  whether it be at the grassroots  mid level or upper level or a combination   This integrative approach is summed up by peace practitioner and researcher Wendy Lambourne   to rely on only one theoretical approach in peace practice risks being culturally blind         Similar approaches edit  Sometimes also called conflict solution journalism  conflict sensitive journalism     and constructive conflict coverage   A similar approach is also found in preventive journalism  which extends the principles to social  economic  environmental or institutional problems  Peace journalism is one of several approaches and movements in journalism history  including advocacy journalism  development communication journalism  the new journalism  and public or civic journalism  which reject the universal or hegemonic claims to neutrality of professional journalism in the developed West        This
