Lacroix commissioned a study to determine whether its news was biased  and if so  to what extent  He said   Our job   and we take it seriously   is to ensure that the information that we put out is fair and unbiased in everything that we do       The study  the methodology of which was not specified  was due to report results in the fall of           In April       the Conservatives accused pollster Frank Graves of giving partisan advice to the Liberal Party of Canada  noting his donations to the party since       Graves directed a number of public opinion research projects on behalf of the CBC as well as other media organizations  and also appeared on a number of CBC television programs relating to politics  An investigation conducted by the CBC ombudsman found no evidence to support these allegations  stating that personal donor history is not relevant to one s objectivity as a pollster      The CBC itself has denied all allegations of bias  saying that  It is the duty of CBC News to inform its viewers across the country about what is happening  without bias or prejudice  and without telling them what to think  We believe that it is our obligation to report fairly and
