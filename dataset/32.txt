The Spring and Autumn Annals or Chunqiu is an ancient Chinese chronicle that has been one of the core Chinese classics since ancient times   The Annals is the official chronicle of the State of Lu  and covers a     year period from     to     BC   It is the earliest surviving Chinese historical text to be arranged in annals form       Because it was traditionally regarded as having been compiled by Confucius  after a claim to this effect by Mencius   it was included as one of the Five Classics of Chinese literature    The Annals records main events that occurred in Lu during each year  such as the accessions  marriages  deaths  and funerals of rulers  battles fought  sacrificial rituals observed  celestial phenomena considered ritually important  and natural disasters      The entries are tersely written  averaging only    characters per entry  and contain no elaboration on events or recording of speeches     During the Warring States period          BC   a number of commentaries to the Annals were created that attempted to elaborate on or find deeper meaning in the brief entries in the Annals   The Commentary of Zuo  Zuo zhuan      the best known of these commentaries  became a classic in its own right  and is the source of more Chinese sayings and idioms than any other classical work      Contents    History and content   Commentaries   Influence   Translations   See also   References      Works cited     External links   History and content edit  The Spring and Autumn Annals was likely composed in the  th century BC  and apart from the Bamboo Annals is the only such work to have survived from that period      By the time of Confucius  in the  th century BC  the term  springs and autumns   ch nqi      Old Chinese  t un ts iw  had come to mean  year  and was probably becoming a generic term for  annals  or  scribal records       The Annals was not the only work of its kind  as many other Eastern Zhou states also kept annals in their archives     The Annals is a succinct scribal record  with terse entries that record events such as the accessions  marriages  deaths  and funerals of rulers  battles fought  sacrificial records observed  natural disasters  and celestial phenomena believed to be of ritual significance      The entries average only    characters in length  the longest entry in the entire work is only    characters long  and a number of the entries are only a single character long      There are    entries that read simply  tung    pinyin  zh ng   meaning  a plague of insects   probably locusts      Some modern scholars have questioned whether the entries were ever originally intended as a chronicle for human readers  and have suggested that the Annals entries may have been intended as  ritual messages directed primarily to the ancestral spirits       Commentaries edit  Since the text of this book is terse and its contents limited  a number of commentaries were composed to explain and expand on its meanings  The Book of Han vol     lists five commentaries   The Commentary of Zou       The Commentary of Jia       The Commentary of Gongyang       The Commentary of Guliang       The Commentary of Zuo        also known as       No text of the Zou or Jia commentaries has survived  The surviving commentaries are known collectively as the Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals  The Gongyang and Guliang commentaries were compiled during the  nd century BC  although modern scholars had suggested they probably incorporate earlier written and oral traditions of explanation from the period of Warring States  They are based upon different editions of the Spring and Autumn Annals  and are phrased as questions and answers  The Commentary of Zuo  also known as the Zuo Zhuan  composed in the early  th century BC  is a general history covering the period from     to     BC which follows the succession of the rulers of the State of Lu  Modern scholars disagree about whether it is truly a commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals or an independent work  In any case  scholars have found it by far the most useful among the three surviving  commentaries  both as a historical source for the period and as a guide to interpreting the Annals   Influence edit  The Annals is one of the core Chinese classics and had an enormous influence on Chinese intellectual discourse for nearly      years      This was due to Mencius  assertion in the  th century BC that Confucius himself edited the Annals  an assertion which was accepted by the entire Chinese scholarly tradition and went almost entirely unchallenged until the early   th century     The Annals  terse style was interpreted as Confucius  deliberate attempt to convey  lofty principles in subtle words   w iy n d y             Not all scholars accepted this explanation  Tang dynasty historiographer Liu Zhiji believed the Commentary of Zuo was far superior to the Annals  and Song dynasty prime minister Wang Anshi famously dismissed the Annals as  a fragmentary court gazette  du nl n ch ob o             Many Western scholars have given similar evaluations  the French sinologist  douard Chavannes referred to the Annals as  an arid and dead chronicle      The Annals have become so evocative of the era in which they were composed that it is now widely referred to as the Spring and Autumn period      Translations edit
