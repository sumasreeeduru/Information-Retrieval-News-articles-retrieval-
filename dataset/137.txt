on Saturday    January          Its release was initiated and sponsored by the British occupational administration and preceded by a magazine titled Diese Woche  meaning This Week in English      which had first been published in November       After disagreements with the British  the magazine was handed over to Rudolf Augstein as chief editor  and was renamed Der Spiegel  From the first edition in January       Augstein held the position of editor in chief  which he retained until his death on   November       After       the magazine was owned by Rudolf Augstein and John Jahr  Jahr s share merged with Richard Gruner in      to form the publishing company Gruner   Jahr  In       Augstein bought out Gruner   Jahr for DM     million and became the sole owner of Der Spiegel  In       Gruner   Jahr bought back a     share in the magazine  In       Augstein restructured the company to make the employees shareholders  All employees with more than three years seniority were offered the opportunity to become an associate and participate in the management of the company  as well as in the profits  Since       Der Spiegel has been headquartered in its own building in the old town part of Hamburg     Der Spiegel s circulation rose quickly  From        copies in       it grew to        in      and         in       It was nearly         copies in           By the     s  it had reached a plateau at about         copies  When the German re unification in      made it available to a new readership in former East Germany  the circulation exceeded one million  The magazine s influence is based on two pillars  firstly the moral authority established by investigative journalism since the early years and proven alive by several impressive scoops during the     s  secondly the economic power of the prolific Spiegel publishing house  Since       it has produced the TV program Spiegel TV  and further diversified during the     s  During the second quarter of      the circulation of Der Spiegel was     million copies      In       Spiegel Online was launched          It has separate and independent editorial staff from Der Spiegel  In       the circulation of Der Spiegel was           copies      Der Spiegel had an average circulation of           copies in           In      the magazine started a new regional supplement in Switzerland      It was the first regional supplement of the magazine which covers    page review of Switzerland      In      Der Spiegel was employing the equivalent of    full time fact checkers  which the Columbia Journalism Review called  most likely the world s largest fact checking operation       The same year it was the third best selling general interest magazine in Europe with a circulation of           copies      In       Der Spiegel became involved in a journalistic scandal after it discovered and made public that one of its leading reporters  Claas Relotius  had  falsified his articles on a grand scale            Reception edit  When Stefan Aust took over in       the magazine s readers realized that his personality was different from his predecessor  In       a documentary by Stephan Lamby quoted him as follows   We stand at a very big cannon       Politicians of all stripes who had to deal with the magazine s attention often voiced their disaffection for it  The outspoken conservative Franz Josef Strau  contended that Der Spiegel was  the Gestapo of our time   He referred to journalists in general as  rats       The Social Democrat Willy Brandt called it  Schei blatt   i e   a  shit paper   during his term in office as Chancellor      Der Spiegel often produces feature length articles on problems affecting Germany  like demographic trends  the federal system s gridlock or the issues of its education system  and describes optional strategies and their risks in depth                      The magazine plays the role of opinion leader in the German press       Investigative journalism edit  Der Spiegel has a distinctive reputation for revealing political misconduct and scandals  Online Encyclop dia Britannica emphasizes this quality of the magazine as follows   The magazine is renowned for its aggressive  vigorous  and well written expos s of government malpractice and scandals       It merited recognition for this as early as      when the federal parliament launched an inquiry into Spiegel s accusations that bribed members of parliament had promoted Bonn over Frankfurt as the seat of West Germany s government  During the Spiegel scandal in       which followed the release of a report about the possible low state of readiness of the German armed forces  minister of defense and conservative figurehead Franz Josef Strau  had Der Spiegel investigated  In the course of this investigation  the editorial offices were raided by police while Rudolf Augstein and other Der Spiegel editors were arrested on charges of treason  Despite a lack of sufficient authority  Strau  even went after the article s author  Conrad Ahlers  who was consequently arrested in Spain where he was on holiday  When the legal case collapsed  the scandal led to a major shake up in chancellor Konrad Adenauer s cabinet  and Strau  had to stand down  The affair was generally received as an attack on the freedom of the press  Since then  Der Spiegel has repeatedly played a significant role in revealing political grievances and misdeeds  including the Flick Affair      The Spiegel scandal is now remembered for altering the political culture of post war Germany and with the first mass demonstrations and public protests being a turning point from the old Obrigkeitsstaat  authoritarian state  to a modern democracy  citation needed  In       the magazine supported WikiLeaks in publishing leaked materials from the United States State Department  along with The Guardian  The New York Times  El Pa s  and Le Monde     and in October      with the help of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden unveiled the systematic wiretapping of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel s private cell phone over a period of over    years at the hands of the National Security Agency s Special Collection Service  SCS       The leading role of the magazine in investigative journalism and its monopoly came to end in      since other German media outlets  including S ddeutsche Zeitung  Bild  ARD and ZDF  began to effectively deal with political scandals       Criticism edit  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding

its use of language  In       writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger published his essay Die Sprache des Spiegels   The Language of Der Spiegel    in which he criticized what he called a  pretended objectivity   Wolf Schneider  an eminent journalist and stylist has called Der Spiegel  the biggest mangler of the German language  and used quotations from the magazine as examples of inept German in his style guides  Their criticism was not so much one of linguistic aesthetics as an argument that Der Spiegel  hides and distorts its actual topics and issues by manipulative semantics and rhetoric rather than by reporting and analyzing them   In       however  Enzensberger admitted in a written statement that no other contemporary German magazine attained the Spiegel s level of objectivity  Opinions about the level of language employed by Der Spiegel changed in the late     s  After hiring many of Germany s best feature writers  Der Spiegel has become known for its  Edelfedern    noble quills  wordsmiths   The magazine frequently wins the Egon Erwin Kisch Prize for the best German feature  Der Spiegel ended up joining the ranks of the guardians of proper grammar and jargon with the Zwiebelfisch    printer s  pie   column on the magazine s website  which has even produced several best selling books  Some critics  in particular the media historian Lutz Hachmeister and the Augstein biographer and former Der Spiegel author Otto K hler  have brought charges against the magazine s dealings with former Nazis  even SS officers  Allegedly  Der Spiegel  which at other times showed no restraint when exposing the Nazi past of public figures  distorted history and covered up for criminals after enlisting insiders hired to write about Third Reich topics  citation needed  Its early reports and serials about the Reichstag fire  written by former SS officers Paul Carell  who had also served as chief press spokesman for Nazi Germany s Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop  and Fritz Tobias  have since been considered influential in historiography because since the     s the Spiegel reports written by these two authors have been corroborated by authoritative historian Hans Mommsen        fabrication scandal edit  On    December       Der Spiegel made public that reporter Claas Relotius had admitted that he had  falsified his articles on a grand scale   inventing facts  persons and quotations in at least    of his stories          The magazine uncovered the fraud after a co author of one of Relotius s stories  Juan Moreno  became suspicious of the veracity of Relotius s contributions and gathered evidence against him      Relotius resigned  telling the magazine that he was  sick  and needed to get help  Der Spiegel left his articles accessible  but with a notice referring to the magazine s ongoing investigation into the fabrications      The Wall Street Journal cited a former Der Spiegel journalist who said  some of the articles at issue appeared to confirm certain German stereotypes about Trump voters  asking  was this possible because of ideological bias        An apology ensued from Der Spiegel for looking for a clich  of a Trump voting town  and not finding it      Mathias Br ckers  former Die Tageszeitung editor  wrote   the imaginative author simply delivered what his superiors demanded and fit into their spin       The Atlantic claimed that  Der Spiegel has long peddled crude and sensational anti Americanism           The Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin described the magazine as a  resource of offal         Bans edit  A special    March      edition of Der Spiegel on Islam was banned in Egypt in April      for publishing material deemed by authorities to be  insulting Islam and the Prophet Muhammed           Head
