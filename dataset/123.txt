in       Another early agency  started by James  Jem  White in      at Fleet Street  London  eventually evolved into White Bull Holmes  a recruitment advertising agency  that went out of business in the late     s        In      George Reynell  an officer at the London Gazette  set up another of the early advertising agencies  also in London     This remained a family business until       as  Reynell   Son   and is now part of the TMP Worldwide agency  UK and Ireland  under the brand TMP Reynell     Another early agency that traded until recently  was founded by Charles Barker  and the firm he established traded as  Barkers  until      when it went into Administration  Volney B  Palmer opened the first American advertising agency  in Philadelphia in       This agency placed ads produced by its clients in various newspapers     In      Mathew Brady created the first modern advertisement when he placed an ad in the New York Herald paper offering to produce  photographs  ambrotypes  and daguerreotypes   His ads were the first whose typeface and fonts were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements  At that time all newspaper ads were set in agate and only agate  His use of larger distinctive fonts caused a sensation     Later that same year Robert E  Bonner ran the first full page ad in a newspaper     In       William James Carlton began selling advertising space in religious magazines  In       Francis Ayer  at the age of     created the first full service advertising agency in Philadelphia  called N W  Ayer   Son  It was the oldest advertising agency in America and dissolved in       James Walter Thompson joined Carlton s firm in       Thompson rapidly became their best salesman  purchasing the company in      and renaming it the James Walter Thompson Company  Realizing that he could sell more space if the company provided the service of developing content for advertisers  Thompson hired writers and artists to form the first known Creative Department in an advertising agency  He is credited as the  father of modern magazine advertising  in the US     Advertising Age commemorated the first     years of the agency in       noting that its   history and expansion overseas seems peculiarly to match the whole history of modern advertising       Global advertising agency Globalization of advertising originates in earlier days of the twentieth century  American advertising agencies began as the process of opening overseas offices before the two World Wars and accelerated their globalization throughout the latter part of the twentieth century  McCann Erickson   an agency established in New York City in       opened its first European offices by       It was followed up with offices opening in South America in      and in Australia in          Companies such as J  Walter Thompson adopted a strategy to expand in order to provide the advertising services wherever clients operated  In the     s and     s  English agencies began to realize the overseas opportunities associated with globalization     Expanding overseas gives potential to wider markets   Client relationships Studies show that successful advertising agencies tend to have a shared sense of purpose with their clients through collaboration  This includes a common set of client objectives where agencies feel a shared sense of ownership of the strategic process  Successful advertisements start with clients building a good relationship with the agencies and work together to figure out what their objectives are  Clients must trust the agencies to do their jobs correctly and accordingly with the resources they have provided  Breakdowns in relationships were more likely to occur when agencies felt undermined  subjugated or even feel they don t have an equal status  Traditionally advertising agencies tend to be in a position to take the lead on projects    but results are best when there is a more collaborative relationship  Stronger collaboration happens in situations where a personal chemistry has been established between both parties  Finding out similar likes and dislikes  points of view and even hobbies and passions  Personal chemistry builds with the length of the client relationship  frequency of meetings  and how far mutual respect goes between parties  This was one trait that advertising agencies were perceived to not always have  It was suggested that on occasions  media planners and researchers were more closely involved in the project because of their personal relationships with their clients     Successful strategic planning is best when both parties are involved due to the bond between sides by understanding each other s views and mindset  Involved advertising account planners are seen to contribute towards successful agency client collaboration  Planners of advertising agencies tend to be capable of creating a very powerful  trusting relationship with their clients because they were seen as intellectual prowess  seniority and have empathy in the creative process   Agencies All advertising agencies are called that because they are acting as agents for their principals which were the media  They were then  and are now  paid by the media to sell advertising space to clients  Originally  in the   th century  and the first half of the   th  advertising agencies made all of their income from commissions paid by the media for selling space to the client    Although it is still the case that the majority of their income comes from the media  in the middle of the   th century  agencies began to offer additional services which they sold directly to the client  Such services can include writing the text of the advertisement      Creativity Some agencies who   believe there is only one rule for advertising to be effective   it has to be creative   Even more than the visual presentation or wording  most agencies seek innovative ways to pass on the message s  to consumers  Success comes when agencies are able to be creative enough to break through the targets  mindset and ignite a brand relationship  Advertising agencies can either play it safe and risk losing the marketing war or can try to constantly come up with fresh ideas  citation needed  Use of creativity by agencies is  unexpected  because so much advertising today is expected   This will capture the attention of audiences  therefore the message is more likely to get through  There have been many advertisements that have surprised audiences because it was not normal for them to see that in an advertisement of that nature  The best use of creativity is when the agencies make consumers think about the product or brand  The type of creativity is distinctive communication which is breaking through the clutter       Commission rates for advertising agencies This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this
