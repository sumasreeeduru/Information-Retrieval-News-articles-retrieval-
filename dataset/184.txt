nch o  was the second imperial dynasty of China      BC       AD   established by the rebel leader Liu Bang and ruled by the House of Liu   Preceded by the short lived Qin dynasty          BC  and a warring interregnum known as the Chu Han contention          BC   it was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty       AD  established by the usurping regent Wang Mang  and was separated into two periods the Western Han      BC   AD  and the Eastern Han         AD   before being succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period          AD    Spanning over four centuries  the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history  and influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since     Modern China s majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the  Han Chinese   the Sinitic language is known as  Han language   and the written Chinese is referred to as  Han characters      The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society  He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class  The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies  and a number of semi autonomous kingdoms  These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence  particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States  From the reign of Emperor Wu  r         BC  onward  the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics  synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu  This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in      AD  The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty  c           BC   The coinage issued by the central government mint in     BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty          AD   The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations  To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories  the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in     BC  but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty  Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances  including the process of papermaking  the nautical steering ship rudder  the use of negative numbers in mathematics  the raised relief map  the hydraulic powered armillary sphere for astronomy  and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes  The Xiongnu  a nomadic steppe confederation     defeated the Han in     BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior and vassal partner for several decades  but continued their military raids on the Han borders  Emperor Wu launched several military campaigns against them  The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries  These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty and control into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia  divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations  and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road  which reached as far as the Mediterranean world  The territories north of Han s borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation  Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south  annexing Nanyue in     BC and Dian in     BC  and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in     BC  After    AD  the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in court politics  engaging in violent power struggles between the various consort clans of the empresses and empresses dowager  causing the Han s ultimate downfall  Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large Daoist religious societies which instigated the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion  Following the death of Emperor Ling  r          AD   the palace eunuchs suffered wholesale massacre by military officers  allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire  When Cao Pi  king of Wei  usurped the throne from Emperor Xian  the Han dynasty

Qin dynasty          BC   The Qin united the Chinese Warring States by conquest  but their regime became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huang  Within four years  the dynasty s authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion     Two former rebel leaders  Xiang Yu  d      BC  of Chu and Liu Bang  d      BC  of Han  engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China  which had fissured into    kingdoms  each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang     Although Xiang Yu proved to be an effective commander  Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia      BC   in modern day Anhui  Liu Bang assumed the title  emperor   huangdi  at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu  r          BC       Chang an  known today as Xi an  was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han        Thirteen direct controlled commanderies including the capital region  Yellow  and ten semi autonomous kingdoms of the early periods      BC At the beginning of the Western Han  traditional Chinese      simplified Chinese      pinyin  X h n   also known as the Former Han  traditional Chinese      simplified Chinese      pinyin  Qi nh n  dynasty  thirteen centrally controlled commanderies including the capital region existed in the western third of the empire  while the eastern two thirds were divided into ten semi autonomous kingdoms      To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu  Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings   By     BC  the Han court had replaced all but one of these kings  the exception being in Changsha  with royal Liu family members  since the loyalty of non relatives to the throne was questioned      After several insurrections by Han kings the largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in     BC the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in     BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies      Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff  this duty was assumed by the imperial court      Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes      The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han      To the north of China proper  the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu  r          BC  conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe  By the end of his reign  he controlled Manchuria  Mongolia  and the Tarim Basin  subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand      Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders  and he established a trade embargo against the group      In retaliation  the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province  where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in     BC      After negotiations  the heqin agreement in     BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance  but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes  food  and wine to the Xiongnu      Despite the tribute and a negotiation between Laoshang Chanyu  r          BC  and Emperor Wen  r          BC  to reopen border markets  many of the Chanyu s Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods      In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu  r         BC  in     BC  the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement  Emperor Wu accepted this  despite continuing Xiongnu raids      However  a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han      When this plot failed in     BC      Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory  The assault culminated in     BC at the Battle of Mobei  where the Han commanders Huo Qubing  d      BC  and Wei Qing  d      BC  forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert      After Wu s reign  Han forces continued to prevail against the Xiongnu  The Xiongnu leader Huhanye Chanyu  r        BC  finally submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in    BC  His rival claimant to the throne  Zhizhi Chanyu  r        BC   was killed by Chen Tang and Gan Yanshou           at the Battle of Zhizhi  in modern Taraz  Kazakhstan        Map showing the expansion of Han dynasty in the  nd century BC In     BC  Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur  They repelled a joint Xiongnu Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in     BC  In that year  the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region  Jiuquan  Zhangyi  Dunhuang  and Wuwei      The majority of people on the frontier were soldiers      On occasion  the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements  along with government owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor      The court also encouraged commoners  such as farmers  merchants  landowners  and hired laborers  to voluntarily migrate to the frontier        The ruins of a Han dynasty watchtower made of rammed earth at Dunhuang  Gansu province  the eastern edge of the Silk Road  Even before Han s expansion into Central Asia  diplomat Zhang Qian s travels from     to     BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations  Zhang encountered Dayuan  Fergana   Kangju  Sogdiana   and Daxia  Bactria  formerly the Greco Bactrian Kingdom   he also gathered information on Shendu  Indus River valley of North India  and Anxi  the Parthian Empire   All of these countries eventually received Han embassies      These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire  bringing Han items like silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China      From roughly     to    BC  Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis city states in the Tarim Basin  Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in    BC  which dealt with the region s defense and foreign affairs      The Han also expanded southward  The naval conquest of Nanyue in     BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong  Guangxi  and northern Vietnam  Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in     BC  followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the Han conquest of Gojoseon and colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in     BC      In China s first known nationwide census taken in   AD  the population was registered as having            individuals in            households     To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion  Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries  He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants  These monopolies included salt  iron  and liquor production  as well as bronze coin currency  The liquor monopoly lasted only from    to    BC  and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han  The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty      The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court  The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu s reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang  d     BC   The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy  The Reformists  however  overturned these policies  favoring a cautious  non expansionary approach to foreign policy  frugal budget reform  and lower tax rates imposed on private entrepreneurs       Wang Mang s reign and

BC   AD       When Ping died on   February   AD  Ruzi Ying  d     AD  was chosen as the heir and Wang Mang was appointed to serve as acting emperor for the child      Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he came of age      Despite this promise  and against protest and revolts from the nobility  Wang Mang claimed on    January that the divine Mandate of Heaven called for the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of his own  the Xin dynasty       AD       Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful  These reforms included outlawing slavery  nationalizing land to equally distribute between households  and introducing new currencies  a change which debased the value of coinage      Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition  Wang s regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c    AD and    AD  Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works  The Yellow River split into two new branches  one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula  though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by    AD      The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers  many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the Red Eyebrows to survive      Wang Mang s armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups  Eventually  an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang      The Gengshi Emperor  r        AD   a descendant of Emperor Jing  r          BC

executed their leaders for treason      From    until    AD  Emperor Guangwu had to wage war against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor  when these warlords were defeated  China

Korean commanderies  Han did not reaffirm its control over the region until AD         The Tr ng Sisters of Vietnam rebelled against Han in AD     Their rebellion was crushed by Han general Ma Yuan  d  AD     in a campaign from AD            Wang Mang renewed hostilities against the Xiongnu  who were estranged from Han until their leader Bi      a rival claimant to the throne against his cousin Punu       submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in AD     This created two rival Xiongnu states  the Southern Xiongnu led by Bi  an ally of Han  and the Northern Xiongnu led by Punu  an enemy of Han      During the turbulent reign of Wang Mang  China lost control over the Tarim Basin  which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD    and used as a base to invade the Hexi Corridor in Gansu      Dou Gu  d     AD  defeated the Northern Xiongnu at the Battle of Yiwulu in AD     evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake Barkol before establishing a garrison at Hami      After the

Dou Xian  d  AD     defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the Altai Mountains      After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD     the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from the borders of the Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people      The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai        d  AD       who consistently defeated Chinese armies  However  Tanshihuai s confederation disintegrated after his death      Ban Chao  d  AD      enlisted the aid of the Kushan Empire  occupying the area of modern India  Pakistan  Afghanistan  and Tajikistan  to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana      When a request by Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises  r  c     c      AD  for a marriage alliance with the Han was rejected in AD     he sent his forces to Wakhan  Afghanistan  to attack Ban Chao  The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies      In AD     the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao        Eastern Han inscriptions on a lead ingot  using barbarous Greek alphabet in the style of the Kushans  excavated in Shaanxi   st

addition to tributary relations with the Kushans  the Han Empire received gifts from the Parthian Empire  from a king in modern Burma  from a ruler in Japan  and initiated an unsuccessful mission to

 r        AD  reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house      Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans      In    AD  with the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong  d      AD   Emperor He  r         AD  had Empress Dowager Dou  d     AD  put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power  This was in revenge for Dou s purging of the clan of his natural mother Consort Liang and then concealing her identity from him      After Emperor He s death  his wife Empress Deng Sui  d      AD  managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from     to     AD        When Empress Dowager Deng died  Emperor An  r          AD  was convinced by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run      and Jiang Jing      that Deng and her family had planned to depose him  An dismissed Deng s clan members from office  exiled them and forced many to commit suicide      After An s death  his wife  Empress Dowager Yan  d      AD  placed the child Marquess of Beixiang on the throne in an attempt to retain power within her family  However  palace eunuch Sun Cheng  d      AD  masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han  r

Liang Ji  who was then forced to commit suicide      Students from the Imperial University organized a widespread student protest against the eunuchs of Emperor Huan s court      Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem at a time of economic crisis      Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying      and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason  In     AD  the Grand Commandant Dou Wu  d      AD  convinced his son in law  Emperor Huan  to release them      However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office  marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions      Following Huan s death  Dou Wu and the Grand Tutor

other  When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu  he was forced to commit suicide      Under Emperor Ling  r          AD  the eunuchs had the partisan prohibitions renewed and expanded  while also auctioning off top government offices      Many affairs of state were entrusted to the eunuchs Zhao Zhong  d      AD  and Zhang Rang  d      AD  while Emperor Ling spent much of his time roleplaying with concubines and participating in military parades       End of the Han dynasty edit  Main article  End of the Han dynasty The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in     AD  largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions      The Yellow Turbans and Five Pecks of Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue  d      AD  and Zhang Lu  d      AD   respectively

a regent such as the empress dowager or one of her male relatives      Ranked immediately below the emperor were the kings who were of the same Liu family clan      The rest of society  including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks  ershi gongcheng        Each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges  The highest rank  of full marquess  came with a state pension and a territorial fiefdom  Holders of the rank immediately below  that of ordinary marquess  received a pension  but had no territorial rule       Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige  The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses       By the Eastern Han period  local elites of unattached scholars  teachers  students  and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger  nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship       When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid to late Eastern Han  many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office       The farmer  or specifically the small landowner cultivator  was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy  Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status  such as tenants  wage laborers  and slaves       The Han dynasty made adjustments to slavery in China and saw an increase in agricultural slaves  Artisans  technicians  tradespeople and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner cultivator farmers and common merchants       State registered merchants  who were forced by law to wear white colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes  were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status       These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces  merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials       Wealthy landowners  such as nobles and officials  often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties  sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle  Unlike slaves  retainers could come and go from their master s home as they pleased       Medical physicians  pig breeders  and butchers had a fairly

province  China The Han era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household  Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house  unlike families of later dynasties       According to Confucian family norms  various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy  For example  there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle       Marriages were highly ritualized  particularly for the wealthy  and included many important steps  The giving of betrothal gifts  known as bridewealth and dowry  were especially important  A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife  but as a concubine       Arranged marriages were normal  with the father s input on his offspring s spouse being considered more important than the mother s       Monogamous marriages were also normal  although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers       Under certain conditions dictated by custom  not law  both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry       However  a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband s family after his death  In order to remarry  the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee  Her children would not be allowed to go with her        Left image  A Han pottery female servant in silk robes Right image  A Han pottery female dancer in silk robes Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks  inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture  each son received an equal share of the family property       Unlike the practice in later dynasties  the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune       Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries  though this was usually much less than the shares of sons       A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will  but it is unclear how common this was       Women were expected to obey the will of their father  then their husband  and then their adult son in old age  However  it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule  especially in regard to mothers over their sons  and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers       Women were exempt from the annual corv e labor duties  but often engaged in a range of income earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning       The most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family  sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women  Other women helped on their brothers  farms or became singers  dancers  sorceresses  respected medical physicians  and successful merchants who could

ministers  Nevertheless  emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences       Below the emperor were his cabinet members known as the Three Councillors of State  San

appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom  kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs       However  in     BC  after several insurrections by the kings  Emperor Jing removed the kings  rights to appoint officials whose salaries were higher than     bushels       The Imperial Counselors and Nine Ministers  excluding the Minister Coachman  of every kingdom were abolished  although the Chancellor was still appointed by the central government       With these reforms  kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs  gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom       Similarly  the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess s fief were appointed by the central government  A marquess s Chancellor was

of the Han tax base  this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords       The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner cultivators out of debt and on their own farms  These reforms included reducing taxes  temporary remissions of taxes  granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts       In     BC  the land tax rate was reduced from one fifteenth of a farming household s crop yield to one thirtieth       and later to a one hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty  The consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes       The labor tax took the form of conscripted labor for one month per year  which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty six  This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax  since hired labor became more popular        Private manufacture and government monopolies edit   A Han dynasty iron Ji  halberd  and iron dagger In the early Western Han  a wealthy salt or iron industrialist  whether a semi autonomous king or wealthy merchant  could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand  This kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue       To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs  Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in     BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the state monopolies       By Eastern Han times  the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations  as well as private businessmen       Liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in    BC  However  this was repealed in    BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every     L       gallons  was levied for those who traded it privately       By     BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants       Apart from Emperor Ming s creation of a short lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization  which was abolished in    AD  central government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han

Dou Wan  wife of Liu Sheng  King of Zhongshan  its sliding shutter allows for adjustments in the direction and brightness in light while it also traps smoke within the body       The Han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern Chinese science and technology  comparable to the level of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty                   Writing materials edit  In the  st millennium BC  typical ancient Chinese writing materials were bronzewares  animal bones  and bamboo slips or wooden boards  By the beginning of the Han dynasty  the chief writing materials were clay tablets  silk cloth  hemp paper            and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string  these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps       The oldest known Chinese piece of hempen paper dates to the  nd century BC            The standard papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun  AD         in           The oldest known surviving piece of paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a Han watchtower that had been abandoned in AD      in Inner Mongolia        Metallurgy and agriculture edit   An array of

to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast  were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period          BC        The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China  however  the Han era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization       Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process       The Han dynasty Chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons  culinary tools  carpenters  tools and domestic wares       A significant product of these improved iron smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools  The three legged iron seed drill  invented by the  nd century BC  enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand       The heavy moldboard iron plow  also invented during the Han dynasty  required only one man to control it  two oxen to pull it  It had three plowshares  a seed box for the drills  a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly        m        acres  of land in a single day       To protect crops from wind and drought  the grain intendant Zhao Guo      created the alternating fields system  daitianfa      during Emperor Wu s reign  This system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons       Once experiments with this system yielded successful results  the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it       Han farmers also used the pit field system  aotian     for growing crops  which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain       In southern and small parts of central Han era China  paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice  while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production        Structural and geotechnical engineering edit  Further information  Han dynasty tomb architecture Left

vaulted tomb chamber at Luoyang made of small bricks Timber was the chief building material during the Han dynasty  it was used to build palace halls  multi story residential towers and halls and single story houses       Because wood decays rapidly  the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles       The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the Tang dynasty  AD                Architectural historian Robert L  Thorp points out the scarcity of Han era archaeological remains  and claims that often unreliable Han era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture       Though Han wooden structures decayed  some Han dynasty ruins made of brick  stone  and rammed earth remain intact  This includes stone pillar gates  brick tomb chambers  rammed earth city walls  rammed earth and brick beacon towers  rammed earth sections of the Great Wall  rammed earth platforms where elevated halls once stood  and two rammed earth castles in Gansu       The ruins of rammed earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang an and Luoyang still stand  along with their drainage systems of brick arches  ditches  and ceramic water pipes       Monumental stone pillar gates  twenty nine of which survive from the Han period  formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites       These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles  eaves  and balustrades       The courtyard house is the most common type of home portrayed in Han artwork       Ceramic architectural models of buildings  like houses and towers  were found in Han tombs  perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife  These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture  The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites       Over ten Han era underground tombs have been found  many of them featuring archways  vaulted chambers  and domed roofs       Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits       The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown       From Han literary sources  it is known that wooden trestle beam bridges  arch bridges  simple suspension bridges  and floating pontoon bridges existed in Han China       However  there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature       and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge       Underground mine shafts  some reaching depths over     metres      ft   were created for the extraction of metal ores       Borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt  The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines       These boreholes perhaps reached a depth of     m       ft         Mechanical and hydraulic engineering edit  Han era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them       Professional artisan engineers  jiang    did not leave behind detailed records of their work       Han scholars  who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering  sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described       Nevertheless  some Han literary sources provide crucial information   For example  in    BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine  which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing       The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital       Around AD      Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings       Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world s first known zoetrope lamp         A Han dynasty pottery model of two men operating a winnowing machine with a crank handle and a tilt hammer used to pound grain  Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources  As observed in Han miniature tomb models  but not in literary sources  the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff       The odometer cart  invented during Han  measured journey lengths  using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled       This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the  nd century  yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the  rd century       Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty  for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements  These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured  These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources       The waterwheel appeared in Chinese records during the Han  As mentioned by Huan Tan about AD     they were used to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers  and were used in pounding  threshing and polishing grain       However  there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the  th century       The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi  d     AD  created a waterwheel powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron       Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches  The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his  st century Balanced Discourse       The armillary sphere  a three dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere  was invented in Han China by the  st century BC       Using a water clock  waterwheel and a series of gears  the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng  AD         was able to mechanically rotate his metal ringed armillary sphere       To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock  Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel         A modern replica of Zhang Heng s seismometer Zhang also invented a device he termed an  earthquake weathervane   houfeng didong yi         which the British biochemist  sinologist  and historian Joseph Needham described as  the ancestor of all seismographs        This device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away       It employed an inverted pendulum that  when disturbed by ground tremors  would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths  representing all eight directions  into a metal toad s mouth       The account of this device in the Book of the Later Han describes how  on one occasion  one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance   Several days later  a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery  in modern Gansu Province   the direction the device had indicated  which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang s device        Mathematics edit  Further information  Chinese mathematics   Han mathematics Three Han mathematical treatises still exist  These are the Book on Numbers and Computation  the Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art  Han era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right angle triangles  square roots  cube roots  and matrix methods       finding more accurate approximations for pi       providing mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem       use of the decimal fraction       Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations       and continued fractions to find the roots of equations       One of the Han s greatest mathematical advancements was the world s first use of negative numbers  Negative numbers first appeared in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods  where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods       Negative numbers were also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus around AD      and in the  th century Bakhshali manuscript of Gandhara  South Asia       but were not widely accepted in Europe until the   th century       The Han applied mathematics to various diverse disciplines  In musical tuning  Jing Fang        BC  realized that    perfect fifths was approximate to    octaves while creating a musical scale of    tones  calculating the difference at                the same value of    equal temperament discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator              i e                  Astronomy edit  Further information  Chinese astronomy Mathematics were essential in drafting the astronomical calendar  a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time markers throughout the year       During the spring and autumn periods of the  th century BC  the Chinese established the Sifen calendar         which measured the tropical year at        days  This was replaced in     BC with the Taichu calendar       that measured the tropical year at             days and the lunar month at         days       However  Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar       Han Chinese astronomers made star catalogues and detailed records of comets that appeared in the night sky  including recording the    BC appearance of the comet now known as Halley s Comet       Han dynasty astronomers adopted a geocentric model of the universe  theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding the earth in the center       They assumed that the Sun  Moon  and planets were spherical and not disc shaped  They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight  that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon  and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth       Although others disagreed with his model  Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds        Cartography  ships  and vehicles edit   An early Western Han dynasty silk map found in tomb   of Mawangdui  depicting the Kingdom of Changsha and Kingdom of Nanyue in southern China  note  the south direction is oriented at the top   Evidence found in Chinese literature  and archaeological evidence  show that cartography existed in China before the Han       Some of the earliest Han maps discovered were ink penned silk maps found amongst the Mawangdui Silk Texts in a  nd century BC tomb       The general Ma Yuan created the world s first known raised relief map from rice in the  st century       This date could be revised if the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang is excavated and the account in the Records of the Grand Historian concerning a model map of the empire is proven to be true       Although the use of the graduated scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu  AD           there is evidence that in the early  nd century  cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps         An Eastern Han dynasty pottery boat model with a steering rudder at the stern and anchor at the bow  Han dynasty Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras  such as the tower ship  The junk design was developed and realized during the Han era  Junk ships featured a square ended bow and stern  a flat bottomed hull or carvel shaped hull with no keel or sternpost  and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels       Moreover  Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern  in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport   allowing them to sail on the high seas       Although ox carts and chariots were previously used in China  the wheelbarrow was first used in Han China in the  st century BC       Han artwork of horse drawn chariots shows that the Warring States Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse s chest was replaced by the softer breast strap       Later  during the Northern Wei            the fully developed horse collar was invented        Medicine edit  Further information  Traditional Chinese medicine   Han dynasty  The physical exercise chart  a painting on silk depicting the practice of Qigong Taiji  unearthed in      in Hunan Province  China  from the  nd century BC Western Han burial site of Mawangdui  Tomb Number    Han era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe  namely the cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the five phases  Each organ of the body was associated with a particular phase  Illness was viewed as a sign that qi or  vital energy  channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted  Thus  Han era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance       For example  since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase  medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase       Besides dieting  Han physicians also prescribed moxibustion  acupuncture  and calisthenics as methods of maintaining one s health       When surgery was performed by the Chinese physician Hua Tuo  d  AD       he used anesthesia to numb his patients  pain and prescribed a rubbing ointment that allegedly sped the process of healing surgical wounds       Whereas the physician Zhang Zhongjing  c  AD     c       is known to have written the Shanghan lun   Dissertation on Typhoid Fever    it is thought that both he and Hua Tuo collaborated in compiling the Shennong
