       Circular reporting  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search  Citogenesis  redirects here  It is not to be confused with cytogenesis  A problem where a source gets info from somewhere  that then uses that source as a reference  Two basic ways that circular reporting can happen  Dashed lines indicate sourcing that is not visible to the final reviewer   In both cases  one original source  top  appears to the final reviewer  bottom  as two independent sources  Circular reporting  false confirmation  or citogenesis is a situation in source criticism where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources  but in reality comes from only one source        In many cases  the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy intelligence gathering practices  However  at other times the situation can be intentionally contrived by the original source as a way of reinforcing the widespread belief in its information     This problem occurs in a variety of fields  including intelligence gathering     journalism  and scholarly research  It is of particular concern in military intelligence because the original source has a higher likelihood of wanting to pass on misinformation  and because the chain of reporting is more prone to being obscured  The case of the      Niger uranium forgeries was a classic instance of circular reporting by intelligence agencies      Contents    Examples involving Wikipedia   Examples outside of Wikipedia   See also   References   Examples involving Wikipedia edit  See also  Wikipedia List of citogenesis incidents and Wikipedia List of hoaxes on Wikipedia  Diagram illustrating circular reporting by Wikipedia and the press Wikipedia is sometimes criticized for being used as a source of circular reporting        Wikipedia advises researchers and journalists to be wary of  and generally avoid  using Wikipedia as a direct source  and instead focus on verifiable information found in an article s cited references     In the following examples  false claims were propagated on Wikipedia and in news sources because of circular reporting  Randall Munroe  in his comic xkcd  called this phenomenon citogenesis      Wikipedia and The Northern Echo  In January      a statement was anonymously added to the Wikipedia page on UK comedian broadcaster Dave Gorman stating that  he had taken a career break for a sponsored hitch hike around the Pacific Rim countries   When this was questioned  an article published at a later date  September       in The Northern Echo  a daily regional newspaper in North East England was cited as evidence  The falsity of the original claim was confirmed by Gorman in an episode of his UK TV show Modern Life Is Goodish  first broadcast    November           Wikipedia and Der Spiegel in       regarding Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg name      Wikipedia and The Independent in       propagating the false information that Sacha Baron Cohen worked at Goldman Sachs      Wikipedia on the coati beginning in       when an arbitrary addition  also known as    the Brazilian aardvark  by an American student resulted in much subsequent citation and usage of the unsubstantiated nickname as part of the general consensus  including published articles in The Independent      the Daily Express      the Metro      The Daily Telegraph      the Daily Mail  and a book published by the University of Chicago      and a scholarly work published by Cambridge University      Wikipedia and the BBC in       regarding the Casio F   W watch  KSNV cited this incident as another example of citogenesis  Initially  a      release year was incorrectly inserted into the article in March       Communications with primary sources repeatedly confirmed a      release year  The incorrect year of      was later repeated in a BBC article  with KSNV suspecting its use of      to be derived from Wikipedia  In conjunction with the primary communications being deemed unreliable  the BBC s use of      being treated as reliable made the misinformation difficult to remove      The correct year was only restored in       with KSNV s article becoming the source cited in the article to support the      release date  Examples outside of Wikipedia edit  The identification of Shehroze Chaudhry as an active member of the Islamic State who participated in the killing of several individuals was identified as an instance of circular reporting involving The New York Times  among others       See also edit  External video How false news can spread   Noah
