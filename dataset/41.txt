McCombs and Donald Shaw in a study on the      American presidential election  Agenda setting is a social science theory  it also attempts to make predictions  The theory also suggests that media has a great influence to their audience by instilling what they should think about  instead of what they actually think  That is  if a news item is covered frequently and prominently  the audience will regard the issue as more important   Early research edit  The history of study of agenda setting can be traced to the first chapter of Walter Lippmann s      book  Public Opinion      In that chapter   The World Outside And The Pictures In Our Heads   Lippmann argues that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public  Without using the term  agenda setting   Walter Lippmann was writing about what we today would call  agenda setting   Following Lippmann  in       Bernard Cohen observed that the press  may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think  but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about  The world will look different to different people   Cohen continues   depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers  editors  and publishers of the paper they read      As early as the     s  Cohen had expressed the idea that later led to formalization of agenda setting theory by McCombs and Shaw  The stories with the strongest agenda setting influence tend to be those that involve conflict  terrorism  crime and drug issues within the United States  Those that don t include or involve the United States and politics associate negatively with public opinion  In turn  there is less concern  Although Maxwell McCombs already had some interest in the field  he was exposed to Cohen s work while serving as a faculty member at UCLA  and it was Cohen s work that heavily influenced him  and later Donald Shaw     The concept of agenda setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the      presidential election in Chapel Hill  North Carolina  They examined Lippmann s idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on the media agenda with key issues on the undecided voters  agenda  They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of the news agenda is highly correlated to that of the voters  agenda  McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on the public agenda  The empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories        A relatively unknown scholar named G  Ray Funkhouser performed a study highly similar to McCombs and Shaw s around the same time the authors were formalizing the theory      All three scholars   McCombs  Shaw  and Funkhouser   even presented their findings at the same academic conference  Funkhouser s article was published later than McCombs and Shaw s  and Funkhouser doesn t receive as much credit as McCombs and Shaw for discovering agenda setting  According to Everett Rogers  there are two main reasons for this     First  Funkhouser didn t formally name the theory  Second  Funkhouser didn t pursue his research much past the initial article  Rogers also suggests that Funkhouser was geographically isolated at Stanford  cut off from interested researchers  whereas McCombs and Shaw had got other people interested in agenda setting research   Development of  Agenda setting theory  edit  In the       Chapel Hill study   McCombs and Shaw demonstrated a strong correlation coefficient  r       between what     residents of Chapel Hill  North Carolina thought was the most important election issue and what the local and national news media reported was the most important issue     By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public s perceptions of the most important election issue  McCombs and Shaw were able to determine the degree to which the media determines public opinion  Since the      study  published in a      edition of Public Opinion Quarterly  more than     studies have been published on the agenda setting function of the mass media  and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant     models of agenda setting edit    See also  Mass communications field of study  Influence of mass media  and Schema There are following   models of analyzing  the effect of agenda setting        Awareness model   Priorities model   Salience model  The research on the effect of agenda setting compares the salience of issues in news content with the public perceptions of the most important issue  and then analyses the extent of influence by guidance of the media  There are three models by Max McCombs  the  awareness model   the  priorities model  and the  salience model   Most investigations are centered on these three models     Different media have different agenda setting potential  From the perspective of agenda setting  the analysis of the relationship between traditional media and new virtual spaces has witnessed growing momentum  One of the most critical aspects in the concept of an agenda setting role of mass communication is the time frame for this phenomenon      Most researches on agenda setting are based on the following         the press and the media do not reflect reality  they filter and shape it  media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues    types of agenda setting  Policy makers  Media and Audience edit    See also  Political warfare  Media bias  Yellow journalism  Sensationalism  and Public relations Spin Research shows that the media agenda  audience agenda and policy agenda influence the agenda setting as described in the following section  Rogers and Dearing describe how following types of agenda setting  dependent variable in research  are influenced by other factors       Policy agenda setting  or  Political agenda setting   this model of study focuses on how the elite policy makers  agendas are influenced by other factors  i e  policy makers  agenda is treated as the dependent variable   Media agenda setting  or  Agenda building   this model of study focuses on how the media s agenda is influenced by other factors  i e  media s agenda is treated as the dependent variable   Public Audience agenda setting    this model of study  which is also the traditional hypothesis  focuses on how the audience or public s agenda is influenced by other factors such as personal  religious  and cultural values  i e  public agenda is treated as the dependent variable  Studies have shown that what the media decides to expose correlates with their views on things such as politics  economy and culture  Aside from bias  other critics of the news media claim that news in the United States has become a form of entertainment  Instead of providing the public with the information they need  journalists instead strive to fill the publics  appetite for shocking and sensational headlines      Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure  Financial resources  technologies  foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality     Mass communication research  Rogers and Dearing argue  has focused a great deal on  public agenda setting   e g  McCombs and Shaw        and  media agenda setting   but has largely ignored  policy agenda setting   which is studied primarily by political scientists  As such  the authors suggest mass communication scholars pay more attention to how the media and public agendas might influence elite policy maker s agendas  i e  scholars should ask where the President or members of the U S  Congress get their news from and how this affects their policies   Writing in       Walgrave and Van Aelst took up Rogers and Dearing s suggestions  creating a preliminary theory of political agenda setting  which examines factors that might influence elite policy makers  agendas       Process of agenda setting  known as accessibility  edit    See also  Political agenda  Political ethics  Demagogue  Media transparency  Media manipulation  and Indoctrination Agenda setting occurs through a cognitive process known as  accessibility           Accessibility implies that the more frequently and prominently the news media cover an issue  the more instances of that issue become accessible in audience s memories  When respondents are asked what the most important problem facing the country is  they answer with the most accessible news issue in memory  which is typically the issue the news media focused on the most  The agenda setting effect is not the result of receiving one or a few messages but is due to the aggregate impact of a very large number of messages  each of which has a different content but all of which deal with the same general issue      Mass media coverage in general and agenda setting in particular also has a powerful impact on what individuals think that other people are thinking         and hence they tend to allocate more importance to issues that have been extensively covered by mass media  This is also called schemata theory  In psychology and cognitive science  a schema  plural schemata or schemas  describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them   Comparison of agenda setting with Policy agenda building edit  As more scholars published articles on agenda setting theories it became evident that the process involves not only active role of media organizations  but also participation of the public         as well as policymakers      Rogers and Dearing described the difference between agenda setting and agenda building based on the dominant role of media or public  Thus  setting  an agenda refers to the effect of the media agenda on society     transfer of the media agenda to the public agenda      while  building  an agenda includes  some degree of reciprocity  between the mass media and society     where both media and public agendas influence public policy     According to Sun Young Lee and Daniel Riffe  the agenda building theory speculates that the media does not operate within a vacuum  The media agenda in fact is the result of the influences that certain powerful groups exert as a subtle form of social control  Journalists have limited time and limited resources that can contribute to external sources getting involved in the news media s gatekeeping process  and some scholars have attempted to reveal certain relationships between information sources and the agenda the news media has made up  probing who builds the media agenda  There are multiple sources that can participate in this agenda building process through various different ways  but researchers have been the most interested in the effectiveness of information aids such as media kits and press releases within the news media agenda  and this is a measure of the success of organizations public relations efforts  Berkowitz has implemented a more nuanced analysis of agenda setting and agenda building theories by introducing the terms policy agenda setting and policy agenda building      He argues that when scholars investigate only the linkage between media and policymakers  it is still appropriate to use the notion of policy agenda setting      However  when the focus is placed not only on policymakers  personal agendas  but also on the broader salient issues where media represent only one indicator of public sentiment  Berkowitz suggests talking about policy agenda building       Agenda building edit  See also  Political agenda  Political ethics  Political warfare  Demagogue  Indoctrination  Sensationalism  and Public relations Spin The agenda building perspective ascribes importance not only to mass media and policymakers  but also to social process  to mutually interdependent relation between the concerns generated in social environment and the vitality of governmental process  Thus according to Cobb and Elder  the agenda building framework makes allowances for continuing mass involvement and broaden the range of recognized influences on the public policy making process      Although the public does have a place on the list of possibly influencing the media agenda  they are not thought to powerfully shape media agendas  It seems the more correct to argue the possibility that when journalists look to their own interests for story ideas  they are actually trying to predict their audience s needs  This idea of mass involvement has become more prominent with the advent of the Internet and its potential to make everyone a pamphleteer      Increase in the role of citizens in agenda setting sheds light on a new direction in the traditional agenda building research  This is now the case because the general public can now create their own media  Social media has changed the way people view and perceive things in today s world  Mass involvement within social media lets the general publics voices be heard  Comments and reply s give potential for people to address your thoughts or open new doors for conversation  Kim and Lee     noted that the agenda setting research on the Internet differs from traditional agenda setting research with respect that the Internet is in competition with traditional media and has enormous capacity for contents  and users  interactivity  Lee  Lancendorfer and Lee     argued that  various opinions about public issues are posted on the Internet bulletin boards or the Usenet newsgroup by Netizens  and the opinions then form an agenda in which other Netizens can perceive the salient issue   Scholars also stated that the Internet plays role in forming Internet user s opinion as well as the public space  Kim and Lee     studied the pattern of the Internet mediated agenda setting by conducting a case study of    cases that have a great ripple effect in Korea for   years  from      until        Scholars found that a person s opinion could be disseminated through various online channels and could synthesize public opinion that influences news coverage  Their study suggests  reversed agenda effects   meaning that public agenda could set media agenda  Maxwell McCombs     also mentioned  reverse agenda setting  in his recent textbook as a situation where public concern sets the media agenda  According to Kim and Lee      agenda building through the Internet take the following three steps     Internet mediated agenda rippling  an anonymous netizen s opinion spreads to the important agenda in the Internet through online main rippling channels such as blogs  personal homepages  and the Internet bulletin boards     agenda diffusion in the Internet  online news or web sites report the important agenda in the Internet that in turn leads to spreading the agenda to more online publics     Internet mediated reversed agenda setting  traditional media report online agenda to the public so that the agenda spread to both offline and online publics  However  scholars concluded that the Internet mediated agenda setting or agenda building processes not always occur in consecutive order  For example  the agenda that was reported by traditional media can come to the fore again through the online discussion or the three steps can occur simultaneously in a short period of time  Several studies provide evidence that the Internet community  particularly bloggers  can push their own agenda into public agenda  then media agenda  and  eventually  into policy agenda  In the most comprehensive study to date  Wallsten     tracked mainstream media coverage and blog discussion of    issues during the      presidential campaign  Using time series analysis  Wallsten found evidence that journalists discuss the issues that bloggers are blogging about  There are also anecdotal pieces of evidence suggesting bloggers exert an influence on the political agenda  For instance  in      Eason Jordan  the chief news executive at CNN  abruptly resigned after being besieged by the online community after saying  according to various witnesses  that he believed the United States military had aimed at journalists in Iraq and killed    of them      Similarly  in       Trent Lott had to resign as Senate majority leader due to his inappropriate racist remarks that were widely discussed in the blogosphere      However bloggers attract attention not only to oust journalists and politicians  An online investigation on technical problems with electronic voting machines started by an activist Bev Harris in      eventually forced traditional media outlets to address issue of electronic voting malperformance  This in turn made Diebold  a company that produces these machines  to acknowledge its fault and take measures to fix it  Many studies have been performed to test the agenda setting theory within global news coverage  One of the findings determined that foreign news that had any mentions of the United States or the UK  greatly influenced public opinion compared to global news that didn t involve either country       Agenda setting edit  See also  Influence of mass media  Media transparency  Media manipulation  Indoctrination  and Sensationalism Some groups have a greater ease of access than others and are thus more likely to get their demands placed on agenda than others       For instance  policymakers have been found to be more influential than the overall group of news sources because they often better understand journalists  needs for reliable and predictable information and their definition of newsworthiness      Cobb and Elder ascribed even more importance to decision makers  claiming that in order for an issue to attain agenda status  it must be supported by at least some of key decision makers as they act as guardians of the formal agenda       They also asserted that certain personages in the media can act as opinion leaders and bring media coverage to a particular issue      Government affiliated news sources have higher success rates in becoming media agenda and have been found by a number of scholars to be the most frequently appearing of sources at the local  state  and national levels      News sources can also provide definitions of issues  thus determining the terms of future discussion and framing problems in particular ways          As McCombs and Valenzuela stated   We don t need the media to alert us about inflation as routine purchases reveal its presence  But to learn about abstract economic topics such as budget deficits  our main  if not only  source is the news media       What interpretation of  reality  will dominate public discourse has implications for the future of the social problem  for the interest groups and policymakers involved  and for the policy itself       For example  Gusfield argues that the highway deaths associated with alcohol consumption can be interpreted as a problem of irresponsible drunken drivers  insufficient automobile crashworthiness  a transportation system overly dependent on cars  poor highway design  excessive emphasis on drinking in adult social life      Different ways of framing the situation may compete to be accepted as an authoritative version of reality      consequently spurring competition between sources of information for definition of an issue  Very powerful resources of information can even influence whether an issue receives media attention at all      The relationship of media and policymakers is symbiotic and is controlled by shared culture of unofficial set of ground rules as journalists need access to official information and policymakers need media coverage  nevertheless the needs of journalists and policymakers are often incompatible because of their different orientation in time as powerful sources are at their best in routine situations and react more slowly when crisis or disaster occur         Consequently  policymakers who understand the rules of this culture the best will be most capable of setting their agendas and issue definitions      On the other hand  media also influence policymakers when government officials and politicians take the amount of media attention given to an issue as an indirect expression of public interest in the issue      Academic research on agenda setting theory edit    Review studies on agenda setting theory edit  Various critiques have been made of agenda setting theory   Agenda setting is an inherently causal theory  but few studies establish the hypothesized temporal order  the media should set the public s agenda   The measurement of the dependent variable was originally conceptualized as the public s perceived issue  salience   but subsequent studies have conceptualized the dependent variable as awareness  attention  or concern  leading to differing outcomes  Studies tend to aggregate media content categories and public responses into very broad categories  resulting in inflated correlation coefficients     The theory seemed to imply that the audience takes generally passive position  However  the public is not as passive as the theory assumed  Theorist John Fiske has challenged the view of a passive audience      Additional factors to be considered in agenda setting research edit  See also  contingency factors  Impact of media on audience  and  quantum of impact on individuals in audience  edit  In an attempt to overcome mirror image effects of agenda setting that implied direct influence of media agenda on the audience  several scholars proposed that the model of agenda setting should include individual collective audience characteristics or real world conditions that are likely to affect issue importance  They discovered that certain individual and group characteristics are likely to act as contingent conditions of media impact and proposed a model of  audience effects       According to the audience effects model  media coverage interacts with the audience s pre existing sensitivities to produce changes in issue concerns  Thus  media effects are contingent on issue specific audience characteristics      For instance  for high sensitivity audiences who are most affected by a certain issue or a problem  the salience of this issue increases substantially with news exposure  while the same exposure has little effect on other groups  Erbring  Goldenberg and Miller have also demonstrated that people who do not talk about political issues are more subject to agenda setting influence because they depend more heavily on media content than those who receive information from other sources  including their colleagues and friends      Another factor that causes variations in the correlation between the media and public agenda is whether an issue is  obtrusive  or  unobtrusive      i e   whether it has a high or low issue threshold      Obtrusive or issues with low threshold are generally the ones that affect nearly everyone and with which we can have some kind of personal experience  e g  citywide crime or increases in gasoline prices   Because of their link to personal concerns  these issues almost compel attention from political elites as well as the news media  Moreover  with this type of issues the problem would be of general concern even without attention from the news media      Unobtrusive or high threshold issues are those issues that are generally remote from just about everyone  e g   high level wrongdoing  such as the Watergate scandal  plight of Syrian refugees   Research performed by Zucker suggests that an issue is obtrusive if most members of the public have had direct contact with it  and less obtrusive if audience members have not had direct experience  This means that the less direct experience people have with an issue  the greater is the news media s influence on public opinion on that issue             Moreover  unobtrusive or high threshold issues do not pertain into media agenda as quickly as obtrusive issues and therefore require a buildup  which is a function of more than the amount of space or time the media devote to the story  The latter may push the story past the threshold of inattention  but it is also important to look at the kind of coverage to explain how a certain incident becomes an issue       Impact of  personal relevance to individuals  on  individual need for orientation  edit  Agenda setting studies typically show variability in the correlation between media and public agenda  To explain differences in the correlation  McCombs and colleagues created the concept of  need for orientation   which  describes individual differences in the desire for orienting cues and background information   Two concepts  relevance and uncertainty  define an individual s need for orientation  Relevance suggests that an individual will not seek news media information if an issue is not personally relevant  Hence  if relevance is low  people will feel the need for less orientation  There are many issues in our country that are just not relevant to people  because they do not affect us  Many news organizations attempt to frame issues in a way that attempts to make them relevant to its audiences  This is their way of keeping their viewership readership high   Level of uncertainty is the second defining condition of need for orientation  Frequently  individuals already have all the information that they desire about a topic  Their degree of uncertainty is low       When issues are of high personal relevance and uncertainty low  the need to monitor any changes in those issues will be present and there will be a moderate the need for orientation  If at any point in time viewers readers have high relevance and high uncertainty about any type of issue event election campaign there was a high need for orientation  David Weaver             adapted the concept of  individual s need for orientation  defined regarding relevance and uncertainty  Research done by Weaver in      suggested that individuals vary on their need for orientation  Need for orientation is a combination of the individual s interest in the topic and uncertainty about the issue  The higher levels of interest and uncertainty produce higher levels of need for orientation  So the individual would be considerably likely to be influenced by the media stories  psychological aspect of theory       Schonbach and Weaver        focused on need for orientation showed the strongest agenda setting effects at a moderate need for orientation  under conditions of low interest and high uncertainty        Theory development in agenda setting research edit  Second level agenda setting  attribute agenda setting edit   After first level agenda setting effects were established  researchers began to explore a  second level  of agenda setting that examines the influence of attribute salience  or the properties  qualities  and characteristics that describe objects or people in the news and the tone of those attributes   The second level of agenda setting was suggested after research confirmed the effects of the theory   As agenda setting theory was being developed  scholars pointed out many attributes that describe the object  Each of the objects on an agenda has a lot of attributes containing cognitive components such as information that describes characteristics of the object  and an affective component including tones  positive  negative  neutral  of the characteristics on agenda  The agenda setting theory and the second level of agenda setting  framing  are both relevant and similar in demonstrating how society is influenced by media  but they describe a different process of influence  One tells us what information to process and the other tells us how to process that information  Framing theory  an extension of agenda setting  describes how the  stance  an article of media may take can affect the perception of the viewer  It is said that there are two main attributes of the second level of agenda setting  Those include substantive and affective  The substantive factor has to do mainly with things such as personality and ideology  The affective factor is focused on the positive  negative  and neutral side of things  For example  media coverage of a political candidate s experience would be included in the substantive dimension of second level agenda setting  whereas the attitude toward the candidate s experience  positive  negative  or neutral  would be included in the affective dimension        Hierarchy of Effects Theory edit  Coleman and Wu        emphasized the similarities between the hierarchy of effects theory and agenda setting theory  and how the latter can be used to analyze the former  The hierarchy of effects theory has three components  knowledge  attitude  and behavior  also known as  learn  feel  do   The first level of agenda setting  such as a policy issue gaining public attention  corresponds to the  knowledge  component of the hierarchy of effects theory  The second level of agenda setting  such as how the public views or feels about a policy issue  corresponds to the  attitude  component  Coleman and Wu s study is not so much focused on the order of these components  but instead on which component  knowledge  level one  and attitude  level two   has a greater effect on public behavior        Second level agenda setting vs  framing edit  McCombs et al             demonstrated that agenda setting research at the second level deals with the influence of  attribute  salience  whereas the first level agenda setting illustrates the influence of  issue  salience  Balmas and Sheafer             argued that the focus at the first level agenda setting which emphasizes media s role in telling us  what to think about  is shifted to media s function of telling us  how to think about  at the second level agenda setting  The second level of agenda setting considers how the agenda of attributes affects public opinion  McCombs   Evatt         Furthermore  Ghanem            demonstrated that the certain attributes agendas in the news with low psychological distance  drove compelling arguments for the salience of public agenda  The second level agenda setting differs from traditional agenda setting in that it focus on attribute salience  and public s attribute agenda is regarded as one of the important variables  One example that helps illustrate the effects of framing involves president Nixon s involvement in the watergate scandal  According to a study conducted by Lang and Lang  the media coverage at first belittled the watergate scandal and the President s involvement  It wasn t until the story was framed as one of the highest political scandals in US history that the public opinion changed  Lang   Lang        This event depicts how the media personnel have a great deal of power in persuading the public s opinions  It also suggests that framing is a form of gatekeeping  similar to the agenda setting theory      There is a debate over whether framing theory should be subsumed within agenda setting as  second level agenda setting   McCombs  Shaw  Weaver and colleagues generally argue that framing is a part of agenda setting that operates as a  second level  or secondary effect  Dietram Scheufele has argued the opposite  Scheufele argues that framing and agenda setting possess distinct theoretical boundaries  operate via distinct cognitive processes  accessibility vs  attribution   and relate to different outcomes  perceptions of issue importance vs  interpretation of news issue       When talking about the second level of agenda setting  as well as the political aspects of the theory  its pivotal to include priming  Priming is considered to be the step past agenda setting  and is also referred to as the last step of the process  Priming is primarily used in political settings  It discusses how the media will choose to leave some issues about the candidates out of coverage  while presenting other issues in the fore front  This process creates different standards by which the public evaluates candidates  As well  by reporting the issues that have the most salience on the public  they are not objectively presenting both candidates equally   According to Weaver      framing and second level agenda setting have the following characteristics  Similarities   Both are more concerned with how issues or other objects are depicted in the media than with which issues or objects are more or less prominently reported  Both focus on most salient or prominent aspects of themes or descriptions of the objects of interest  Both are concerned with ways of thinking rather than objects of thinking Differences   Framing does seem to include a broader range of cognitive processes   moral evaluations  causal reasoning  appeals to principle  and recommendations for treatment of problems   than does second level agenda setting  the salience of attributes of an object    Scheufele and Tewksbury argue that  framing differs significantly from these accessibility based models  i e   agenda setting and priming   It is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized in news reports can have an influence on how it is understood by audiences       the difference between whether we think about an issue and how we think about it  Framing and agenda setting differ in their functions in the process of news production  information processing and media effects  News production  Although  both frame building and agenda building refer to macroscopic mechanisms that deal with message construction rather than media effects   frame building is more concerned with the news production process than agenda building  In other words   how forces and groups in society try to shape public discourse about an issue by establishing predominant labels is of far greater interest from a framing perspective than from a traditional agenda setting one   News processing  For framing and agenda setting  different conditions seem to be needed in processing messages to produce respective effects  Framing effect is more concerned with audience attention to news messages  while agenda setting is more concerned with repeated exposure to messages  Locus of effect  Agenda setting effects are determined by the ease with which people can retrieve from their memory issues recently covered by mass media  while framing is the extent to which media messages fit ideas or knowledge people have in their knowledge store  Based on these shared characteristics  McCombs and colleagues     recently argued that framing effects should be seen as the extension of agenda setting  In other words  according to them  the premise that framing is about selecting  a restricted number of thematically related attributes       for media representation can be understood as the process of transferring the salience of issue attributes  i e   second level agenda setting   That is  according to McCombs and colleagues  arguments  framing falls under the umbrella of agenda setting   Accessibility  agenda setting  vs  applicability  framing  edit  According to Price and Tewksbury      however  agenda setting and framing are built on different theoretical premises  agenda setting is based on accessibility  while framing is concerned with applicability  i e   the relevance between message features and one s stored ideas or knowledge   Accessibility based explanation of agenda setting is also applied to second level agenda setting  That is  transferring the salience of issue attributes  i e   second level agenda setting  is a function of accessibility  For framing effects  empirical evidence shows that the impact of frames on public perceptions is mainly determined by perceived importance of specific frames rather than by the quickness of retrieving frames      That is  the way framing effects transpires is different from the way second level agenda setting is supposed to take place  i e   accessibility   On a related note  Scheufele and Tewksbury     argues that  because accessibility and applicability vary in their functions of media effects   the distinction between accessibility and applicability effects has obvious benefits for understanding and predicting the effects of dynamic information environments   Taken together  it can be concluded that the integration of framing into agenda setting is either impossible because they are based on different theoretical premises or imprudent because merging the two concepts would result in the loss of our capabilities to explain various media effects   a   Accessibility  Agenda setting  Increasing attention has been devoted to examining how agenda setting occur in terms of their psychological mechanisms  Holbrook   Hill         Price and Tewksbury        argued that agenda setting effects are based on the accessibility model of information processing  Accessibility can be defined as  how much  or  how recently  a person has been exposed to certain issues  Kim et al          Specifically  individuals try to make less cognitive effort in forming social judgments  they are more likely to rely on the information that is easily accessible  Higgins         This leads to a greater probability that more accessible information will be used when people make judgments on certain issues  Iyeanger   Kinder        Scheufele   Tewksbury         The concept of accessibility is the foundation of a memory based model  Scheufele         It assumes that individuals make judgments on the issues based on information that is easily available and retrievable from their memory  Tulving   Watkins        Hastie   Park        Iyengar         Tversky and Kahneman        also argue that the formation of individuals  judgments directly correlates with  the ease in which instances or associations could be brought to mind   p        When individuals receive and process information  they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a certain issue  Agenda setting  in this regard  can make certain issue to be easily accessed in individual s memory when forming judgment about the issue   b  Applicability  Framing  The idea of framing theory is closely related to the agenda setting theory tradition but it expands more upon the research by focusing on the substance of certain issues at hand rather than on a particular topic  This means that the framing theory s basis is that of the media focuses its attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning   is the process of selecting certain aspects of an issue to bring people s attention and to lead them a particular line of interpretation  Entman        Scheufele         Also  the media s selective uses of certain frames can affect the way the audience thinks about the issue  Oh   Kim         This may sound similar to attribute agenda setting  Both seem to examine which attributes or aspects of an issue are emphasized in the media  Kim et al          Some scholars even argue that framing should be considered as an extension of agenda setting  McCombs         However  framing is based on the applicability model  which is conceptually different from the accessibility model used in agenda setting  According to Goffman         individuals actively classify and interpret their life experiences to make sense of the world around them  These classifications and interpretations then become the individual s pre existing and long standing schema  Framing influences how audience thinks about issues  not by making certain aspects more salient than others  but by invoking interpretive cues that correspond to the individuals  pre existing schema  Scheufele         Also  framing is when these interpretive cues correspond with or activate individuals  pre existing cognitive schema  Kim et al          Applicability  in this regard  refers to finding the connection between the message in the media and the framework individuals employ to interpret the issue  Scheufele   Tewksbury         Kim and his colleagues        provide distinction between the applicability and accessibility models is important in terms of issue salience  Framing assumes that each individual will have its own interpretation of an issue  regardless of the salience of an issue  Specifically  it focuses on the  terminological or semantic differences  of how an issue is described  Agenda setting  on the other hand  assume that only salient issues in the media will become accessible in people s minds when they evaluate or make judgments on the issue  Taken together  the accessibility of issue salience makes the two models of information processing different  Scheufele          An emotion dimension edit  According to the theory of affective intelligence   emotions enhance citizen rationality   It argues that emotions  particularly negative ones  are crucial in having people pay attention to politics and help shape their political views      Based on that  Renita Coleman and H  Denis Wu            study whether the TV portrayals of candidates impacts people s political judgment during the      U S  presidential Election  They find that apart from the cognitive assessment  which is commonly studied before  emotion is another critical dimension of the second level affects in agenda setting  Three conclusions are presented   The media s emotional affective agenda corresponds with the public s emotional impressions of candidates  Negative emotions are more powerful than positive emotions  Agenda setting effects are greater on the audiences  emotions than on their cognitive assessments of character traits  Agenda setting between media and other sources edit  Recent research on agenda setting digs into the question of  who sets the media agenda        Power relations between media and other sources edit  Littlejohn and Foss            suggest that there are four types of power relations between media and other sources   High power source   high power media  both are equals in setting the agenda High power source   low power media  the source sets the agenda for the media Low power source   high power media  the media set their own agenda and may marginalize the source Low power source   low power media  both are too weak to set the public agenda Intermedia agenda setting edit  News organizations affect one another s agendas  McCombs and Bell            observe that journalists live in  an ambiguous social world  so that they will  rely on one another for confirmation and as a source of ideas   Lim            finds that the major news websites in South Korea influence the agendas of online newspapers and also influence each other to some extent  According to McCombs and Funk             intermedia agenda setting is a new path of the future agenda setting research  In addition to social media  popular daily publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post are  agenda setters  within the United States Media  These publications have a direct effect on local newspapers and television networks that are viewed on a less elite scale  Website networks favor other websites that tend to have a higher viewing and SEO  This type of relationship is known as Power Law which allows the media to have a stronger effect on agenda setting   Furthermore  the  birds of a feather  argument suggests that because news now exists in a network of connected websites  elite and other types of news media are now more motivated to behave similarly    Third level agenda setting  network agenda setting model edit  The most recent agenda setting studies explore  the extent to which the news media can transfer the salience of relationships among a set of elements to the public       That is  researchers assume that the media can not only influence the salience of certain topics in public agenda  but they can also influence how the public relate these topics to one another  Based on that  Guo  Vu and McCombs            bring up a new theoretical model called Network Agenda Setting Model  which they refer to as the third level agenda setting  This model shows that  the news media can bundle sets of objects or attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in the public s mind simultaneously   In other words  elements in people s mind are not linear as traditional approaches indicate  instead  they are interconnected with each other to make a network like structure in one s mind  and if the news media always mention two elements together  the audience will  perceive these two elements as interconnected    Application of agenda setting theory for the study of various topics edit  In USA edit  Twitter application edit  Over the last few years  the increase in social media use has had a direct effect on political campaign strategy  particularly on the Social Media platform Twitter  Its unique platform allows users to showcase their political opinion without functioning two directions  It is currently being viewed as a platform for political advancement  Before the use of Twitter  political candidates were using blogs and websites to portray their message and to gain more attention and popularity among their followers  Some of the most followed users on Twitter are past and current Presidents of the United States and other political figures  In terms of retweets  politicians and political parties have been labeled  influentials  on Twitter  Twitter is being used as a resource to gather information  reach a larger audience and engagement  stay up to date with current social and political issues  and to achieve the agenda building role  Twitter helps express public opinion which in turn allows a relationship to form between the media and the public  Some may argue that Twitter is still being used as a place for people to follow celebrity news and the culture of Hollywood more than it is being used for important issues and world news  Some may also argue that Twitter does not have the ability to set an agenda as much as conventional news outlets  A      study found a positive correlation between issue ranks in news coverage and issue ranks in Twitter feeds  suggesting that Twitter and conventional news outlets by and large reflected each other      The influence of Twitter may not always seem direct and can change during different phases   Non political application edit  McCombs and Shaw originally established agenda setting within the context of a presidential election  Many subsequent studies have looked at agenda setting in the context of an election or in otherwise political contexts  However  more recently scholars have been studying agenda setting in the context of brand community  A brand is defined as what resides in the minds of individuals about a product or service  Brand community is described as a  specialized  non geographically bound community based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand       Under these definitions more than just material products can qualify as a brand  political candidates or even celebrities could be viewed as a brand as well  The theory can also be applied to commercial advertising  business news and corporate reputation      business influence on federal policy      legal systems  trials      roles of social groups  audience control  public opinion  and public relations   Agenda setting in business communication  The central theoretical idea of agenda setting theory fits well in the world of business communication as well as political communication setting   In the case of corporate reputations  only the operational definitions of the objects and attributes on these agendas are changed to frame five key theoretical propositions about the influence of news coverage on corporate reputations among the public  This presentation of five basic propositions offers a theoretical roadmap for systematic empirical research into the influence of the mass media on corporate reputations      Agenda setting in advertising  Ghorpade demonstrated media s agenda setting can  go beyond the transfer of silence to the effect of intended behavior  and is thus relevant to advertising      Agenda setting in interpersonal communication  Although agenda setting theory is related to mass communication theory  it can be applied to interpersonal communication as well  Yang and Stone investigated people who prefer to interpersonal communication have the same agenda as others who rely on mass media  According to them  the public agenda suggested by media can flow through interpersonal communication as well      Agenda setting in crime  Agenda setting can be connected to cultivation theory  Lowry et al  conducted a longitudinal study and revealed that network television news covering crimes often made the public not only concentrate on criminal cases but also tremble with fear      Agenda setting in health communication  Ogata Jones  Denham and Springston        studied the mass and interpersonal communication on breast cancer screening practice and found that mass media is essential in  setting an agenda for proactive health behaviors   Women who were directly or indirectly exposed to news articles about breast cancer tended to conduct more frequent screenings than those hadn t read such articles      Agenda setting and stereotypes  Besova and Cooley        found that the agenda setting function of the media has a major effect on public opinion and how Americans perceive or judge a particular issue  They also found that negative media coverage  as opposed to neutral or positive  has greater agenda setting power which can contribute to the formation and perpetuation of stereotypes  For example  the media often portrays foreign countries stereotypically by only covering certain stories concerned with certain issues  Only      of the international news produced by the United States media covers Africa which likely means viewers do not receive a well rounded view of the entire continent       Study of topics outside US edit  Europe  Agenda setting theory is applicable to other countries as well  In Europe  agenda setting theory has been applied in similar pattern as in the United States          McCombs and Maxwell also investigated agenda setting theory in the context of the      regional and municipal elections in Spain      Maniou and Bantimaroudis        examined the application of agenda setting theory in the case of the Greek media during the left administration of A  Tsipras and introduced the term  hybrid salience       China  Guoliang  Shao and Bowman examined that agenda setting effect in China is not as strong as in the Western world  They provided empirical evidences in political and media structure in China      Japan  In an analysis of the policy making process concerning temporary labor migration to Japan  Kremers observed how migrant advocacy organizations influencing public opinion through agenda setting  priming and framing  had a limiting effect on the impact of other interest groups      Future research topics  presently understudied  edit    See also  Framing effect and Schema Since the Chapel Hill study  a great deal of research has been carried out to discover the agenda setting influence of the news media  The theory has not been limited to elections  and many scholars constantly explored the agenda setting effect in a variety of communication situations  This explains that agenda setting has a theoretical value which is able to synthesize social phenomena and to build new research questions  Another contribution of agenda setting is to show the power of media  Since the study of      presidential election in Erie County  Ohio  by Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues  little evidence of mass communication effects was found over the next twenty years  In       Joseph Klapper s Effects of Mass Communication also declared the limited effect of media  Agenda setting caused a paradigm shift in the study of media effects from persuading to informing by its connection of media content and its effects on the public   Empowerment of masses and decentralizing impact of Internet edit    See also  Internet influences on communities The advent of the Internet and social networks give rise to a variety of opinions concerning agenda setting effects online  Some have claimed that the power of traditional media has been weakened          Others think that the agenda setting process and its role have continued on the Internet  specifically in electronic bulletin boards      With the presence of rapid mass communication  like social media  the agenda setting theory is both supported and challenged to evolve  Some suggest that social media and traditional media in political campaigns will integrate  Social media is the next step of agenda setting because now popular Twitter handles can now choose what they want their followers to see  While some theorize that the rise of social media will bring a downfall to journalists ability to set the agenda  there is considerable scholarship to counterbalance this form of thinking      People can also chose which accounts they want to follow on any social media platform  This has changed the way in which agenda setting is going and will continue to change throughout the evolution of technology and different media platforms  One example that provides realistic criticism for this theory was the use of Twitter by reporters during the      presidential election     and the role that two way communication models now exist within the news media discourse  Traditional media such as newspapers and broadcast television are  vertical media  in which authority  power and influence come from the  top  and flow  down  to the public  Nowadays vertical media is undergoing rapid decline with the growing of  horizontal media    new media enables everyone to become a source of information and influence  which means the media is  distributed horizontally instead of top down        Agenda melding edit    See also  Cultural values  Herd behavior  Conflict resolution  and Agenda building Another change of Agenda setting Theory is known as agenda melding  which focuses  on the personal agendas of individuals vis   vis their community and group affiliations       This means that individuals join groups and blend their agendas with the agendas of the group  Then groups and communities represent a  collected agenda of issues  and  one joins a group by adopting an agenda   On the other hand  agenda setting defines groups as  collections of people based on some shared values  attitudes  or opinions  that individuals join      This is different from traditional agenda setting because according to Shaw et al  individuals join groups in order to avoid social dissonance and isolation that is also known as  need for orientation       Therefore  in the past in order to belong people would learn and adopt the agenda of the group  Now with the ease of access to media  people form their own agendas and then find groups that have similar agendas that they agree with  The advances in technology have made agenda melding easy for people to develop because there is a wide range of groups and individual agendas  The Internet makes it possible for people all around the globe to find others with similar agendas and collaborate with them  In the past agenda setting was limited to general topics and it was geographically bound because travel was limited       See also edit   Cognitive and research related concepts Availability heuristic   easily recallable example  bias Framing effect  cognitive
