       Avvisi  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search  Avviso from Antwerp dated    Dec      Avvisi  Italian   av vi zi   singular  avviso  were hand written newsletters used to convey political  military  and economic news quickly and efficiently throughout Europe  and more specifically Italy  during the early modern era               In the beginning avvisi were very similar to letters written from one dignitary to another  but diverged from such letters in the sixteenth century with more standardized practices   Avvisi can be divided into two categories   public  avvisi and  secret  avvisi  though each copy was often written by the same person     In Italian  the word avviso translates to notice  warning  advice  or announcement   Contents

and peaked  in the early modern Italian world   primarily Rome and Venice   The popularity and distribution of the avvisi was driven by each court s desire to know what the opposing and even the allied courts are up to   News networks spread all across Europe  but the avviso itself was generally created in either Rome or Venice  with the rest of Europe simply consuming  citation needed   Importance edit   Avviso from Rome dated   Dec      Avvisi influenced many aspects of the early modern world including public opinion  political battles  the nature of propaganda  careers  and historical records  Public Opinion Avvisi helped to develop public opinion by informing  organizing  and providing a voice for the public   They allowed the general public to learn of the secret dealings of the nation s leaders  form a response  and then have that response actually be heard by their fellow citizens   essentially making them new players in the game of politics  citation needed  Politics and War Though officially renounced by many leaders at the time  avvisi were then used by those very same leaders to wage their political campaigns against one another   Destruction and censorship of avvisi was selective  demonstrating that the authorities recognized the importance of spreading news but would have preferred to spread only news that was of benefit to themselves  citation needed   Competition quickly led to avvisi being used as propaganda devices both as a machine of war citation needed  and in attempts to turn the mob on their own country      Conflict as a result of avvisi being used as propaganda is certainly not out of the question  either with the public or between nations      Further the avvisi provided the public with political power rarely seen before in the form of  secret  information that could have allowed them to have influence upon the courts  citation needed  and government decisions      A minority of people  such as Paolo Sarpi  believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of avvisi and make full use of publication to combat enemy publication   An example of this includes several pamphlets written by Sarpi in defense of Venice s rights over the Adriatic  citation needed  Finances and Wealth Creation and distribution of avvisi required writers  those who can deliver the news  and those who can grant the information that makes the news and this provided many people with jobs  earning them money through standard means   In addition  invaluable secrets provided by the avvisi could be used in extortion or allowing individuals to influence prices at market   Those who used the avvisi in this way held the opinion that the information provided by avvisi could not be stopped and it was thus better to capitalize on it     History Avvisi led to a realization of the importance of the after effects of historical records  whether they be true or not   Paolo Sarpi s work is an excellent example of this  as he states that he may cause more damage dead  through his writing  than he ever had alive  citation needed   Types edit  Public avvisi Public avvisi were news letters that were available to anyone who wished to travel to a distribution center in a city   They were limited to generic  often harmless facts      Secret avvisi Secret avvisi were news letters available to a restricted audience  much akin to duplicated personal letters   Their content could be considerably more harmful than the public counterpart  as it could include opinions of top officials and the discussions from secret meetings   This form of communication often had a very specific purpose  citation needed   Distribution edit  Distribution of the avvisi began with the sources of information   Reporters  newsletter writers  menanti  reportisti  gazzettieri  had networks of contacts filtering information from chancelleries  Catholic churches  Protestant churches  foreign embassies  citation needed  and shops      Information was gathered and put together individually or at a Scrittoria  writer s workshop    The avvisi would then be distributed by regular news services and organized postal service networks   Whether newsletters were sent weekly  bi weekly  or annually depended on the type of news and the writer  citation needed      As the public avvisi were presented the news would quickly spread by word of mouth among the illiterate  no longer relying on the avvisi reporters   The range of information presented within avvisi was very broad  including countries such as France  Italy  and the Netherlands      Reporters edit  Writers of avvisi received very little recognition which  quite often  was exactly how they wanted it   Fear of censorship kept writers from signing work under their own name   for in the early modern era censorship could mean death   Mutual bonds of trust developed between certain reporters and clients once they found they could trust each other to provide reliable information without any trouble   The quality of avvisi may fall under question for numerous reasons  the recopying of documents  the translation of documents  and the insertion of opinions for example  citation needed      Censorship edit  Censorship of avvisi began with Pope Pius V s campaign  beginning in     CE   Writers caught distributing what the Catholic Church determined to be defamatory were punished severely   several examples of punishments include death  imprisonment  and torture  sometimes to death     The harsh punishments did not prevent writers from continuing in their task  though they were forced to use pseudonyms      The avvisi were blamed for causing disputes by church officials and writers   However  institutions that condemned avvisi found they could do nothing to quell the hand written newsletters and began to use them to their own benefit  even with bans still in place      Religious leaders were not alone in banning newsletters   more secular leaders also laid down limitations and prohibitions  including Venice s Council of Ten who held bans until at least           A popular reporter  Paolo Sarpi  was a minority in his time for holding the belief that the spread of information could not be stopped so censorship was a waste of resources   Sarpi believed that the only way to combat the enemy s newsletters is for the government to have their own avviso  citation needed   Printed vs  Written edit  It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that printed avvisi became more common  and even then Venice and Rome abstained from print   Due to restrictions from censorship on printed works  a sense of urgency  and a desire for personalization hand written avvisi would not be easily replaced by the printing press  citation needed  Printed works were produced much more slowly and as a result the public would lose interest in the topic before it came to print      Further  printed avvisi were less robust in an effort to avoid censors and cut editing time       See also edit  List of the earliest newspapers Gazetteer Journalism Journalist Journal  disambiguation  Newspaper Printing press
