is the fourth most populous state  To distinguish it from New York City  which is the largest city in the state  it is sometimes referred to as New York State  Two thirds of the state s population lives in the New York metropolitan area  including nearly forty percent on Long Island      The state and city were named for the   th century Duke of York  the future King James II of England  With an estimated population of      million in          New York City is the most populous city in the United States and the premier gateway for immigration to the United States              The New York metropolitan area is one of the most populous in the world           A global city      NYC is home to the United Nations Headquarters      and has been described as the cultural          financial          and media capital of the world          as well as the world s most economically powerful city              The next four most populous cities in the state are Buffalo  Rochester  Yonkers  and Syracuse  while the state capital is Albany  The   th largest U S  state in land area  New York has a diverse geography  The state is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south and Connecticut  Massachusetts  and Vermont to the east  The state has a maritime border with Rhode Island  east of Long Island  as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the northwest  The southern part of the state is in the Atlantic coastal plain and includes Long Island and several smaller associated islands  as well as New York City and the lower Hudson River Valley  The large Upstate New York region comprises several ranges of the wider Appalachian Mountains  and the Adirondack Mountains in the northeastern lobe of the state  The north south Hudson River Valley and the east west Mohawk River Valley bisect these more mountainous regions  Western New York is considered part of the Great Lakes region and borders on Lake Ontario  Lake Erie  and Niagara Falls  The central part of the state is dominated by the Finger Lakes  a popular vacation and tourist destination  New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York  French colonists and Jesuit missionaries arrived southward from Montreal for trade and proselytizing  In       the region was visited by Henry Hudson sailing for the Dutch East India Company  The Dutch built Fort Nassau in      at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers  where the present day capital of Albany later developed  The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley  establishing the multicultural colony of New Netherland  a center of trade and immigration  England seized the colony from the Dutch in       During the American Revolutionary War              a group of colonists of the Province of New York attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence  In the   th century  New York s development of the interior  beginning with the Erie Canal  gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the east coast and built its political and cultural ascendancy       Many landmarks in New York are well known  including four of the world s ten most visited tourist attractions in       Times Square  Central Park  Niagara Falls  and Grand Central Terminal      New York is home to the Statue of Liberty      In the   st century  New York has emerged as a global node of

article  History of New York  state  Native American history edit   New York was dominated by Iroquoian  purple  and Algonquian  pink  tribes  The tribes in what is now New York were predominantly Haudenosaunee and Algonquian  Long Island was divided roughly in half between the Wampanoag and Lenape  The Lenape also controlled most of the region surrounding New York Harbor  North of the Lenape was a third Algonquian nation  the Mohicans  Starting north of them  from east to west  were three Iroquoian nations  the Mohawk  the original Iroquois and the Petun  South of them  divided roughly along Appalachia  were the Susquehannock and the Erie                          Many of the Wampanoag and Mohican peoples were caught up in King Philip s War  a joint effort of many New England tribes to push Europeans off their land  After the death of their leader  Chief Philip Metacomet  most of those peoples fled inland  splitting into the Abenaki and the Schaghticoke  Many of the Mohicans remained in the region until the     s      however  a small group known as the Ouabano migrated southwest into West Virginia at an earlier time  They may have merged with the Shawnee          The Mohawk and Susquehannock were the most militaristic  Trying to corner trade with the Europeans  they targeted other tribes  The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity  They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans  while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the     s  The most devastating event of the century  however  was the Beaver Wars  From approximately            Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes  as well as each other  The aim was to control more land for animal trapping  a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first  This completely changed the ethnography of the region  and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land  Still  afterward  the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the Mascouten  Erie  Chonnonton  Tutelo  Saponi  and Tuscarora nations  In the     s  they would also merge with the Mohawk during the French Indian War and take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in war      Most of these other groups blended in until they ceased to exist  Then  after the Revolution  a large group of them split off and returned to Ohio  becoming known as the Mingo Seneca  The current six tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy are the Seneca  Cayuga  Onondaga  Oneida  Tuscarora and Mohawk  The Iroquois fought for both sides during the Revolutionary War  afterwards many pro British Iroquois migrated to Canada  Today  the Iroquois still live in several reservations in upstate New York                  Meanwhile  the Lenape formed a close relationship with William Penn  However  upon Penn s death  his sons managed to take over much of their lands and banish them to Ohio      When the U S  drafted the Indian Removal Act  the Lenape were further moved to Missouri  whereas their cousins  the Mohicans  were sent to Wisconsin  Also  in       the United States relocated the Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario  though they did not stay long  Mostly  they chose to migrate into Canada and merge with the Iroquois  although some moved west and merged with the Lenape         th century edit  In       Giovanni da Verrazzano  an Italian explorer in the service of the French crown  explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland  including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay  On April           Verrazzano entered New York Bay  by way of the strait now called the Narrows into the northern bay which he named Santa Margherita  in honor of the King of France s sister  Verrazzano described it as  a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass  and he adds   that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake  This vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats   He landed on the tip of Manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of Long Island  Verrazzano s stay was interrupted by a storm which pushed him north towards Martha s Vineyard      In       French traders from New France built a chateau on Castle Island  within present day Albany  it was abandoned the following year due to flooding  In       the Dutch  under the command of Hendrick Corstiaensen  rebuilt the French chateau  which they called Fort Nassau  Fort Nassau was the first Dutch settlement in North America  and was located along the Hudson River  also within present day Albany  The small fort served as a trading post and warehouse  Located on the Hudson River flood plain  the rudimentary  fort  was washed away by flooding in           and abandoned for good after Fort Orange  New Netherland  was built nearby in              th century edit  Main articles  New Netherland  Province of New York  and Dominion of New England  New Amsterdam  present day Lower Manhattan       Henry Hudson s      voyage marked the beginning of European involvement with the area  Sailing for the Dutch East India Company and looking for a passage to Asia  he entered the Upper New York Bay on September    of that year      Word of his findings encouraged Dutch merchants to explore the coast in search for profitable fur trading with local Native American tribes  During the   th century  Dutch trading posts established for the trade of pelts from the Lenape  Iroquois  and other tribes were founded in the colony of New Netherland  The first of these trading posts were Fort Nassau        near present day Albany   Fort Orange        on the Hudson River just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau   developing into settlement Beverwijck         and into what became Albany  Fort Amsterdam        to develop into the town New Amsterdam which is present day New York City   and Esopus         now Kingston   The success of the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck         which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid   th century  was also a key factor in the early success of the colony  The English captured the colony during the Second Anglo Dutch War and governed it as the Province of New York  The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in      during the Third Anglo Dutch War             and renamed New Orange  It was returned to the English under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster a year later         th century  the American Revolution  and statehood edit   New York and neighboring provinces  by Claude Joseph Sauthier       The Sons of Liberty were organized in New York City during the     s  largely in response to the oppressive Stamp Act passed by the British Parliament in       The Stamp Act Congress met in the city on October    of that year  composed of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies who set the stage for the Continental Congress to follow  The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the Declaration of Rights and Grievances  which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence  This included the right to representative government  At the same time  given strong commercial  personal and sentimental links to Britain  many New York residents were Loyalists  The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the Siege of Boston in       New York was the only colony not to vote for independence  as the delegates were not authorized to do so  New York then endorsed the Declaration of Independence on July              The New York State Constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at White Plains on July           and after repeated adjournments and changes of location  finished its work at Kingston on Sunday evening  April           when the new constitution drafted by John Jay was adopted with but one dissenting vote  It was not submitted to the people for ratification  On July           George Clinton was inaugurated as the first Governor of New York at Kingston  About a third of the battles of the American Revolutionary War took place in New York  the first major one  and largest of the entire war  was the Battle of Long Island  a k a  Battle of Brooklyn  in August       After their victory  the British occupied New York City  making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict  and consequently the focus of General George Washington s intelligence network  On the notorious British prison ships of Wallabout Bay  more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined  Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds  The first of two major British armies were captured by the Continental Army at the Battle of Saratoga in       a success that influenced France to ally with the revolutionaries The state constitution was enacted in       New York became the   th state to ratify the United States Constitution  on July             British general John Burgoyne surrenders at Saratoga in      In an attempt to retain their sovereignty and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America  four of the Iroquois Nations fought on the side of the British  only the Oneida and their dependents  the Tuscarora  allied themselves with the Americans      In retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by Joseph Brant and Loyalist Mohawk forces  the Sullivan Expedition of      destroyed nearly    Iroquois villages  adjacent croplands and winter stores  forcing many refugees to British held Niagara      As allies of the British  the Iroquois were forced out of New York  although they had not been part of treaty negotiations  They resettled in Canada after the war and were given land grants by the Crown  In the treaty settlement  the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States  Because New York made treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval  some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late   th century by the federally recognized tribes  New York put up more than   million acres         km   of former Iroquois territory for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War  leading to rapid development in upstate New York      As per the Treaty of Paris  the last vestige of British authority in the former Thirteen Colonies their troops in New York City departed in       which was long afterward celebrated as Evacuation Day             map of New York from Low s Encyclopaedia New York City was the national capital under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union  the first national government  That organization was found to be insufficient  and prominent New Yorker Alexander Hamilton advocated a new government that would include an executive  national courts  and the power to tax  Hamilton led the Annapolis Convention        that called for the Philadelphia Convention  which drafted the United States Constitution  in which he also took part  The new government was to be a strong federal national government to replace the relatively weaker confederation of individual states  Following heated debate  which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation The Federalist Papers as a series of installments in New York City newspapers  New York was the   th state to ratify the United States Constitution  on July               New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until           and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington      the drafting of the United States Bill of Rights  and the first session of the United States Supreme Court  Hamilton s revival of the heavily indebted United States economy after the war and the creation of a national bank significantly contributed to New York City becoming the financial center of the new nation  citation needed  Both the Dutch and the British imported African slaves as laborers to the city and colony  New York had the second highest population of slaves after Charleston  South Carolina  Slavery was extensive in New York City and some agricultural areas  The state passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery soon after the Revolutionary War  but the last slave in New York was not freed until              th century edit  Further information  New York in the American Civil War  The Erie Canal at Lockport  New York  in      Transportation in western New York was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farm lands to long distance traffic  Governor DeWitt Clinton promoted the Erie Canal  which connected New York City to the Great Lakes by the Hudson River  the new canal  and the rivers and lakes  Work commenced in       and the Erie Canal opened in       Packet boats pulled by horses on tow paths traveled slowly over the canal carrying passengers and freight      Farm products came in from the Midwest  and finished manufactured goods moved west  It was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement  It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as Buffalo and Rochester to grow and prosper  It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes  with the port of New York City  Improving transportation  it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York  After       railroads largely replaced the canal      New York City was a major ocean port and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the South and exporting manufacturing goods  Nearly half of the state s exports were related to cotton  Southern cotton factors  planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels      At the same time  activism for abolitionism was strong upstate  where some communities provided stops on the Underground Railroad  Upstate  and New York City  gave strong support for the American Civil War  in terms of finances  volunteer soldiers  and supplies  The state provided more than         soldiers to the Union armies  Over        New Yorkers died in service  roughly one of every seven who served  However  Irish draft riots in      were a significant embarrassment           Immigration edit  Further information  Ellis Island Play media Scenes at the Immigration Depot and a nearby dock on Ellis Island Since the early   th century  New York City has been the largest port of entry for legal immigration into the United States  In the United States  the federal government did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until       Prior to this time  the matter was delegated to the individual states  then via contract between the states and the federal government  Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and East Rivers  in the eventual Lower Manhattan  On May          the New York State Legislature created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration      The first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in      at Castle Garden  a converted War of      era fort located within what is now Battery Park  at the tip of Lower Manhattan  The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from quarantine  Castle Garden served as New York s immigrant depot until it closed on April           when the federal government assumed control over immigration  During that period  more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors  two of every three U S  immigrants       When the federal government assumed control  it established the Bureau of Immigration  which chose the three acre Ellis Island in Upper New York Harbor for an entry depot  Already federally controlled  the island had served as an ammunition depot  It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of Jersey City  New Jersey  via a short ferry ride  While the island was being developed and expanded via land reclamation  the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery      Ellis Island opened on January          and operated as a central immigration center until the National Origins Act was passed in       reducing immigration  After that date  the only immigrants to pass through were displaced persons or war refugees  The island ceased all immigration processing on November           when the last person detained on the island  Norwegian seaman Arne Peterssen  was released  He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the       a m  Manhattan bound ferry to return to his ship  More than twelve million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between      and       More than a hundred million Americans across the United States can trace their ancestry to these immigrants  Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey  as both claimed it  The issue was settled in      by the U S  Supreme Court which ruled that the original     acre      ha  island was New York State territory and that the balance of the      acres     ha  added after      by landfill was in New Jersey      The island was added to the National Park Service system in May      by President Lyndon B  Johnson and is still owned by the federal government as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument  Ellis Island was opened to the public as a museum of immigration in            September          edit  Main article  September    attacks  Flight     hitting the South Tower on September          On September           two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan  and the towers collapsed    World Trade Center also collapsed due to damage from fires  The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and demolished soon thereafter  The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of       victims  including     aboard the two planes  Since September     most of Lower Manhattan has been restored  In the years since  over       rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life threatening illnesses  and some have died          A memorial at the site  the National September    Memorial   Museum  was opened to the public on September           A permanent museum later opened at the site on March           Upon its completion in       the new One World Trade Center became the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere  at       feet      m   meant to symbolize the year America gained its independence            From      to         World Trade Center    World Trade Center    World Trade Center  the World Trade Center Transportation Hub  Liberty Park  and Fiterman Hall were completed  St  Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and Ronald O  Perelman Performing Arts Center are under construction at the World Trade Center site   Hurricane Sandy       edit  Main article  Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York  Flooding on Avenue C in Lower Manhattan caused by Hurricane Sandy On October    and           Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction of the state s shorelines  ravaging portions of New York City  Long Island  and southern Westchester with record high storm surge  with severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers  and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems  The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event  Such risk is considered highly probable due to global warming and rising sea levels           COVID    pandemic       edit  Main article  COVID    pandemic in New York  state  On March          New York had its first confirmed case of COVID         Since March     New York had the highest number of confirmed cases of any state in the United States  Nearly    percent of known national cases were in the state      with one third of total known U S  cases being in New York City      From May        Western New York and the Capital Region entered Phase   of reopening          On May     the Hudson Valley began Phase        and New York City partially reopened on June        During the pandemic  a federal judge ruled Cuomo and De Blasio exceeded authority by limiting religious gatherings to     when others operated at     capacity              New York s government released a new seal  coat of arms  and flag in April during the pandemic  adding  E pluribus unum  below the state s motto          A bill utilizing newly designed flag  arms and seal went into effect in September       Geography edit  Main article  Geography of New York  state   New York is bordered by five U S  states  two Great Lakes  and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec  The state of New York covers        square miles          km   and ranks as the   th largest state by size     The highest elevation in New York is Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks  at       feet        meters  above sea level  while the state s lowest point is at sea level  on the Atlantic Ocean      In contrast with New York City s urban landscape  the vast majority of the state s geographic area is dominated by meadows  forests  rivers  farms  mountains  and lakes  Most of the southern part of the state rests on the Allegheny Plateau  which extends from the southeastern United States to the Catskill Mountains  the section in New York State is known as the Southern Tier  The rugged Adirondack Mountains  with vast tracts of wilderness  lie west of the Lake Champlain Valley  The Great Appalachian Valley dominates eastern New York and contains the Lake Champlain Valley as its northern half and the Hudson Valley as its southern half within the state  The Tug Hill region arises as a cuesta east of Lake Ontario      Upstate and downstate are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State  The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention      Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the Southern Tier  which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania      and the North Country  which can mean anything from the strip along the Canada U S  border to everything north of the Mohawk River      New York contains a part of the Marcellus shale  which extends into Ohio and Pennsylvania       Water edit  Borders edit   Enveloped by the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound  New York City and Long Island alone are home to about eleven million residents conjointly  Of New York State s total area        consists of water      Much of New York s boundaries are in water  as is true for New York City  four of its five boroughs are situated on three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River  Manhattan Island  Staten Island  and Long Island  which contains Brooklyn and Queens at its western end  The state s borders include a water boundary in  clockwise from the west  two Great Lakes  Lake Erie and Lake Ontario  which are connected by the Niagara River   the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada  with New York and Ontario sharing the Thousand Islands archipelago within the Saint Lawrence River  while most of its border with Quebec is on land  it shares Lake Champlain with the New England state of Vermont  the New England state of Massachusetts has mostly a land border  New York extends into Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean  sharing a water border with Rhode Island  while Connecticut has land and sea borders  Except for areas near the New York Harbor and the Upper Delaware River  New York has a mostly land border with two Mid Atlantic states  New Jersey and Pennsylvania  New York is the only state that includes within its borders parts of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean   Drainage edit  The Hudson River begins near Lake Tear of the Clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state  without draining Lakes George or Champlain  Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain  whose northern end extends into Canada  where it drains into the Richelieu River and then ultimately the Saint Lawrence River  The western section of the state is drained by the Allegheny River and rivers of the Susquehanna and Delaware River systems  Niagara Falls is shared between New York and Ontario as it flows on the Niagara River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario  The Delaware River Basin Compact  signed in      by New York  New Jersey  Pennsylvania  Delaware  and the federal government  regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system        Climate edit  Main article  Climate of New York  Lake effect snow is a major contributor to heavy snowfall totals in western New York  including the Tug Hill region  In general  New York has a humid continental climate  though under the K ppen climate classification  New York City has a humid subtropical climate       Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses  a warm  humid one from the southwest and a cold  dry one from the northwest  Downstate New York  comprising New York City  Long Island  and lower portions of the Hudson Valley  has rather hot summers with some periods of high humidity and cold  damp winters which are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York due to the downstate region s lower elevation  proximity to the Atlantic Ocean  and
