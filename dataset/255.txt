Political map of Europe with countries where a Slavic language is a national language marked in shades of green  Wood green represents East Slavic languages  pale green represents West Slavic languages  and sea green represents South Slavic languages  The Slavic languages  also known as the Slavonic languages  are Indo European languages spoken primarily by the Slavic peoples or their descendants  They are thought to descend from a proto language called Proto Slavic  spoken during the Early Middle Ages  which in turn is thought to have descended from the earlier Proto Balto Slavic language  linking the Slavic languages to the Baltic languages in a Balto Slavic group within the Indo European family  The Slavic languages are conventionally  that is  also on the basis of extralinguistic features  divided into three subgroups  East  West  and South  which together constitute more than    languages  Of these     have at least one million speakers and official status as the national languages of the countries in which they are predominantly spoken  Russian  Belarusian and Ukrainian  of the East group   Polish  Czech and Slovak  of the West group  and Bulgarian and Macedonian  eastern dialects of the South group   and Serbo Croatian and Slovene  western dialects of the South group   In addition  Aleksandr Dulichenko recognizes a number of Slavic microlanguages  both isolated ethnolects and peripheral dialects of more well established Slavic languages           The current geographic distribution of natively spoken Slavic languages includes Southern Europe  Central Europe  the Balkans  Eastern Europe  and all of the territory of Russia  which includes northern and north central Asia  though many minority languages of Russia are also still spoken   Furthermore  the diasporas of many Slavic peoples have established isolated minorities of speakers of their languages all over the world  The number of speakers of all Slavic languages together was estimated to be     million at the turn of the twenty first century     it is the largest ethno linguistic group in Europe         Contents    Branches   History      Common roots and ancestry

Languages Since the interwar period scholars have conventionally divided Slavic languages  on the basis of geographical and genealogical principle  and with the use of the extralinguistic feature of script  into three main branches  that is  East  West and South   From the vantage of linguistic features alone  there are only two branches of the Slavic languages  namely North and South     These three conventional branches feature some of the following subbranches   East Slavic  Belarusian Russian Ukrainian Rusyn West Slavic  Czech Slovak Czech Slovak Lechitic Polish  Silesian Pomeranian Kashubian Sorbian Upper Sorbian Lower Sorbian South Slavic  Eastern Bulgarian Macedonian Church Slavonic Western Serbo Croatian Serbian Croatian Bosnian Montenegrin Burgenland Croatian Slovene Some linguists speculate that a North Slavic branch has existed as well  The Old Novgorod dialect may have reflected some idiosyncrasies of this group  Mutual intelligibility also plays a role in determining the West  East  and South branches  Speakers of languages within the same branch will in most cases be able to understand each other at least partially  but they are generally unable to across branches  which would be comparable to a native English speaker trying to understand any other Germanic language besides Scots   The most obvious differences between the East  West and South Slavic branches are in the orthography of the standard languages  West Slavic languages  and Western South Slavic languages   Croatian and Slovene  are written in the Latin script  and have had more Western European influence due to their proximity and speakers being historically Roman Catholic  whereas the East Slavic and Eastern South Slavic languages are written in Cyrillic and  with Eastern Orthodox or Uniate faith  have had more Greek influence     East Slavic languages such as Russian have  however  during and after Peter the Great s Europeanization campaign  absorbed many words of Latin  French  German  and Italian origin  The tripartite division of the Slavic languages does not take into account the spoken dialects of each language  Of these  certain so called transitional dialects and hybrid dialects often bridge the gaps between different languages  showing similarities that do not stand out when comparing Slavic literary  i e  standard  languages  For example  Slovak  West Slavic  and Ukrainian  East Slavic  are bridged by the Rusyn language dialect of Eastern Slovakia and Western Ukraine      Similarly  the Croatian Kajkavian dialect is more similar to Slovene than to the standard Croatian language  Although the Slavic languages diverged from a common proto language later than any other group of the Indo European language family  enough differences exist between the various Slavic dialects and languages to make communication between speakers of different Slavic languages difficult  Within the individual Slavic languages  dialects may vary to a lesser degree  as those of Russian  or to a much greater degree  like those of Slovene   History Part of a series onIndo European topics Languages List of Indo European languages  Historical Albanian Persian

languages descend from Proto Slavic  their immediate parent language  ultimately deriving from Proto Indo European  the ancestor language of all Indo European languages  via a Proto Balto Slavic stage  During the Proto Balto Slavic period a number of exclusive isoglosses in phonology  morphology  lexis  and syntax developed  which makes Slavic and Baltic the closest related of all the Indo European branches  The secession of the Balto Slavic dialect ancestral to Proto Slavic is estimated on archaeological and glottochronological criteria to have occurred sometime in the period           BCE      A minority of Baltists maintain the view that the Slavic group of languages differs so radically from the neighboring Baltic group  Lithuanian  Latvian  and the now extinct Old Prussian   that they could not have shared a parent language after the breakup of the Proto Indo European continuum about five millennia ago  Substantial advances in Balto Slavic accentology that occurred in the last three decades  however  make this view very hard to maintain nowadays  especially when one considers that there was most likely no  Proto Baltic  language and that West Baltic and East Baltic differ from each other as much as each of them does from Proto Slavic        Ba ka tablet    th century  Krk  Croatia  Evolution This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve

Slavonic on Orthodox Slavs was often at the expense of the vernacular  Says WB Lockwood  a prominent Indo European linguist   It  O C S  remained in use to modern times but was more and more influenced by the living  evolving languages  so that one distinguishes Bulgarian  Serbian  and Russian varieties  The use of such media hampered the development of the local languages for literary purposes  and when they do appear the first attempts are usually in an artificially mixed style         Lockwood also notes that these languages have  enriched  themselves by drawing on Church Slavonic for the vocabulary of abstract concepts  The situation in the Catholic countries  where Latin was more important  was different  The Polish Renaissance poet Jan Kochanowski and the Croatian Baroque writers of the   th century all wrote in their respective vernaculars  though Polish itself had drawn amply on Latin in the same way Russian would eventually draw on Church Slavonic       th century Novgorodian children were literate enough to send each other letters written on birch bark  Although Church Slavonic hampered vernacular literatures  it fostered Slavonic literary activity and abetted linguistic independence from external influences  Only the Croatian vernacular literary tradition nearly matches Church Slavonic in age  It began with the Vinodol Codex and continued through the Renaissance until the codifications of Croatian in       though much of the literature between      and      was written in much the same mixture of the vernacular and Church Slavonic as prevailed in Russia and elsewhere  The most important early monument of Croatian literacy is the Ba ka tablet from the late   th century  It is a large stone tablet found in the small Church of St  Lucy  Jurandvor on the Croatian island of Krk  containing text written mostly in  akavian dialect in angular Croatian Glagolitic script  The independence of Dubrovnik facilitated the continuity of the tradition      th   th century Codex Zographensis  canonical monument of Old Church Slavonic More recent foreign influences follow the same general pattern in Slavic languages as elsewhere and are governed by the political relationships of the Slavs  In the   th century  bourgeois Russian  delovoi jazyk  absorbed German words through direct contacts between Russians and communities of German settlers in Russia  In the era of Peter the Great  close contacts with France invited countless loan words and calques from French  many of which not only survived but also replaced older Slavonic loans  In the   th century  Russian influenced most literary Slavic languages by one means or another   Differentiation The Proto Slavic language existed until around AD      By the  th century  it had broken apart into large dialectal zones  There are no reliable hypotheses about the nature of the subsequent breakups of West and South Slavic  East Slavic is generally thought to converge to one Old East Slavic language  which existed until at least the   th century  Linguistic differentiation was accelerated by the dispersion of the Slavic peoples over a large territory  which in Central Europe exceeded the current extent of Slavic speaking majorities  Written documents of the  th    th  and   th centuries already display some local linguistic features  For example  the Freising manuscripts show a language that contains some phonetic and lexical elements peculiar to Slovene dialects  e g  rhotacism  the word krilatec   The Freising manuscripts are the first Latin script continuous text in a Slavic language  The migration of Slavic speakers into the Balkans in the declining centuries of the Byzantine Empire expanded the area of Slavic speech  but the pre existing writing  notably Greek  survived in this area  The arrival of the Hungarians in Pannonia in the  th century interposed non Slavic speakers between South and West Slavs  Frankish conquests completed the geographical separation between these two groups  also severing the connection between Slavs in Moravia and Lower Austria  Moravians  and those in present day Styria  Carinthia  East Tyrol in Austria  and in the provinces of modern Slovenia  where the ancestors of the Slovenes settled during first colonisation    Map and tree of Slavic languages  according to Kassian and A  Dybo In September       Alexei Kassian and Anna Dybo published      as a part of interdisciplinary study of Slavic ethnogenesis  a lexicostatistical classification of Slavic languages  It was built using qualitative     word Swadesh lists that were compiled according to the standards of the Global Lexicostatistical Database project     and processed using modern phylogenetic algorithms  The resulting dated tree complies with the traditional expert views on the Slavic group structure  Kassian Dybo s tree suggests that Proto Slavic first diverged into three branches  Eastern  Western and Southern  The Proto Slavic break up is dated to around     A D   which correlates with the archaeological assessment of Slavic population in the early  st millennium A D  being spread on a large territory     and already not being monolithic      Then  in the  th and  th centuries A D   these three Slavic branches almost simultaneously divided into sub branches  which corresponds to the fast spread of the Slavs through Eastern Europe and the Balkans during the second half of the  st millennium A D   the so called Slavicization of Europe                   The Slovenian language was excluded from the analysis  as both Ljubljana koine and Literary Slovenian show mixed lexical features of Southern and Western Slavic languages  which could possibly indicate the Western Slavic origin of Slovenian  which for a long time was being influenced on the part of the neighboring Serbo Croatian dialects   original research   and the quality Swadesh lists were not yet collected for Slovenian dialects  Because of scarcity or unreliability of data  the study also did not cover the so called Old Novgordian dialect  the Polabian language and some other Slavic lects  The above Kassian Dybo s research did not take into account the findings by Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak who stated that in the   th century Novgorod language differed from Kiev language as well as from all other Slavic languages much more than in later centuries  meaning that there was no common Old East Slavic language of Kievan Rus  from which Ukrainian  Russian and Belorussian languages diverged  but that the Russian language developed as the convergence of Novgorod language and other Russian dialects  whereas Ukrainian and Belorusian were continuation of the development of respective Kiev and Polotsk dialects of Kievan Rus       Also Russian linguist Sergey Nikolaev  analysing historical development of Slavic dialects  accent system  concluded that a number of other tribes in Kievan Rus came from different Slavic branches and spoke distant Slavic dialects      Zaliznyak and Nikolaev s points mean that there was a convergence stage before the divergence or simultaneously  which was not taken into consideration by Kassian Dybo s research  Ukrainian linguists  Stepan Smal Stotsky  Ivan Ohienko  George Shevelov  Yevhen Tymchenko  Vsevolod Hantsov  Olena Kurylo  deny the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past      According to them  the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto Slavic language without any intermediate stages

Development of phonemic tone and vowel length  independent of vowel quality   Complex developments  see History of accentual developments in Slavic languages   Features The Slavic languages are a relatively homogeneous family  compared with other families of Indo European languages  e g  Germanic  Romance  and Indo Iranian    As late as the   th century AD  the entire Slavic speaking area still functioned as a single  dialectally differentiated language  termed Common Slavic  Compared with most other Indo European languages  the Slavic languages are quite conservative  particularly in terms of morphology  the means of inflecting nouns and verbs to indicate grammatical differences   Most Slavic languages have a rich  fusional morphology that conserves much of the inflectional morphology of Proto Indo European       Consonants The following table shows the inventory of consonants of Late Common Slavic        Consonants of Late Proto Slavic     Labial  Coronal  Palatal

The sound  s   did not occur in West Slavic  where it had developed to      This inventory of sounds is quite similar to what is found in most modern Slavic languages  The extensive series of palatal consonants  along with the affricates  ts and  dz  developed through a series of palatalizations that happened during the Proto Slavic period  from earlier sequences either of velar consonants followed by front vowels  e g   ke   ki   ge   gi   xe  and  xi   or of various consonants followed by  j  e g   tj   dj   sj   zj   rj   lj   kj  and  gj  where  j is the palatal approximant   j   the sound of the English letter  y  in  yes  or  you    The biggest change in this inventory results from a further general palatalization occurring near the end of the Common Slavic period  where all consonants became palatalized before front vowels  This produced a large number of new palatalized  or  soft   sounds  which formed pairs with the corresponding non palatalized  or  hard   consonants     and absorbed the existing palatalized sounds  l   r   n   s   These sounds were best preserved in Russian but were lost to varying degrees in other languages  particularly Czech and Slovak   The

 Approximant    l l     j    This general process of palatalization did not occur in Serbo Croatian and Slovenian  As a result  the modern consonant inventory of these languages is nearly identical to the Late Common Slavic inventory  Late Common Slavic tolerated relatively few consonant clusters  However  as a result of the loss of certain formerly present vowels  the weak yers   the modern Slavic languages allow quite complex clusters  as in the Russian word          vzbl esk    flash    Also present in many Slavic languages are clusters rarely found cross linguistically  as in Russian        rtut     mercury   or Polish mchu  mxu    moss   gen  sg    The word for  mercury  with the initial rt  cluster  for example  is also found in the other East and West Slavic languages  although Slovak

noticeable characteristic of the languages in which it is present   Russian       m     help info  and Polish mysz  m     mouse  Common Slavic also had two nasal vowels         and         However  these are preserved only in modern Polish  along with a few lesser known dialects and microlanguages  see Yus for more details    Polish w    v     and w  e  v       snake  snakes  Other phonemic vowels are found in certain languages  e g  the schwa     in Bulgarian and Slovenian  distinct high mid and low mid vowels in Slovenian  and the lax front vowel     in Ukrainian    Length  accent  and tone An area of great difference among Slavic languages is that of prosody  i e  syllabic distinctions such as vowel length  accent  and tone   Common Slavic had a complex system of prosody  inherited with little change from Proto Indo European  This consisted of phonemic vowel length and a free  mobile pitch accent   All vowels could occur either short or long  and this was phonemic  it could not automatically be predicted from other properties of the word   There was  at most  a single accented syllable per word  distinguished by higher pitch  as in modern Japanese  rather than greater dynamic stress  as in English   Vowels in accented syllables could be pronounced with either a rising or falling tone  i e  there was pitch accent   and this was phonemic  The accent was free in that it could occur on any syllable and was phonemic  The accent was mobile in that its position could potentially vary among closely related words within a single paradigm  e g  the accent might land on a different syllable between the nominative and genitive singular of a given word   Even within a given inflectional class  e g  masculine i stem nouns   there were multiple accent patterns in which a given word could be inflected  For example  most nouns in a particular inflectional class could follow one of three possible patterns  Either there was a consistent accent on the root  pattern A   predominant accent on the ending  pattern B   or accent that moved between the root and ending  pattern C   In patterns B and C  the accent in different parts of the paradigm shifted not only in location but also type  rising vs  falling   Each inflectional class had its own version of patterns B and C  which might differ significantly from one inflectional class to another  The modern languages vary greatly in the extent to which they preserve this system  On one extreme  Serbo Croatian preserves the system nearly unchanged  even more so in the conservative Chakavian dialect   on the other  Macedonian has basically lost the system in its entirety  Between them are found numerous variations   Slovenian preserves most of the system but has shortened all unaccented syllables and lengthened non final accented syllables so that vowel length and accent position largely co occur  Russian and Bulgarian have eliminated distinctive vowel length and tone and converted the accent into a stress accent  as in English  but preserved its position  As a result  the complexity of the mobile accent and the multiple accent patterns still exists  particularly in Russian because it has preserved the Common Slavic noun inflections  while Bulgarian has lost them   Czech and Slovak have preserved phonemic vowel length and converted the distinctive tone of accented syllables into length distinctions  The phonemic accent is otherwise lost  but the former accent patterns are echoed to some extent in corresponding patterns of vowel length shortness in the root  Paradigms with mobile vowel length shortness do exist but only in a limited fashion  usually only with the zero ending forms  nom  sg   acc  sg   and or gen  pl   depending on inflectional class  having a different length from the other forms   Czech has a couple of other  mobile  patterns  but they are rare and can usually be substituted with one of the  normal  mobile patterns or a non mobile pattern   Old Polish had a system very much like Czech  Modern Polish has lost vowel length  but some former short long pairs have become distinguished by quality  e g   o o      o u    with the result that some words have vowel quality changes that exactly mirror the mobile length patterns in Czech and Slovak  Grammar This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it   February       Similarly  Slavic languages have extensive morphophonemic alternations in their derivational and inflectional morphology      including between velar and postalveolar consonants  front and back vowels  and a vowel and no vowel       Selected cognates Main article  Slavic vocabulary This section should specify the language of its non English content  using   lang    with an appropriate ISO     code  See why

languages of the former Soviet Union and of some neighbouring countries  for example  Mongolian  are significantly influenced by Russian  especially in vocabulary  The Romanian  Albanian  and Hungarian languages show the influence of the neighboring Slavic nations  especially in vocabulary pertaining to urban life  agriculture  and crafts and trade the major cultural innovations at times of limited long range cultural contact  In each one of these languages  Slavic lexical borrowings represent at least     of the total vocabulary  However  Romanian has much lower influence from Slavic than Albanian or Hungarian  citation needed  This is potentially because Slavic tribes crossed and partially settled the territories inhabited by ancient Illyrians and Vlachs on their way to the Balkans   Germanic languages The Slavic contributions to Germanic languages remains a moot question  though Max Vasmer  a specialist in Slavic etymology  has claimed that there were no Slavic loans into Proto Germanic  Nevertheless  many linguists  including Andrzej Poppe  consider the Slavic contribution to the Germanic languages to be enormous  A large number of Slavic loanwords are found in the Gothic language  hlaifs  bread  from Proto Slavonic hleb   katils  cauldron  from Proto Slavonic kotel   biu s  table  from Proto Slavonic bliudo   kaupjan  buy  from Proto Slavonic kupit   skeinan  shine  from Proto Slavonic sianye   boka  letter  from Proto Slavonic bukva   etc      On the other hand  scientists Rasmus Rask and August Schleicher argued that such a number of Slavicisms in the German language is explained by the fact that the Slavic and Germanic languages have a common origin          However  there are isolated Slavic loans  mostly recent  into other Germanic languages  For example  the word for  border   in modern German Grenze  Dutch grens  was borrowed from the Common Slavic granica  There are  however  many cities and villages of Slavic origin in Eastern Germany  the largest of which are Berlin  Leipzig and Dresden  English derives quark  a kind of cheese and subatomic particle  from the German Quark  which in turn is derived from the Slavic tvarog  which means  curd   Many German surnames  particularly in Eastern Germany and Austria  are Slavic in origin  Swedish also has torg  market place  from Old Russian t rg  or Polish targ      tolk  interpreter  from Old Slavic tl k       and pr m  barge  from West Slavonic pram        Finnic languages Finnic and Slavic languages have many words in common  According to Petri Kallio  this suggests borrowing Slavic words into Finnish languages  as early as Proto Finnic      Many loanwords have acquired a Finnicized form  making it difficult to say whether such a word is natively Finnic or Slavic       Other The Czech word robot is now found in most languages worldwide  and the word pistol  probably also from Czech      is found in many European languages  such as Greek          A well known Slavic word in almost all European languages is vodka  a borrowing from Russian        vodka    which itself was borrowed from Polish w dka  lit   little water    from common Slavic voda   water   cognate to the English word  with the diminutive ending   ka           Owing to the medieval fur trade with Northern Russia  Pan European loans from Russian include such familiar words as sable      The English word  vampire  was borrowed  perhaps via French vampire  from German Vampir  in turn derived from Serbian vampir  continuing Proto Slavic   pyr           although Polish scholar K  Stachowski has argued that the origin of the word is early Slavic  v p r   going back to Turkic oobyr      Several European languages  including English  have borrowed the word polje  meaning  large  flat plain   directly from the former Yugoslav languages  i e  Slovene  Croatian  and Serbian   During the heyday of the USSR in the   th century  many more Russian words became known worldwide  da  Soviet  sputnik  perestroika  glasnost  kolkhoz  etc  Also in the English language borrowed from Russian is samovar  lit   self boiling   to refer to the specific Russian tea urn   Detailed list

Slavic and other regional forms  The Bulgarian Orthodox Church  Russian Orthodox Church  Polish Orthodox Church  Macedonian Orthodox Church  Serbian Orthodox Church  and even some Roman Catholic Churches in Croatia continue to use Church Slavonic as a liturgical language  While not used in modern times  the text of a Church Slavonic Roman Rite Mass survives in Croatia and the Czech Republic          which is best known through Jan  ek s musical setting of it  the Glagolitic Mass   Interslavic language  a modernized and simplified form of Old Church Slavonic  largely based on material that the modern Slavic languages have in common  Its purpose is to facilitate communication between representatives of different Slavic nations and to allow people who do not know any Slavic language to communicate with Slavs  Because Old Church Slavonic had become too archaic and complex for everyday communication  Pan Slavic language projects have been created from the   th century onwards in order to provide the Slavs with a common literary language  Interslavic in its current form was standardized in      after the merger of several older projects      See also Slavic microlanguages Slavistics
