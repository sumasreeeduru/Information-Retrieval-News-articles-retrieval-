United States  in the late   th and early   th centuries  with its roots in blues and ragtime           Since the     s Jazz Age  it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music  linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage     Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes  complex chords  call and response vocals  polyrhythms and improvisation  Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression  and in African American music traditions        As jazz spread around the world  it drew on national  regional  and local musical cultures  which gave rise to different styles  New Orleans jazz began in the early     s  combining earlier brass band marches  French quadrilles  biguine  ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation  In the     s  heavily arranged dance oriented swing big bands  Kansas City jazz  a hard swinging  bluesy  improvisational style and Gypsy jazz  a style that emphasized musette waltzes  were the prominent styles  Bebop emerged in the     s  shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging  musician s music  which was played at faster tempos and used more chord based improvisation  Cool jazz developed near the end of the     s  introducing calmer  smoother sounds and long  linear melodic lines  The mid     s saw the emergence of hard bop  which introduced influences from rhythm and blues  gospel  and blues  especially in the saxophone and piano playing  Modal jazz developed in the late     s  using the mode  or musical scale  as the basis of musical structure and improvisation  as did free jazz  which explored playing without regular meter  beat and formal structures  Jazz rock fusion appeared in the late     s and early     s  combining jazz improvisation with rock music s rhythms  electric instruments  and highly amplified stage sound  In the early     s  a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful  garnering significant radio airplay  Other styles and genres abound in the     s  such as Latin and Afro Cuban jazz   Contents    Etymology and definition   Elements and

early contribution to the genre s etymology The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research  and its history is well documented  It is believed to be related to jasm  a slang term dating back to      meaning  pep  energy      The earliest written record of the word is in a      article in the Los Angeles Times in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a  jazz ball   because it wobbles and you simply can t do anything with it      The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as      in the Chicago Daily Tribune     Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November           Times Picayune article about  jas bands      In an interview with National Public Radio  musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the slang connotations of the term  saying   When Broadway picked it up  they called it  J A Z Z    It wasn t called that  It was spelled  J A S S   That was dirty  and if you knew what it was  you wouldn t say it in front of ladies       The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the   th Century        Albert Gleizes        Composition for  Jazz  from the Solomon R  Guggenheim Museum  New York Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over     years  from ragtime to the rock infused fusion  Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions  such as European music history or African music  But critic Joachim Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader      defining jazz as a  form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music      and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a  special relationship to time defined as  swing    Jazz involves  a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role  and contains a  sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician       In the opinion of Robert Christgau   most of us would say that inventing meaning while letting loose is the essence and promise of jazz       A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson   it is music that includes qualities such as swing  improvising  group interaction  developing an  individual voice   and being open to different musical possibilities       Krin Gibbard argued that  jazz is a construct  which designates  a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition       In contrast to commentators who have argued for excluding types of jazz  musicians are sometimes reluctant to define the music they play  Duke Ellington  one of jazz s most famous figures  said   It s all music        Elements and issues Improvisation Main article  Jazz improvisation Although jazz is considered difficult to define  in part because it contains many subgenres  improvisation is one of its defining elements  The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as blues  a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African American slaves on plantations  These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive call and response pattern  but early blues was also improvisational  Classical music performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score  with less attention given to interpretation  ornamentation  and accompaniment  The classical performer s goal is to play the composition as it was written  In contrast  jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration  placing less value on the contribution of the composer  if there is one  and more on the performer      The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways  never playing the same composition twice  Depending on the performer s mood  experience  and interaction with band members or audience members  the performer may change melodies  harmonies  and time signatures      In early Dixieland  a k a  New Orleans jazz  performers took turns playing melodies and improvising countermelodies  In the swing era of the     s    s  big bands relied more on arrangements which were written or learned by ear and memorized  Soloists improvised within these arrangements  In the bebop era of the     s  big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the piece was improvised  Modal jazz abandoned chord progressions to allow musicians to improvise even more  In many forms of jazz  a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of one or more chordal instruments  piano  guitar   double bass  and drums  The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the composition structure and complement the soloist      In avant garde and free jazz  the separation of soloist and band is reduced  and there is license  or even a requirement  for the abandoning of chords  scales  and meters   Tradition and race Since the emergence of bebop  forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized  According to Bruce Johnson  there has always been a  tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form       Traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop  free jazz  and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal  An alternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles      By avoiding the creation of norms  jazz allows avant garde styles to emerge      For some African Americans  jazz has drawn attention to African American contributions to culture and history  For others  jazz is a reminder of  an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions       Amiri Baraka argues that there is a  white jazz  genre that expresses whiteness      White jazz musicians appeared in the midwest and in other areas throughout the U S  Papa Jack Laine  who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the     s  was called  the father of white jazz       The Original Dixieland Jazz Band  whose members were white  were the first jazz group to record  and Bix Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the     s      The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians such as Eddie Condon  Bud Freeman  Jimmy McPartland  and Dave Tough  Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of swing during the     s      Many bands included both black and white musicians  These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the U S       Roles of women  Ethel Waters sang  Stormy Weather  at the Cotton Club  Main article  Women in jazz Female jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz throughout its history  Although Betty Carter  Ella Fitzgerald  Adelaide Hall  Billie Holiday  Abbey Lincoln  Anita O Day  Dinah Washington  and Ethel Waters were recognized for their vocal talent  less familiar were bandleaders  composers  and instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong  trumpeter Valaida Snow  and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields  Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early     s  drawing particular recognition on piano      When male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II  many all female bands replaced them      The International Sweethearts of Rhythm  which was founded in       was a popular band that became the first all female integrated band in the U S  and the first to travel with the USO  touring Europe in       Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson  Beginning in the     s  many women jazz instrumentalists were prominent  some sustaining long careers  Some of the most distinctive improvisers  composers  and bandleaders in jazz have been women      Trombonist Melba Liston is acknowledged as the first female horn player to work in major bands and to make a real impact on jazz  not only as a musician but also as a respected composer and arranger  particularly through her collaborations with Randy Weston from the late     s into the     s           Origins and early history Jazz originated in the late   th to early   th century as interpretations of American and European classical music entwined with African and slave folk songs and the influences of West African culture      Its composition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each performer s personal interpretation and improvisation  which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre       Blended African and European music sensibilities  Dance in Congo Square in the late     s  artist s conception by E  W  Kemble from a century later  In the late   th century painting The Old Plantation  African Americans dance to banjo and percussion  By the   th century  slaves in the New Orleans area gathered socially at a special market  in an area which later became known as Congo Square  famous for its African dances      By       the Atlantic slave trade had brought nearly         Africans to North America      The slaves came largely from West Africa and the greater Congo River basin and brought strong musical traditions with them      The African traditions primarily use a single line melody and call and response pattern  and the rhythms have a counter metric structure and reflect African speech patterns      An      account says that they were making strange music  Creole  on an equally strange variety of  instruments  washboards  washtubs  jugs  boxes beaten with sticks or bones and a drum made by stretching skin over a flour barrel         Lavish festivals with African based dances to drums were organized on Sundays at Place Congo  or Congo Square  in New Orleans until           There are historical accounts of other music and dance gatherings elsewhere in the southern United States  Robert Palmer said of percussive slave music   Usually such music was associated with annual festivals  when the year s crop was harvested and several days were set aside for celebration  As late as       a traveler in North Carolina saw dancers dressed in costumes that included horned headdresses and cow tails and heard music provided by a sheepskin covered  gumbo box   apparently a frame drum  triangles and jawbones furnished the auxiliary percussion  There are quite a few  accounts  from the southeastern states and Louisiana dating from the period            Some of the earliest  Mississippi  Delta settlers came from the vicinity of New Orleans  where drumming was never actively discouraged for very long and homemade drums were used to accompany public dancing until the outbreak of the Civil War       Another influence came from the harmonic style of hymns of the church  which black slaves had learned and incorporated into their own music as spirituals      The origins of the blues are undocumented  though they can be seen as the secular counterpart of the spirituals  However  as Gerhard Kubik points out  whereas the spirituals are homophonic  rural blues and early jazz  was largely based on concepts of heterophony         The blackface Virginia Minstrels in       featuring tambourine  fiddle  banjo and bones During the early   th century an increasing number of black musicians learned to play European instruments  particularly the violin  which they used to parody European dance music in their own cakewalk dances  In turn  European American minstrel show performers in blackface popularized the music internationally  combining syncopation with European harmonic accompaniment  In the mid     s the white New Orleans composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other Caribbean islands into piano salon music  New Orleans was the main nexus between the Afro Caribbean and African American cultures   African rhythmic retention See also  Traditional sub Saharan African harmony The Black Codes outlawed drumming by slaves  which meant that African drumming traditions were not preserved in North America  unlike in Cuba  Haiti  and elsewhere in the Caribbean  African based rhythmic patterns were retained in the United States in large part through  body rhythms  such as stomping  clapping  and patting juba dancing      In the opinion of jazz historian Ernest Borneman  what preceded New Orleans jazz before      was  Afro Latin music   similar to what was played in the Caribbean at the time      A three stroke pattern known in Cuban music as tresillo is a fundamental rhythmic figure heard in many different slave musics of the Caribbean  as well as the Afro Caribbean folk dances performed in New Orleans Congo Square and Gottschalk s compositions  for example  Souvenirs From Havana           Tresillo  shown below  is the most basic and most prevalent duple pulse rhythmic cell in sub Saharan African music traditions and the music of the African Diaspora           Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Tresillo is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music and in other forms of popular music from that city from the turn of the   th century to present       By and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns survived in jazz     because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions   jazz historian Gunther Schuller observed   Some survived  others were discarded as the Europeanization progressed       In the post Civil War period  after        African Americans were able to obtain surplus military bass drums  snare drums and fifes  and an original African American drum and fife music emerged  featuring tresillo and related syncopated rhythmic figures      This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean counterparts  expressing a uniquely African American sensibility   The snare and bass drummers played syncopated cross rhythms   observed the writer Robert Palmer  speculating that  this tradition must have dated back to the latter half of the nineteenth century  and it could have not have developed in the first place if there hadn t been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured        Afro Cuban influence Further information  Music of African heritage in Cuba African American music began incorporating Afro Cuban rhythmic motifs in the   th century when the habanera  Cuban contradanza  gained international popularity      Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice daily ferry between both cities to perform  and the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City  John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera  reached the U S  twenty years before the first rag was published       For the more than quarter century in which the cakewalk  ragtime  and proto jazz were forming and developing  the habanera was a consistent part of African American popular music      Habaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically based on an African motif             From the perspective of African American music  the  habanera rhythm   also known as  congo         tango congo       or tango      can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat      The habanera was the first of many Cuban music genres which enjoyed periods of popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo based rhythms in African American music   Musical scores are temporarily disabled  New Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk s piano piece  Ojos Criollos  Danse Cubaine          was influenced by the composer s studies in Cuba  the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand          In Gottschalk s symphonic work  A Night in the Tropics          the tresillo variant cinquillo  appears extensively      The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers   Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba  Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans  clav    a Spanish word meaning  code  or  key   as in the key to a puzzle  or mystery      Although the pattern is only half a clave  Marsalis makes the point that the single celled figure is the guide pattern of New Orleans music  Jelly Roll Morton called the rhythmic figure the Spanish tinge and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz       Ragtime Main article  Ragtime  Scott Joplin in      The abolition of slavery in      led to new opportunities for the education of freed African Americans  Although strict segregation limited employment opportunities for most blacks  many were able to find work in entertainment  Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances  minstrel shows  and in vaudeville  during which time many marching bands were formed  Black pianists played in bars  clubs  and brothels  as ragtime developed          Ragtime appeared as sheet music  popularized by African American musicians such as the entertainer Ernest Hogan  whose hit songs appeared in       Two years later  Vess Ossman recorded a medley of these songs as a banjo solo known as  Rag Time Medley           Also in       the white composer William Krell published his  Mississippi Rag  as the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece  and Tom Turpin published his  Harlem Rag   the first rag published by an African American  Classically trained pianist Scott Joplin produced his  Original Rags  in      and  in       had an international hit with  Maple Leaf Rag   a multi strain ragtime march with four parts that feature recurring themes and a bass line with copious seventh chords  Its structure was the basis for many other rags  and the syncopations in the right hand  especially in the transition between the first and second strain  were novel at the time      The last four measures of Scott Joplin s  Maple Leaf Rag         are shown below   Musical scores are temporarily disabled  African based rhythmic patterns such as tresillo and its variants  the habanera rhythm and cinquillo  are heard in the ragtime compositions of Joplin and Turpin  Joplin s  Solace         is generally considered to be in the habanera genre          both of the pianist s hands play in a syncopated fashion  completely abandoning any sense of a march rhythm  Ned Sublette postulates that the tresillo habanera rhythm  found its way into ragtime and the cakewalk       whilst Roberts suggests that  the habanera influence may have been part of what freed black music from ragtime s European bass        Blues Main article  Blues African genesis Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Musical scores are temporarily disabled A hexatonic blues scale on C  ascendingBlues is the name given to both a musical form and a music genre      which originated in African American communities of primarily the Deep South of the United States at the end of the   th century from their spirituals  work songs  field hollers  shouts and chants and rhymed simple narrative ballads      The African use of pentatonic scales contributed to the development of blue notes in blues and jazz      As Kubik explains   Many of the rural blues of the Deep South are stylistically an extension and merger of basically two broad accompanied song style traditions in the west central Sudanic belt  A strongly Arabic Islamic song style  as found for example among the Hausa  It is characterized by melisma  wavy intonation  pitch instabilities within a pentatonic framework  and a declamatory voice  An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of pentatonic song composition  often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter  but with notable off beat accents                 W  C  Handy  early published blues  W  C  Handy at          W  C  Handy became interested in folk blues of the Deep South while traveling through the Mississippi Delta  In this folk blues form  the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range  sounding like a field holler  and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed  like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents  functioning as another  voice       Handy and his band members were formally trained African American musicians who had not grown up with the blues  yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form  Handy wrote about his adopting of the blues   The primitive southern Negro  as he sang  was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale  slurring between major and minor  Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St  Louis way  it was always the same  Till then  however  I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro  or by any white man  I tried to convey this effect     by introducing flat thirds and sevenths  now called blue notes  into my song  although its prevailing key was major       and I carried this device into my melody as well      The publication of his  Memphis Blues  sheet music in      introduced the    bar blues to the world  although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues  but  more like a cakewalk        This composition  as well as his later  St  Louis Blues  and others  included the habanera rhythm      and would become jazz standards  Handy s music career began in the pre jazz era and contributed to the codification of jazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music   New Orleans Main article  Dixieland  The Bolden Band around      The music of New Orleans had a profound effect on the creation of early jazz  In New Orleans  slaves could practice elements of their culture such as voodoo and playing drums      Many early jazz musicians played in the bars and brothels of the red light district around Basin Street called Storyville      In addition to dance bands  there were marching bands which played at lavish funerals  later called jazz funerals   The instruments used by marching bands and dance bands became the instruments of jazz  brass  drums  and reeds tuned in the European    tone scale  Small bands contained a combination of self taught and formally educated musicians  many from the funeral procession tradition  These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south  Beginning in       Creole and African American musicians played in vaudeville shows which carried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U S      In New Orleans  a white bandleader named Papa Jack Laine integrated blacks and whites in his marching band  He was known as  the father of white jazz  because of the many top players he employed  such as George Brunies  Sharkey Bonano  and future members of the Original Dixieland Jass Band  During the early     s  jazz was mostly performed in African American and mulatto communities due to segregation laws  Storyville brought jazz to a wider audience through tourists who visited the port city of New Orleans      Many jazz musicians from African American communities were hired to perform in bars and brothels  These included Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton in addition to those from other communities  such as Lorenzo Tio and Alcide Nunez  Louis Armstrong started his career in Storyville     and found success in Chicago  Storyville was shut down by the U S  government in            Syncopation  Jelly Roll Morton  in Los Angeles  California  c       or      Cornetist Buddy Bolden played in New Orleans from      to       No recordings by him exist  His band is credited with creating the big four  the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on the beat march      As the example below shows  the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm   Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Afro Creole pianist Jelly Roll Morton began his career in Storyville  Beginning in       he toured with vaudeville shows to southern cities  Chicago  and New York City  In       he composed  Jelly Roll Blues   which became the first jazz arrangement in print when it was published in       In introduced more musicians to the New Orleans style      Morton considered the tresillo habanera  which he called the Spanish tinge  an essential ingredient of jazz       Now in one of my earliest tunes   New Orleans Blues   you can notice the Spanish tinge  In fact  if you can t manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes  you will never be able to get the right seasoning  I call it  for jazz       An excerpt of  New Orleans Blues  is shown below  In the excerpt  the left hand plays the tresillo rhythm  while the right hand plays variations on cinquillo   Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Morton was a crucial innovator in the evolution from the early jazz form known as ragtime to jazz piano  and could perform pieces in either style  in       Morton made a series of recordings for the Library of Congress in which he demonstrated the difference between the two styles  Morton s solos  however  were still close to ragtime  and were not merely improvisations over chord changes as in later jazz  but his use of the blues was of equal importance   Swing in the early   th century Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Musical scores are temporarily disabled Morton loosened ragtime s rigid rhythmic feeling  decreasing its embellishments and employing a swing feeling      Swing is the most important and enduring African based rhythmic technique used in jazz  An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is   if you don t feel it  you ll never know it       The New Harvard Dictionary of Music states that swing is   An intangible rhythmic momentum in jazz   Swing defies analysis  claims to its presence may inspire arguments   The dictionary does nonetheless provide the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat contrasted with duple subdivisions      swing superimposes six subdivisions of the beat over a basic pulse structure or four subdivisions  This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in African American music than in Afro Caribbean music  One aspect of swing  which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics  places strokes in between the triple and duple pulse  grids       New Orleans brass bands are a lasting influence  contributing horn players to the world of professional jazz with the distinct sound of the city whilst helping black children escape poverty  The leader of New Orleans  Camelia Brass Band  D Jalma Ganier  taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet  Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing  and then expand it  Like Jelly Roll Morton  Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime s stiffness in favor of swung notes  Armstrong  perhaps more than any other musician  codified the rhythmic technique of swing in jazz and broadened the jazz solo vocabulary      The Original Dixieland Jass Band made the music s first recordings early in       and their  Livery Stable Blues  became the earliest released jazz record                              That year  numerous other bands made recordings featuring  jazz  in the title or band name  but most were ragtime or novelty records rather than jazz  In February      during World War I  James Reese Europe s  Hellfighters  infantry band took ragtime to Europe          then on their return recorded Dixieland standards including  Darktown Strutters  Ball        Other regions In the northeastern United States  a  hot  style of playing ragtime had developed  notably James Reese Europe s symphonic Clef Club orchestra in New York City  which played a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in                The Baltimore rag style of Eubie Blake influenced James P  Johnson s development of stride piano playing  in which the right hand plays the melody  while the left hand provides the rhythm and bassline       In Ohio and elsewhere in the mid west the major influence was ragtime  until about       Around       when the four string banjo and saxophone came in  musicians began to improvise the melody line  but the harmony and rhythm remained unchanged  A contemporary account states that blues could only be heard in jazz in the gut bucket cabarets  which were generally looked down upon by the Black middle class        The Jazz Age Main article  Jazz Age  The King   Carter Jazzing Orchestra

 Jazz Age   hosting popular music  dance songs  novelty songs  and show tunes  Jazz began to get a reputation as immoral  and many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old cultural values by promoting the decadent values of the Roaring   s  Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote       it is not music at all  It s merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing  a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion        The New York Times reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears  but the villagers had used pots and pans  another story

polyphonic  with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation  Armstrong was a master of his hometown style  but by the time he joined Henderson s band  he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz  with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists  Armstrong s solos went well beyond the theme improvisation concept and extemporized on chords  rather than melodies  According to Schuller  by comparison  the solos by Armstrong s bandmates  including a young Coleman Hawkins   sounded  stiff  stodgy   with  jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality        The

was reaching the height of its popularity  Duke Ellington spent the late     s and     s developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra  Abandoning the conventions of swing  he experimented with orchestral sounds  harmony  and musical form with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences  some of his tunes became hits  and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe       Ellington called his music American Music  rather than jazz  and liked to describe those who impressed him as  beyond category        These included many musicians from his orchestra  some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right  but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most popular jazz orchestras in the history of jazz  He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals  such as  Jeep s Blues  for Johnny Hodges   Concerto for Cootie  for Cootie Williams  which later became  Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me  with Bob Russell s lyrics   and  The Mooche  for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley  He also recorded compositions written by his bandsmen  such as Juan Tizol s  Caravan  and  Perdido   which brought the  Spanish Tinge  to big band jazz  Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades  The band reached a creative peak in the early     s  when Ellington and a small hand picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity        Beginnings of European jazz As only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe  European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe  Paul Whiteman  and Lonnie Johnson  who visited Europe during and after World War I  It was their live performances which inspired European audiences  interest in jazz  as well as the interest in all things American  and therefore exotic  which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time       The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period  British jazz began with a tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in       In       Fred Elizalde and His Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC  Thereafter jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras  and jazz instrumentalists became numerous       This style entered full swing in France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France  which began in       Much of this French jazz was a combination of African American jazz and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well trained  in this  it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since his style was also a fusion of the two       Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz  a mix of     s American swing  French dance hall  musette   and Eastern European folk with a languid  seductive feel  the main instruments were steel stringed guitar  violin  and double bass  Solos pass from one player to another as guitar and bass form the rhythm section  Some researchers believe Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti pioneered the guitar violin partnership characteristic of the genre       which was brought to France after they had been heard live or on Okeh Records in the late     s        Post war jazz See also      s in jazz      s in jazz      s in jazz  and     s in jazz The outbreak of World War II marked a turning point for jazz  The swing era jazz of the previous decade had challenged other popular music as being representative of the nation s culture  with big bands reaching the height of the style s success by the early     s  swing acts and big bands traveled with U S  military overseas to Europe  where it also became popular       Stateside  however  the war presented difficulties for the big band format  conscription shortened the number of musicians available  the military s need for shellac  commonly used for pressing gramophone records  limited record production  a shortage of rubber  also due to the war effort  discouraged bands from touring via road travel  and a demand by the musicians  union for a commercial recording ban limited music distribution between      and            Many of the big bands who were deprived of experienced musicians because of the war effort began to enlist young players who were below the age for conscription  as was the case with saxophonist Stan Getz s entry in a band as a teenager       This coincided with a nationwide resurgence in the Dixieland style of pre swing jazz  performers such as clarinetist George Lewis  cornetist Bill Davison  and trombonist Turk Murphy were hailed by conservative jazz critics as more authentic than the big bands       Elsewhere  with the limitations on recording  small groups of young musicians developed a more uptempo  improvisational style of jazz       collaborating and experimenting with new ideas for melodic development  rhythmic language  and harmonic substitution  during informal  late night jam sessions hosted in small clubs and apartments  Key figures in this development were largely based in New York and included pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell  drummers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke  saxophonist Charlie Parker  and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie       This musical development became known as bebop       Bebop and subsequent post war jazz developments featured a wider set of notes  played in more complex patterns and at faster tempos than previous jazz       According to Clive James  bebop was  the post war musical development which tried to ensure that jazz would no longer be the spontaneous sound of joy     Students of race relations in America are generally agreed that the exponents of post war jazz were determined  with good reason  to present themselves as challenging artists rather than tame entertainers        The end of the war marked  a revival of the spirit of experimentation and musical pluralism under which it had been conceived   along with  the beginning of a decline in the popularity of jazz music in America   according to American academic Michael H  Burchett       With the rise of bebop and the end of the swing era after the war  jazz lost its cachet as pop music  Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers  these included Frank Sinatra  Peggy Lee  Dick Haymes  and Doris Day       Older musicians who still performed their pre war jazz  such as Armstrong and Ellington  were gradually viewed in the mainstream as pass   Other younger performers  such as singer Big Joe Turner and saxophonist Louis Jordan  who were discouraged by bebop s increasing complexity pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues  jump blues  and eventually rock and roll       Some  including Gillespie  composed intricate yet danceable pieces for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible  but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences  purview   The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim  but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences   Burchett said   The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences  while retaining its artistic integrity  is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz        During its swing period  jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene  according to Paul Trynka  this changed in the post war years   Suddenly jazz was no longer straightforward  There was bebop and its variants  there was the last gasp of swing  there were strange new brews like the progressive jazz of Stan Kenton  and there was a completely new phenomenon called revivalism   the rediscovery of jazz from the past  either on old records or performed live by ageing players brought out of retirement  From now on it was no good saying that you liked jazz  you had to specify what kind of jazz  And that is the way it has been ever since  only more so  Today  the word  jazz  is virtually meaningless without further definition       Bebop Main article  Bebop In the early     s  bebop style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging  musician s music   The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker  pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk  trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown  and drummer Max Roach  Divorcing itself from dance music  bebop established itself more as an art form  thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal  Composer Gunther Schuller wrote   In      I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians  They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work  Two years later I read that that was  bop  and the beginning of modern jazz     but the band never made recordings        Dizzy Gillespie wrote   People talk about the Hines band being  the incubator of bop  and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band  But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new  It was not  The music evolved from what went before  It was the same basic music  The difference was in how you got from here to here to here   naturally each age has got its own shit        Since bebop was meant to be listened to  not danced to  it could use faster tempos  Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style  in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents  This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity       Bebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz  engaging in a more abstracted form of chord based improvisation  Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note       bebop also uses  passing  chords  substitute chords  and altered chords  New forms of chromaticism and dissonance were introduced into jazz  and the dissonant tritone  or  flatted fifth   interval became the  most important interval of bebop       Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing era tunes and reused with a new and more complex melody and or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions  a practice which was already well established in earlier jazz  but came to be central to the bebop style  Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions  such as blues  at base  I IV V  but often infused with ii V motion  and  rhythm changes   I VI ii V    the chords to the     s pop standard  I Got Rhythm   Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes  The harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing  Cherokee  at Clark Monroe s Uptown House  New York  in early        I d been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used   and I kept thinking there s bound to be something else  I could hear it sometimes  I couldn t play it   I was working over  Cherokee   and  as I did  I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes  I could play the thing I d been hearing  It came alive        Gerhard Kubik postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and African related tonal sensibilities rather than   th century Western classical music   Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in  Parker s  life  reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system  a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories  Bebop musicians eliminated Western style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices        Samuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop  bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety  a developed and even more highly syncopated  linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic harmonic device  and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle       Kubik wrote   While for an outside observer  the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western  serious  music  from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg  such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach  Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz  for example  on Bix Beiderbecke s piano playing  And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music  West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz  but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings  On the contrary  ideologically  bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism  propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self  Bebop then revived tonal harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non Western harmonic approach  The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the     s brought back to African American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions       These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided  sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians  especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds  To hostile critics  bebop seemed filled with  racing  nervous phrases        But despite the friction  by the     s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary   Afro Cuban jazz  cu bop  Main article  Afro Cuban jazz  Machito  maracas  and his sister Graciella Grillo  claves  Machito and Mario Bauza The general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was  Tanga          composed by Cuban born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro Cubans in New York City   Tanga  began as a spontaneous descarga  Cuban jam session   with jazz solos superimposed on top       This was the birth of Afro Cuban jazz  The use of clave brought the African timeline  or key pattern  into jazz  Music organized around key patterns convey a two celled  binary  structure  which is a complex level of African cross rhythm       Within the context of jazz  however  harmony is the primary referent  not rhythm  The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave  and the harmonic  one  is always understood to be  one   If the progression begins on the  three side  of clave  it is said to be in     clave  shown below   If the progression begins on the  two side   it is in     clave        Musical scores are temporarily disabled  Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo  Dizzy Gillespie       Mario Bauz  introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer Chano Pozo  Gillespie and Pozo s brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro Cuban jazz standards   Manteca         is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave  According to Gillespie  Pozo composed the layered  contrapuntal guajeos  Afro Cuban ostinatos  of the A section and the introduction  while Gillespie wrote the bridge  Gillespie recounted   If I d let it go like  Chano  wanted it  it would have been strictly Afro Cuban all the way  There wouldn t have been a bridge  I thought I was writing an eight bar bridge  but     I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen bar bridge        The bridge gave  Manteca  a typical jazz harmonic structure  setting the piece apart from Bauza s modal  Tanga  of a few years earlier  Gillespie s collaboration with Pozo brought specific African based rhythms into bebop  While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation  cu bop also drew from African rhythm  Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section  with all choruses swung during solos  became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire  This approach can be heard on pre      recordings of  Manteca    A Night in Tunisia    Tin Tin Deo   and  On Green Dolphin Street    African cross rhythm  Mongo Santamaria        Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaria first recorded his composition  Afro Blue  in             Afro Blue  was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three against two       cross rhythm  or hemiola       The piece begins with the bass repeatedly playing   cross beats per each measure of      or   cross beats per   main beats      two cells of       The following example shows the original ostinato  Afro Blue  bass line  The cross noteheads indicate the main beats  not bass notes     When John Coltrane covered  Afro Blue  in       he inverted the metric hierarchy  interpreting the tune as a    jazz waltz with duple cross beats superimposed        Originally a B  pentatonic blues  Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of  Afro Blue   Perhaps the most respected Afro cuban jazz combo of the late     s was vibraphonist Cal Tjader s band  Tjader had Mongo Santamaria  Armando Peraza  and Willie Bobo on his early recording dates   Dixieland revival In the late     s  there was a revival of Dixieland  harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style  This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver  Morton  and Armstrong bands of the     s  There were two types of musicians involved in the revival  the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it  or continuing what they had been playing all along   such as Bob Crosby s Bobcats  Max Kaminsky  Eddie Condon  and Wild Bill Davison       Most of these players were originally Midwesterners  although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved  The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians  such as those in the Lu Watters band  Conrad Janis  and Ward Kimball and his Firehouse Five Plus Two Jazz Band  By the late     s  Louis Armstrong s Allstars band became a leading ensemble  Through the     s and     s  Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US  Europe  and Japan  although critics paid little attention to it             Take The  A  Train   This      sample of Duke Ellington s signature

 rhythm and blues  and gospel  especially in saxophone and piano playing  Hard bop was developed in the mid     s  coalescing in      and       it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early     s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues  Miles Davis       performance of  Walkin   at the first Newport Jazz Festival announced the style to the jazz world       The quintet Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers  led by Blakey and featuring pianist Horace Silver and trumpeter Clifford Brown  were leaders in the hard bop movement with Davis   Modal jazz Main article  Modal jazz Modal jazz is a development which began in the later     s which takes the mode  or musical scale  as the basis of musical structure and improvisation  Previously  a solo was meant to fit into a given chord progression  but with modal jazz  the soloist creates a melody using one  or a small number of  modes  The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody        Historically  this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians  away from thinking vertically  the chord   and towards a more horizontal approach  the scale         explained pianist Mark Levine  The modal theory stems from a work by George Russell  Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with Kind of Blue         an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time  In contrast to Davis  earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation  Kind of Blue was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style        I didn t write out the music for Kind of Blue  but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity        recalled Davis  The track  So What  has only two chords  D   and E          Other innovators in this style include Jackie McLean       and two of the musicians who had also played on Kind of Blue  John Coltrane and Bill Evans   Free jazz Main article  Free jazz  John Coltrane       Free jazz  and the related form of avant garde jazz  broke through into an open space of  free tonality  in which meter  beat  and formal symmetry all disappeared  and a range of world music from India  Africa  and Arabia were melded into an intense  even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing       While loosely inspired by bebop  free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude  the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed  The bassist Charles Mingus is also frequently associated with the avant garde in jazz  although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres  The first major stirrings came in the     s with the early work of Ornette Coleman  whose      album Free Jazz  A Collective Improvisation coined the term  and Cecil Taylor  In the     s  exponents included Albert Ayler  Gato Barbieri  Carla Bley  Don Cherry  Larry Coryell  John Coltrane  Bill Dixon  Jimmy Giuffre  Steve Lacy  Michael Mantler  Sun Ra  Roswell Rudd  Pharoah Sanders  and John Tchicai  In developing his late style  Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler s trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray  a rhythm section honed with Cecil Taylor as leader  In November       Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard  which resulted in the classic Chasin  the  Trane  which Down Beat magazine panned as  anti jazz   On his      tour of France  he was booed  but persevered  signing with the new Impulse  Records in      and turning it into  the house that Trane built   while championing many younger free jazz musicians  notably Archie Shepp  who often played with trumpeter Bill Dixon  who organized the   day  October Revolution in Jazz  in Manhattan in       the first free jazz festival  A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of      show Coltrane s playing becoming increasingly abstract  with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics  utilization of overtones  and playing in the altissimo register  as well as a mutated return to Coltrane s sheets of sound  In the studio  he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone  In addition  the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom   The group s evolution can be traced through the recordings The John Coltrane Quartet Plays  Living Space and Transition  both June        New Thing at Newport  July        Sun Ship  August        and First Meditations  September        In June       Coltrane and    other musicians recorded Ascension  a    minute long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante garde musicians as well as Coltrane  and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos  Dave Liebman later called it  the torch that lit the free jazz thing     After recording with the quartet over the next few months  Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September        While Coltrane used over blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation point  Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo  resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument   Free jazz in Europe  Peter Br tzmann is a key figure in European free jazz  Free jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler  Taylor  Steve Lacy  and Eric Dolphy spent extended periods of time there  and European musicians such as Michael Mantler and John Tchicai traveled to the U S  to experience American music firsthand  European contemporary jazz was shaped by Peter Br tzmann  John Surman  Krzysztof Komeda  Zbigniew Namys owski  Tomasz Stanko  Lars Gullin  Joe Harriott  Albert Mangelsdorff  Kenny Wheeler  Graham Collier  Michael Garrick and Mike Westbrook  They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage  Since the     s  creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed  such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam  Following the work of drummer Han Bennink and pianist Misha Mengelberg  musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form  melody  rhythm  a famous song  is found  Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP  Instant Composers Pool  orchestra in his book New Dutch Swing  Since the     s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism  British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory        Latin jazz Main article  Latin jazz Latin jazz is jazz that employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America  A more precise term might be Afro Latin jazz  as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz  The two main categories of Latin jazz are Afro Cuban jazz and Brazilian jazz  In the     s and     s  many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music  and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as  Latin tunes   with no distinction between a Cuban son montuno and a Brazilian bossa nova  Even as late as       in Mark Gridley s Jazz Styles  History and Analysis  a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a  Latin bass figure        It was not uncommon during the     s and     s to hear a conga playing a Cuban tumbao while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern  Many jazz standards such as  Manteca    On Green Dolphin Street  and  Song for My Father  have a  Latin  A section and a swung B section  Typically  the band would only play an even eighth  Latin  feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos  Latin jazz specialists like Cal Tjader tended to be the exception  For example  on a      live Tjader recording of  A Night in Tunisia   pianist Vince Guaraldi soloed through the entire form over an authentic mambo        Afro Cuban jazz renaissance For most of its history  Afro Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms  But by the end of the     s  a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both salsa dance music and jazz  leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms  This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry  congas and trumpet  and Andy  bass        During            they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri s most experimental salsa groups  salsa was the medium  but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways  He incorporated parallel fourths  with McCoy Tyner type vamps  The innovations of Palmieri  the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City  This occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba      The first Cuban band of this new wave was Irakere  Their  Ch kere son         introduced a style of  Cubanized  bebop flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time  It was based on Charlie Parker s composition  Billie s Bounce   jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines       In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere s Afro Cuban folkloric   jazz fusion  their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz  their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as timba   Afro Brazilian jazz  Nan  Vasconcelos playing the Afro Brazilian Berimbau Brazilian jazz  such as bossa nova  is derived from samba  with influences from jazz and other   th century classical and popular music styles  Bossa is generally moderately paced  with melodies sung in Portuguese or English  whilst the related jazz samba is an adaptation of street samba into jazz  The bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians Jo o Gilberto and Ant nio Carlos Jobim and was made popular by Elizete Cardoso s recording of  Chega de Saudade  on the Can  o do Amor Demais LP  Gilberto s initial releases  and the      film Black Orpheus  achieved significant popularity in Latin America  this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians  The resulting recordings by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova s popularity and led to a worldwide boom  with      s Getz Gilberto  numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra  and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music  Brazilian percussionists such as Airto Moreira and Nan  Vasconcelos also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles  thus attracting a greater audience to them                  African inspired  Randy Weston Rhythm The first jazz standard composed by a non Latino to use an overt African     cross rhythm was Wayne Shorter s  Footprints               On the version recorded on Miles Smiles by Miles Davis  the bass switches to a    tresillo figure at        Footprints  is not  however  a Latin jazz tune  African rhythmic structures are accessed directly by Ron Carter  bass  and Tony Williams  drums  via the rhythmic sensibilities of swing  Throughout the piece  the four beats  whether sounded or not  are maintained as the temporal referent  The following example shows the     and    forms of the bass line  The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats  not bass notes   where one ordinarily taps their foot to  keep time     Pentatonic scales The use of pentatonic scales was another trend associated with Africa  The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years       McCoy Tyner perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos       and also used parallel fifths and fourths  which are common harmonies in West Africa       The minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation  and like a blues scale  a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues  The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by Joe Henderson on Horace Silver s  African Queen               Jazz pianist  theorist  and educator Mark Levine refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the V pentatonic scale         C pentatonic scale beginning on the I  C pentatonic   IV  F pentatonic   and V  G pentatonic  steps of the scale  clarification needed  Levine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II V I jazz progression       This is a very common progression  used in pieces such as Miles Davis   Tune Up   The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II V I progression         V pentatonic scale over II V I chord progression  Accordingly  John Coltrane s  Giant Steps          with its    chords per    bars  can be played using only three pentatonic scales  Coltrane studied Nicolas Slonimsky s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns  which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of  Giant Steps        The harmonic complexity of  Giant Steps  is on the level of the most advanced   th century art music  Superimposing the pentatonic scale over  Giant Steps  is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification  but also a sort of  Africanizing  of the piece  which provides an alternate approach for soloing  Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional  playing the changes   pentatonic scales provide  structure and a feeling of increased space         Sacred and liturgical jazz Main article  Sacred jazz As noted above  jazz has incorporated from its inception aspects of African American sacred music including spirituals and hymns  Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals and hymns as part of their repertoire or isolated compositions such as  Come Sunday   part of   Black and Beige Suite  by Duke Ellington  Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black gospel music  However  it was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings and or as religious expression  Since the     s  sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians       The  Abyssinian Mass  by Wynton Marsalis  Blueengine Records        is a recent example  Unfortunately  relatively little has been written about sacred and liturgical jazz  In a      doctoral dissertation  Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the     s using disciplines of musicology and history  He noted that the traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the     s to produce a new genre   sacred jazz        Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz  Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams  known for her jazz masses in the     s and Duke Ellington  Prior to his death in      in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco  Duke Ellington wrote three Sacred Concerts         A Concert of Sacred Music         Second Sacred Concert         Third Sacred Concert  The most prominent form of sacred and liturgical jazz is the jazz mass  Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting  this form has many examples  An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was Mary Lou Williams  Williams converted to Catholicism in       and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom       One was composed in      to honor the recently assassinated Martin Luther King Jr  and the third was commissioned by a pontifical commission  It was performed once in      in St Patrick s Cathedral in New York City  However the Catholic church has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship  In      Joe Masters recorded  Jazz Mass  for Columbia Records  A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass       Other examples include   Jazz Mass in Concert  by Lalo Schiffrin Aleph Records        UPC                and  Jazz Mass  by Vince Guaraldi  Fantasy Records         In England  classical composer Will Todd recorded his  Jazz Missa Brevis  with a jazz ensemble  soloists and the St Martin s Voices on a      Signum Records release   Passion Music Jazz Missa Brevis  also released as  Mass in Blue   and jazz organist James Taylor composed  The Rochester Mass   Cherry Red Records              In       Versace put forth bassist Ike Sturm and New York composer Deanna Witkowski as contemporary exemplars of sacred and liturgical jazz        Jazz fusion Main article  Jazz fusion  Fusion trumpeter Miles Davis in      In the late     s and early     s  the hybrid form of jazz rock fusion was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms  electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa  Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters  odd time signatures  syncopation  complex chords  and harmonies  According to AllMusic       until around       the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate   However       as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved  and as some in the jazz world became bored with hard bop and did not want to play strictly avant garde music  the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces       Miles Davis  new directions In       Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with In a Silent Way  which can be considered his first fusion album  Composed of two side long suites edited heavily by producer Teo Macero  this quiet  static album would be equally influential to the development of ambient music  As Davis recalls   The music I was really listening to in      was James Brown  the great guitar player Jimi Hendrix  and a new group who had just come out with a hit record   Dance to the Music   Sly and the Family Stone     I wanted to make it more like rock  When we recorded In a Silent Way I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that       Two contributors to In a Silent Way also joined organist Larry Young to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums  Emergency         by The Tony Williams Lifetime   Psychedelic jazz Weather Report Weather Report s self titled electronic and psychedelic Weather Report debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in       thanks to the pedigree of the group s members  including percussionist Airto Moreira   and their unorthodox approach to music  The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years  predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing soprano saxophone  and with no synthesizers involved   but is still considered a classic of early fusion  It built on the avant garde experiments which Joe Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew  including an avoidance of head and chorus composition in favour of continuous rhythm and movement   but took the music further  To emphasise the group s rejection of standard methodology  the album opened with the inscrutable avant garde atmospheric piece  Milky Way   which featured by Shorter s extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul s piano strings while the latter pedalled the instrument  Down Beat described the album as  music beyond category   and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine s polls that year  Weather Report s subsequent releases were creative funk jazz works        Jazz rock Although some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock  many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion  As well as the electric instruments of rock  such as electric guitar  electric bass  electric piano and synthesizer keyboards   fusion also used the powerful amplification   fuzz  pedals  wah wah pedals and other effects that were used by     s era rock bands  Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis  Eddie Harris  keyboardists Joe Zawinul  Chick Corea  and Herbie Hancock  vibraphonist Gary Burton  drummer Tony Williams  drummer   violinist Jean Luc Ponty  guitarists Larry Coryell  Al Di Meola  John McLaughlin  Ryo Kawasaki  and Frank Zappa  saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke  Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan  where the band Casiopea released more than thirty fusion albums  According to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson   just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the     s     jazz rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same  with albums such as Williams  Emergency         and Davis  Agharta         which Nicholson said  suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before   This development was stifled by commercialism  Nicholson said  as the genre  mutated into a peculiar species of jazz inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio  at the end of the     s        Jazz funk Main article  Jazz funk By the mid     s  the sound known as jazz funk had developed  characterized by a strong back beat  groove   electrified sounds      and  often  the presence of electronic analog synthesizers  Jazz funk also draws influences from traditional African music  Afro Cuban rhythms and Jamaican reggae  notably Kingston bandleader Sonny Bradshaw  Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition  arrangements  melody and overall writing became important  The integration of funk  soul  and R B music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul  funk or disco with jazz arrangements  jazz riffs and jazz solos  and sometimes soul vocals       Early examples are Herbie Hancock s Headhunters band and Miles Davis  On the Corner album  which  in       began Davis  foray into jazz funk and was  he claimed  an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk  While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed  other tonal and rhythmic textures  such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos  create a multi layered soundscape  The album was a culmination of sorts of the musique concr te approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero had begun to explore in the late     s   Traditionalism in the     s Main article      s in jazz  Wynton Marsalis The     s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the     s  Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade  and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition  rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington  as well as the hard bop of the     s  It is debatable whether Marsalis  critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the     s  particularly modal jazz and post bop   nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism  even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve  For example  several musicians who had been prominent in the fusion genre during the     s began to record acoustic jazz once more  including Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock  Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the     s  for example  Bill Evans  Joe Henderson  and Stan Getz  Even the     s music of Miles Davis  although certainly still fusion  adopted a far more accessible and recognisably jazz oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid     s  such as a return to a theme and solos approach  The emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older  established musicians  groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community  In the     s  the groups of Betty Carter and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz rock  and in addition to difficulty booking their acts  struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as hard bop and bebop  In the late     s  however  a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey s band began to occur  This movement included musicians such as Valery Ponomarev and Bobby Watson  Dennis Irwin and James Williams  In the     s  in addition to Wynton and Branford Marsalis  the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as Donald Brown  Mulgrew Miller  and later  Benny Green  bassists such as Charles Fambrough  Lonnie Plaxico  and later  Peter Washington and Essiet Essiet  horn players such as Bill Pierce  Donald Harrison and later Javon Jackson and Terence Blanchard emerged as talented jazz musicians  all of whom made significant contributions in the     s and     s  The young Jazz Messengers  contemporaries  including Roy Hargrove  Marcus Roberts  Wallace Roney and Mark Whitfield were also influenced by Wynton Marsalis s emphasis toward jazz tradition  These younger rising stars rejected avant garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of Charlie Parker  Thelonious Monk and early recordings of the first Miles Davis quintet  This group of  Young Lions  sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music       In addition  Betty Carter s rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York s preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers  Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni Benny Green  Branford Marsalis and Ralph Peterson Jr   as well as Kenny Washington  Lewis Nash  Curtis Lundy  Cyrus Chestnut  Mark Shim  Craig Handy  Greg Hutchinson and Marc Cary  Taurus Mateen and Geri Allen  O T B  ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as Kenny Garrett  Steve Wilson  Kenny Davis  Renee Rosnes  Ralph Peterson Jr   Billy Drummond  and Robert Hurst       A similar reaction vague  took place against free jazz  According to Ted Gioia   the very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz  Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes  Cecil Taylor played duets in concert with Mary Lou Williams  and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack  And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating  moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice  Musicians such as David Murray or Don Pullen may have felt the call of free form jazz  but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African American music for fun and profit       Pianist Keith Jarrett whose bands of the     s had played only original compositions with prominent free jazz elements established his so called  Standards Trio  in       which  although also occasionally exploring collective improvisation  has primarily performed and recorded jazz standards  Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the     s  having neglected them for the     s  In       the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative John Conyers Jr  to define jazz as a unique form of American music  stating  jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention  support and resources to make certain it is preserved  understood and promulgated   It passed in the House on September           and in the Senate on November                Smooth jazz Main article  Smooth jazz  David Sanborn       In the early     s  a commercial form of jazz fusion called  pop fusion  or  smooth jazz  became successful  garnering significant radio airplay in  quiet storm  time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U S  This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including Al Jarreau  Anita Baker  Chaka Khan  and Sade  as well as saxophonists including Grover Washington Jr   Kenny G  Kirk Whalum  Boney James  and David Sanborn  In general  smooth jazz is downtempo  the most widely played tracks are of        beats per minute   and has a lead melody playing instrument  saxophone  especially soprano and tenor  and legato electric guitar are popular   In his Newsweek article  The Problem With Jazz Criticism        Stanley Crouch considers Miles Davis  playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz  Critic Aaron J  West has countered the often negative perceptions of smooth jazz  stating   I challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative  Furthermore  I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz fusion era  Instead  I argue that smooth jazz is a long lived musical style that merits multi disciplinary analyses of its origins  critical dialogues  performance practice  and reception       Acid jazz  nu jazz  and jazz rap Main articles  Acid jazz  Nu jazz  and Jazz rap Acid jazz developed in the UK in the     s and     s  influenced by jazz funk and electronic dance music  Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition  sometimes including Sampling  music  or a live DJ cutting and scratching   but it is just as likely to be played live by musicians  who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance  Richard S  Ginell of AllMusic considers Roy Ayers  one of the prophets of acid jazz        Nu jazz is influenced by jazz harmony and melodies  and there are usually no improvisational aspects  It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept  It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz house  as exemplified by St Germain  Jazzanova  and Fila Brazillia  to more band based improvised jazz with electronic elements  for example  The Cinematic Orchestra  Kobol and the Norwegian  future jazz  style pioneered by Bugge Wesseltoft  Jaga Jazzist  and Nils Petter Molv r   Jazz rap developed in the late     s and early     s and incorporates jazz influences into hip hop  In       Gang Starr released the debut single  Words I Manifest   which sampled Dizzy Gillespie s       Night in Tunisia   and Stetsasonic released  Talkin  All That Jazz   which sampled Lonnie Liston Smith  Gang Starr s debut LP No More Mr  Nice Guy        and their      track  Jazz Thing  sampled Charlie Parker and Ramsey Lewis  The groups which made up the Native Tongues Posse tended toward jazzy releases  these include the Jungle Brothers  debut Straight Out the Jungle         and A Tribe Called Quest s People s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm        and The Low End Theory         Rap duo Pete Rock   CL Smooth incorporated jazz influences on their      debut Mecca and the Soul Brother  Rapper Guru s Jazzmatazz series began in      using jazz musicians during the studio recordings  Although jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success  Miles Davis  final album Doo Bop  released posthumously in       was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee  Davis  ex bandmate Herbie Hancock also absorbed hip hop influences in the mid     s  releasing the album Dis Is Da Drum in        Punk jazz and jazzcore  John Zorn performing in      The relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with post punk in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz  In London  the Pop Group began to mix free jazz and dub reggae into their brand of punk rock       In New York  No Wave took direct inspiration from both free jazz and punk  Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch s Queen of Siam       Gray  the work of James Chance and the Contortions  who mixed Soul with free jazz and punk       and the Lounge Lizards       the first group to call themselves  punk jazz    John Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock  and incorporated this into free jazz with the release of the Spy vs  Spy album in       a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes done in the contemporary thrashcore style       In the same year  Sonny Sharrock  Peter Br tzmann  Bill Laswell  and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit  a similarly aggressive blend of thrash and free jazz       These developments are the origins of jazzcore  the fusion of free jazz with hardcore punk   M Base Main article  M Base  Steve Coleman in Paris  July      The M Base movement started in the     s  when a loose collective of young African American musicians in New York which included Steve Coleman  Greg Osby  and Gary Thomas developed a complex but grooving      sound  In the     s  most M Base participants turned to more conventional music  but Coleman  the most active participant  continued developing his music in accordance with the M Base concept       Coleman s audience decreased  but his music and concepts influenced many musicians  according to pianist Vijay Iver and critic Ben Ratlifff of The New York Times            M Base changed from a movement of a loose collective of young musicians to a kind of informal Coleman  school        with a much advanced but already originally implied concept       Steve Coleman s music and M Base concept gained recognition as  next logical step  after Charlie Parker  John Coltrane  and Ornette Coleman            s present Since the     s  jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates  but rather a wide range of styles and genres are popular  Individual performers often play in a variety of styles  sometimes in the same performance  Pianist Brad Mehldau and The Bad Plus have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio  recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians  The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music  A firm avant garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players  such as saxophonists Greg Osby and Charles Gayle  while others  such as James Carter  have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework  Harry Connick Jr  began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz of his home  New Orleans  beginning with his first recording when he was    years old       Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist Ellis Marsalis       Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie When Harry Met Sally  which sold over two million copies       Crossover success has also been achieved by Diana Krall  Norah Jones  Cassandra Wilson  Kurt Elling  and Jamie Cullum  A number of players who usually perform in largely straight ahead settings have emerged since the     s  including pianists Jason Moran and Vijay Iyer  guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel  vibraphonist Stefon Harris  trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Terence Blanchard  saxophonists Chris Potter and Joshua Redman  clarinetist Ken Peplowski and bassist Christian McBride  Although jazz rock fusion reached the height of its popularity in the     s  the use of electronic instruments and rock derived musical elements in jazz continued in the     s and     s  Musicians using this approach include Pat Metheny  John Abercrombie  John Scofield and the Swedish group e s t  Since the beginning of the     s  electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre  Jazz elements such as improvisation  rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz  bebop  cool and modal jazz        Artists such as Squarepusher  Aphex Twin  Flying Lotus and sub genres like IDM  Drum n  Bass  Jungle and Techno ended up incorporating a lot of these elements        Squarepusher being cited as one big influence for jazz performers drummer Mark Guiliana and pianist Brad Mehldau  showing the correlations between jazz and electronic music are a two way street       In       Ken Burns s documentary Jazz was premiered on PBS  featuring Wynton Marsalis and other experts reviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time  It received some criticism  however  for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed  and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the   th century  The mid     s saw an increasing influence of R B  hip hop  and pop music on jazz  In       Kendrick Lamar released his third studio album  To Pimp a Butterfly  The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as Thundercat      and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling  In that same year  saxophonist Kamasi Washington released his nearly three hour long debut  The Epic  Its hip hop inspired beats and R B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant       but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet  Another internet aided trend of      s jazz was that of extreme reharmonization  inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as Art Tatum  as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans  Supergroup Snarky Puppy adopted this trend  allowing players like Cory Henry      to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing  YouTube phenomenon Jacob Collier also gained recognition for his ability to play an incredibly large number of instruments and his ability to use microtones  advanced polyrhythms  and blend a spectrum of genres in his largely homemade production process        See also   Jazz portal
