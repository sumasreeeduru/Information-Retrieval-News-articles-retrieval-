children of Loet Shinawatra and Yindi Ramingwong              Her father was a businessman and member of parliament for Chiang Mai      Her paternal family is of Hakka Chinese origin  descending from Seng Saekhu  her great grandfather  who immigrated from Meizhou  Guangdong  to Siam in the     s  becoming a tax farmer in Chiang Mai  On her maternal side  she is a descendant of the former royal family of Chiang Mai through her grandmother  Princess Chanthip na Chiangmai  great great granddaughter of Prince Thammalangka who ruled Chiang Mai in the early   th century   Yingluck grew up in Chiang Mai and attended Regina Coeli College  a private girls  school  for the lower secondary level  followed by Yupparaj College  a co educational school  at the upper secondary level      She graduated with a BA degree from the Faculty of Political Science and Public Administration  at Chiang Mai University in      and received a MPA degree  specialisation in Management Information Systems  from Kentucky State University in       Yingluck began her career as a sales and marketing intern in      at Shinawatra Directories Co   Ltd   a telephone directory business founded by AT T International  She later became the director of procurement and the director of operations  In       she became the general manager of Rainbow Media  a subsidiary of International Broadcasting Corporation  which later became TrueVisions   She left as Deputy CEO of IBC in       and became the CEO of Advanced Info Service  AIS   Thailand s largest mobile phone operator      After the sale of Shin Corporation  the parent company of AIS  to Temasek Holdings  Yingluck resigned from AIS  but remained Managing Director of SC Asset Co Ltd  the Shinawatra family property development company  She was investigated by Thailand s Securities and Exchange Commission regarding possible insider trading after she sold shares of her AIS stock for a profit prior to the sale of the Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings  However  no charges were filed      Yingluck Shinawatra is also a committee member and secretary of the Thaicom Foundation  Yingluck received      percent of Shin Corp shares out of the       percent that Thaksin Shinawatra and his then wife held in       The military junta appointed Assets Examination Committee charged that Yingluck made up false transactions and that  there were no real payments for each Ample Rich Co   Ltd shares sold  and  the transactions were made at a cost basis of par value in order to avoid income taxes  and all the dividends paid out by Shin to those people were transferred to  her sister in law  Potjaman s bank accounts   However  the AEC did not pursue a case against her      Yingluck  in response  claimed that  her family has been a victim of political persecution        Political career edit  Establishment of the Pheu Thai Party edit  After the governing People s Power party was dissolved and its executive board was banned from political activity for five years by the Constitutional Court on   December           the former People s Power Party MPs formed the Pheu Thai Party  Yingluck was asked to become the party s leader  but she declined  saying that she had no desire to be prime minister and wanted to concentrate on business      Yongyuth Wichaidit became the leader of the party  US diplomatic cables leaked in      revealed that during a   September      meeting  former Deputy Prime Minister and  close Thaksin ally  Sompong Amornvivat told Ambassador to Thailand Eric John that he did not envision a big role for Yingluck in the Pheu Thai Party  and that  Thaksin himself was not eager to raise her profile within the party  and was more focused on finding ways to keep his own hand active in politics   However  in a subsequent cable dated    November       the ambassador noted that in a meeting with Yingluck  she spoke with confidence about the  operations  strategy and goals  of the Pheu Thai party and seemed  far more poised  than in previous meetings  The cable cited Yingluck saying that   Someone could easily emerge relatively late in the game to take the reins of the party and serve as the next Prime Minister       Yingluck s bank account was among    accounts that the Abhisit government accused of being used to finance the Red Shirt protesters during their demonstrations in       Abhisit accused the Red Shirts of trying to overthrow the monarchy  something they denied  However  the government did not pursue any legal action against her  The Department for Special Investigation found that from    April      to May           million baht was deposited into one of her accounts while     million baht was withdrawn  On    April      alone      million baht was withdrawn       Pheu Thai Party leadership edit  Yongyuth had stated his intention of resigning as party leader in late       Speculation about a snap election in early      heightened internal debate over the party leadership  The front runners were Yingluck and Mingkwan Sangsuwan  who had led the opposition in an unsuccessful motion of no confidence against the Democrat Party led coalition government  As late as    January       Yingluck continued to rule out the party leadership  repeating that she wanted to focus on business  However  she was endorsed by veteran politician Chalerm Yubamrung      On    May       the Pheu Thai party voted to name Yingluck as their top candidate under the party list system  and presumably be the party s nominee for Prime Minister  for parliamentary election scheduled for   July  However  she was not made party leader and did not join the party s executive board  The ultimate decision was made by Thaksin himself   Some said she is my nominee  That s not true  But it can be said that Yingluck is my clone    Another important thing is that Ms Yingluck is my sister and she can make decisions for me  She can say  yes  or  no  on my behalf   noted Thaksin in an interview            election and rise to premiership edit  Main article       Thai general election Election campaign edit  Pheu Thai campaigned with a slogan of  Thaksin thinks  Pheu Thai acts       Yingluck s main campaign theme was reconciliation following the extended political crisis from      to       culminating in the military crackdown on protesters which left nearly     protesters dead and thousands injured  She promised to empower the Independent Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Thailand  ITRC   the panel that the Democrat led government had set up to investigate the killings      The ITRC had complained that its work was hampered by the military and the government      Yingluck also proposed a general amnesty for all major politically motivated incidents that had taken place since the      coup  which could include the coup itself  court rulings banning Thai Rak Thai and People s Power Party leaders from seeking office  the People s Alliance for Democracy  PAD  seizures of Government House and Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airports  the military crackdowns of      and       and the conviction of Thaksin Shinawatra for abuse of power      The proposal was fiercely attacked by the government  who claimed that it would specifically give amnesty to Thaksin  and also result in the return to him of the    billion baht of his wealth that the government had seized as a penalty  However  Yingluck denied that the return of seized assets was a priority for the Pheu Thai party  and repeated that she had no intention of giving amnesty to any one person  Abhisit claimed outright that Yingluck was lying and that amnesty to Thaksin actually was the Pheu Thai party s policy      citation needed  The government blamed Pheu Thai for the bloodshed during the military crackdown      Yingluck described a      vision for the elimination of poverty      She promised to reduce the corporate income tax from    per cent to    per cent and then    per cent by      and to raise the minimum wage to     baht per day and the minimum wage for university graduates to        baht per month  Her agricultural policies included improving operating cashflow to farmers and providing loans of up to    per cent of expected income  based on a guaranteed rice price of        baht per tonne      She also planned to provide free public Wi Fi and a tablet PC to every schoolchild  a Thai Rak Thai Party plan to provide one laptop per child was cancelled after the      military coup       citation needed   Election results and the establishment of the government edit  Exit polls indicated a landslide victory  with Pheu Thai projected to win as many as     seats in the     seat parliament      However  the official result was     seats and    percent of the vote for Pheu Thai  with a       percent election turnout rate      There were   million invalid ballots  the large number was cited as the cause for the difference between the exit poll results and the official count      It was only the  nd time in Thai history that a single party won more than half of the seats in parliament  the first time was in      with Thaksin s own Thai Rak Thai Party  United Nations secretary general Ban Ki moon welcomed the outcome of the elections and called for all parties to  respect the will of the Thai people as expressed through the democratic process   Aung San Su Kyi congratulated Yingluck  praised the election as  free and fair   and said that she expected  the ties between Myanmar and Thailand to get better           Yingluck quickly formed a coalition with the Chartthaipattana     seats   Chart Pattana Puea Pandin    seats   and Phalang Chon    seats   and Mahachon    seat   and New Democracy    seat  parties  giving her a total of     seats          Outgoing Defense Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan said that he accepted the election results  and after having talked with military leaders  would not intervene

cabinet include former Interior Permanent Secretary Yongyuth Wichaidit as Interior Minister  Securities and Exchange Commission Secretary General Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala as Finance Minister  and

Yingluck with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the APEC summit in Vladivostok  Russia    September      Polls from shortly after her cabinet was announced found that the cabinet rated most highly in terms of economic competency  It also showed that Yingluck was much more popular than her exiled brother Thaksin            floods edit  Main article       Thailand floods The      rainy season saw the highest levels of rainfall in Thailand in the previous    years      Flooding started in northern Thailand on    July  a week prior to Yingluck s appointment as Prime Minister      Flooding quickly spread from the North to the Central Chao Phraya River Basin  and by the beginning of October  the province of Ayutthaya  north of Bangkok  was almost flooded  The floods were the worst in Thailand in over    years  Yingluck established centralised flood monitoring and relief operations in mid August and made tours of flooded provinces beginning    August      Yingluck also pledged to invest in long term flood prevention projects  including the construction of drainage canals  Flood reduction measures were hampered by disputes between people on the different sides of flood barriers  those on the flooded side in some instances sabotaged the barriers  sometimes resulting in armed confrontation          Opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva and military leaders called for Yingluck to declare a state of emergency  claiming that it would give the military greater authority to deal with embankment sabotage      A state of emergency had last been declared in      during the Abhisit

and dismissing nine members of the government      The regrouping was assessed as a step to increase loyalty to the head of government and a reaction to discontent with the government s management of the flood disaster          Especially noted was the choice of Nalinee Taveesin  Minister in the PM s Office   who is on a US blacklist for alleged business links to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
