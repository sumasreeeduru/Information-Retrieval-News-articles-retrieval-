 or may lead  to an unstable and dangerous situation affecting an individual  group  or all of society  Crises are negative changes in the human or environmental affairs  especially when they occur abruptly  with little or no warning  More loosely  a crisis is a testing time or an emergency    The alien invasion in War of the Worlds is a fictitious crisis Contents    Etymology   Definition

which in turn was borrowed from the Greek        krisis  discrimination  decision  crisis      The noun is derived from the verb       krin   which means  distinguish  choose  decide      In English  crisis was first used in a medical context  for the time in the development of a disease when a change indicates either recovery or death  that is  a turning point  It was also used for a major change in the development of a disease     By the mid seventeenth century  it took on the figurative meaning of a  vitally important or decisive stage in the progress of anything   especially a period of uncertainty or difficulty     without necessarily having the implication of a decision point   Definition edit  Crisis is often linked to the concept of psychological stress and used to suggest a frightening or fraught experience  In general  crisis is the situation of a  complex system   family  economy  society  Note that simple systems do not enter crises  We can speak about a crisis of moral values  an economical or political crisis  but not a motor crisis  when the system functions poorly  the system still functions  but does not break down   an immediate decision is necessary to stop the further disintegration of the system  but the causes of the dysfunction are not immediately identified  the causes are so many  or unknown  that it is impossible to take a rational  informed decision to reverse the situation      Crisis has several defining characteristics  Seeger  Sellnow  and Ulmer    say that crises have four defining characteristics that are  specific  unexpected  and non routine events or series of events that  create  high levels of uncertainty and threat or perceived threat to an organization s high priority goals   Thus the first three characteristics are that the event is      unexpected  i e   a surprise     creates uncertainty    is seen as a threat to important goals Venette    argues that  crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained   Therefore the fourth defining quality is the need for change  If change is not needed  the event could more accurately be described as a failure  Apart from natural crises that are inherently unpredictable  volcanic eruptions  tsunami etc   most of the crises that we face are created by man  Hence the requirements of their being  unexpected  depends upon man failing to note the onset of crisis conditions  Some of our inability to recognise crises before they become dangerous is due to denial and other psychological responses     that provide succour and protection for our emotions  A different set of reasons for failing to notice the onset of crises is that we allow ourselves to be  tricked  into believing that we are doing something for reasons that are false  In other words  we are doing the wrong things for the right reasons  For example  we might believe that we are solving the threats of climate change by engaging in economic trading activity that has no real impact on the climate  Mitroff and Silvers     posit two reasons for these mistakes  which they classify as Type    inadvertent  and Type    deliberate  errors  The effect of our inability to attend to the likely results of our actions can result in crisis  From this perspective we might usefully learn that failing to understand the real causes of our difficulties is likely to lead to repeated downstream  blowback   Where states are concerned  Michael Brecher  based on case studies of the International Crisis Behavior  ICB  project  suggested a different way of defining crisis as conditions are perceptions held by the highest level decision makers of the actor concerned        threat to basic values  with a simultaneous or subsequent    high probability of involvement in military hostilities  and the awareness of    finite time for response to the external value threat   Chinese word for  crisis  edit  Main article  Chinese word for  crisis  It is frequently said in Western motivational speaking that the Chinese word for  crisis  is composed of two Chinese characters signifying  danger  and  opportunity  respectively  This is  however  considered by linguists to be a misperception      Political crisis edit  See also  Constitutional crisis See also  Category Government crises  Economic edit  Main articles  Economic crisis and Financial crisis An economic crisis is a sharp transition to a recession  See for example      economic crisis in Mexico  Argentine economic crisis              South American economic crisis of       Economic crisis of Cameroon  Crisis theory is a central achievement in the conclusions of Karl Marx s critique of Capital  A financial crisis may be a banking crisis or currency crisis   Environmental edit  Crises pertaining to the environment include   Environmental disaster edit  Main article  Environmental disaster An environmental disaster is a disaster that is due to human activity and should not be confused with natural disasters  see below   In this case  the impact of humans  alteration of the ecosystem has led to widespread and or long lasting consequences  It can include the deaths of animals  including humans  and plant systems  or severe disruption of human life  possibly requiring migration   Natural disaster edit  Main article  Natural disaster A natural disaster is the consequence of a natural hazard  e g  volcanic eruption  earthquake  landslide  which moves from potential into an active phase  and as a result affects human activities   Human vulnerability  exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate emergency management  leads to financial  structural  and human losses   The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster  their resilience      This understanding is concentrated in the formulation   disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability       A natural hazard will hence never result in a natural disaster in areas without vulnerability  e g  strong earthquakes in uninhabited areas  For lists of natural disasters  see the list of disasters or the list of deadliest natural disasters   Endangered species edit  Main article  Endangered species An endangered species is a population of an organism which is at risk of becoming extinct because it is either few in number  or threatened by changing environmental or predation parameters   An endangered species is usually a taxonomic species  but may be another evolutionary significant unit  The World Conservation Union  IUCN  has classified    percent of the        species assessed by      as threatened       International edit  Main articles  International crisis and Crisis management For information about crises in the field of study in international relations  see crisis management and international crisis  In this context  a crisis can be loosely defined as a situation where there is a perception of threat  heightened anxiety  expectation of possible violence and the belief that any actions will have far reaching consequences  Lebow          Personal edit  This section contains instructions  advice  or how to content  The

 Messengers going to Job  each with bad news       woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld A personal crisis occurs when an individual can no longer cope with a situation      This is preceded by events of an extraordinary nature triggering extreme tension and stress within an individual  i e   the crisis  which then requires major decisions or actions to resolve  Crises can be triggered by a wide range of situations including  but not limited to  extreme weather conditions  sudden change in employment financial state  medical emergencies  long term illness  and social or familial turmoil  Crises are simply a change in the events that comprise the day to day life of a person and those in their close circle  such as the loss of a job  extreme financial hardship  substance addiction abuse and other situations that are life altering and require action that is outside the  normal  daily routine  A person going through a crisis experiences a state of mental disequilibrium  in which the ego struggles to balance both internal and external demands      In this case  said person resorts to coping mechanisms to deal with the stress  Various coping mechanisms include       High emotions  crying  physical withdrawal  Defence mechanisms  denial  repression  Making rash decisions Acting out Putting things on hold In some cases  it is difficult for an individual undergoing a crisis to adapt to the situation  As it is outside of their normal range of functioning  it is common that one endures a struggle to control emotions  This lack of control can lead to suicidal tendencies  substance abuse  trouble with the law and general avoidance of resources available for help  One such resource used to aid an individual in crisis is their social support system  which can come in the form of family  friends  coworkers  or health professionals  It is important that a support system consists of people that the individual trusts  Although these support systems play a crucial role in aiding an individual through a crisis  they are also the underlying cause of two thirds of mental health crises      The aforementioned mental health crises can include marital issues  abandonment  parental conflict and family struggles  In order to aid someone in a crisis  it is crucial to be able to identify the signs that indicate they are undergoing an internal conflict  These signs  as well as the aforementioned coping mechanisms  include           Irrational and or narrow thinking Lowered attention span Unclear motives Disorganized approach to problem solving Resistance to communication Inability to differ between large and small issues Change alteration to social networks Ways to manage a crisis edit  As aforementioned  a crisis to this day can be overcome by implementing mechanisms such as  sleep  rejection  physical exercise  meditation and thinking  To assist individuals in regaining emotional equilibrium  intervention can be used  The overall goal of a crisis intervention is to get the individual back to a pre crisis level of functioning or higher with the help of a social support group  As said by Judith Swan  there s a strong correlation between the client s emotional balance and the trust in their support system in helping them throughout their crisis      The steps of crisis intervention are  to assess the situation based on behaviour patterns of the individual  decide what type of help is needed  make a plan of action  and finally to take action intervention  based on the individual s skills to regain equilibrium      The Registered Nurses  Association of Ontario proposed the ABC model for dealing with client s interventions in crises       Basic attending skills  making the person comfortable  remaining calm  etc  Identifying the problem and therapeutic interaction  explore their perceptions  identify sources of emotional distress  identify impairments in behavioural functioning  use therapeutic interactions Coping  identify coping attempts  present alternative coping strategies  follow up post crisis  Benefits of listening in a crisis edit  Moreover  another method for helping individuals who are suffering in a crisis is active listening  it is defined as seeing circumstances from another perspective and letting the other person know that the negotiator  the helper  understands their perspective  Through this  they establish trust and rapport by demonstrating empathy  understanding and objectivity in a non judgmental way  It is important for the negotiator to listen to verbal and non verbal reactions of the person in need  in order to be able to label the emotion that the individual is showing  Thus  this demonstrates that the helper is tuned in emotionally  Furthermore  there are other techniques that can be used to demonstrate actively listening such as  paraphrasing  silence and reflecting or mirroring  The goal in active listening is to keep the person talking about their situation       In chaos theory edit  Main article  Crisis  dynamical systems  When the control parameter of a chaotic system is modified  the chaotic attractor touches an unstable periodic orbit inside the basin of attraction inducing a sudden expansion in the attractor  This phenomenon is termed as interior crisis in a chaotic system   See also edit     Chinese word for  crisis  Constitutional crisis Coup d  tat Crisis state Crisis
