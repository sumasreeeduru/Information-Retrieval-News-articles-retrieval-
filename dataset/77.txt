Muslim Brotherhood in the army  though el Sisi has always declared that the Egyptian Army stands on the side of the Egyptian people  On    April       during celebrations for Sinai Liberation Day  el Sisi said that  the hand that harms any Egyptian must be cut       This statement was taken by Morsi opponents as a clarification that the Army is in support of them  However  the statement was

was not resolved by then        Millions of Egyptians are demanding the overthrow of Morsi    July      On   July       the Egyptian Armed Forces declared that as the political parties had failed to meet the deadline and Morsi had failed to build a national consensus for his leadership  the army had to overthrow Morsi in a coup d  tat  The army then installed Adly Mansour as the interim head of state in his place until a new president could be elected  and ordered the arrest of many members of the Muslim Brotherhood on charges of  inciting violence and disturbing general security and peace

acceptance from anti Morsi demonstrations and condemnation from pro Morsi supporters in Rabaa al Adawiya  On    July       during a speech at a military parade  el Sisi called for mass demonstrations to grant the Egyptian military and police a  mandate  to crack down on terrorism      While supporters interpreted this to mean that el Sisi felt the need of the people to prove to the world that it was not a coup but the popular will  the statement was seen by opponents as contradicting the military s pledges to hand over power to civilians after removing Morsi and as indicating an imminent crackdown against Islamists          The reactions to el Sisi s announcement ranged from open support from the Egyptian presidency     and the Tamarod movement     to rejection  not only by the Muslim Brotherhood      but also by the Salafi Nour Party      the Islamist Strong Egypt Party      the liberal April   Youth Movement     and some Egyptian human rights groups      During the August

Robert Fisk described then General el Sisi as being at a loss  but that a massacre   as Fisk called the sit in dispersal   would go down in history as an infamy      Writing for the American magazine Time  Lee Smith concluded that  Egypt s new leader is unfit to rule   referring not to the actual head of government at the time  interim president Adly Mansour  but to Sisi      In a file published by the State Information Services  the government explained the raids by stating that  police went on to use force dispersing the sit in on    August      with the least possible damage  causing hundreds of civilians and police to fall as victims  while Muslim Brotherhood supporters imposed a blockade for    days against the people in al Nahda and Rabaa al Adawiya squares under the name of

an introduction to cut the subsidies on basic food stuffs and energy  which eat up nearly a quarter of the state budget  The Egyptian government has always provided these subsidies as a crucial aid to millions of people who live in poverty  fearing people s anger in five years time       Egypt has spent     billion on energy subsidies in a decade which made petrol in Egypt among the world s cheapest       Cutting the energy subsidies will save    billion pounds  The government hopes the decision will benefit services such as health and education  Sisi also raised taxes on alcohol and cigarettes  applying a flat tax on local and imported cigarettes to between    and    cents per pack  as well as new property taxes  and plans to introduce a new scheme for value added taxes       Chicken prices would reportedly rise by    percent days after the decision because of added transportation costs  Mini bus and taxi fares were raised by about    percent       Slashing subsidies was recommended by international financial institutions  but no Egyptian leader had managed to broach the issue  fearing unrest in a country where nearly    percent of the population live in poverty and rely on government aid  President Sisi defended the decision to raise fuel prices  saying it was  bitter medicine  that should have been taken before and was     years late  but was not taken  as governments feared a backlash like the Bread Riots of            Sisi  who had previously accepted only half of his own pay  called on Egyptians to make sacrifices  vowing to repair an economy growing at the slowest pace in two decades  Sisi warned Egyptians of more pain over the next two years from economic problems that he said had accumulated over the last four decades and needed to be fixed

against former president Mohamed Morsi      continued to grow in Sisi s first months in office  challenging the new government  Due to shortage in energy production  growing consumption  terrorist attacks on Egypt s energy infrastructure  debts to foreign oil companies and the absence of the needed periodic maintenance of the power plants  the energy blackout rates in Egypt rose to unprecedented levels  with some parts of the country facing around six power cuts a day for up to two hours each       In August       daily electricity consumption hit a record high of      gigawatts      more power than stations could provide  The next month Egypt suffered a massive power outage that halted parts of the Cairo Metro  took television stations off the air  and ground much of the country to a halt for several hours because of the sudden loss of    percent of the country s power generation       Sisi  on his part  said that the idler would be held accountable and promised to partially solve the economic crisis by August       and that  beginning with December that year  the crisis will be dealt with entirely  Both long term and short term plans were introduced  In the short term  Egypt signed a contract with General Electric  GE  to provide the country with     gigawatts by the summer of       The first phase entered service in June and the final phase was expected

years  Egypt achieved a surplus in power generating capacity estimated at     gigawatts  In the long term  Egypt paid more than    billion it owed to foreign oil companies between January and March

boost the country s electricity generation by    percent       in addition to an energy deal worth     billion  LE     billion  with BP to provide the country with an extra quarter of local energy production       Sisi also stated that Egypt is not just solving its energy crisis  but rather seeking to become a  global hub for energy trading        In Nicosia on    November      he met  President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades and the Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras                 They encouraged and welcomed private sector initiatives of energy infrastructure projects
