offered on Sky Cable  Back then the channel served the viewers through two major news programs  Dateline Philippines and Primetime News  while short news advisories aired throughout the day  To enhance its resources and strengthen its position as the primary news channel for the Filipinos  SNN in      merged with Sky News  another Lopez owned cable news channel that specialized in business
