  viewtalkedit  The Spring and Autumn period was a period in Chinese history from approximately     to     BCE  or according to some authorities until     BCE a      which corresponds roughly to the first half of the Eastern Zhou period   The period s name derives from the Spring and Autumn Annals  a chronicle of the state of Lu between     and     BCE  which tradition associates with Confucius          BCE   During this period  the Zhou royal authority over the various feudal states eroded as more and more dukes and marquesses obtained de facto regional autonomy  defying the king s court in Luoyi and waging wars amongst themselves  The gradual Partition of Jin  one of the most powerful states  marked the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period

Quanrong invasion destroyed the Western Zhou and its capital Haojing  forcing the Zhou king to flee to the eastern capital Luoyi  Chinese       The event ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty  which is divided into the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States periods   During the Spring and Autumn period  China s feudal system of fengjian      became largely irrelevant  The Zhou court  having lost its homeland in the Guanzhong region  held nominal power  but had real control over only a small royal demesne centered on Luoyi  During the early part of the Zhou dynasty period  royal relatives and generals had been given control over fiefdoms in an effort to maintain Zhou authority over vast territory      As the power of the Zhou kings waned  these fiefdoms became increasingly independent states  The most important states  known later as the twelve vassals  came together in regular conferences where they decided important matters  such as military expeditions against foreign groups or against offending nobles  During these conferences one vassal ruler was sometimes declared hegemon  Chinese     pinyin  b   later  Chinese     pinyin  b    As the era continued  larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed suzerainty over smaller ones  By the  th century BCE most small states had disappeared and just a few large and powerful principalities dominated China  Some southern states  such as Chu and Wu  claimed independence from the Zhou  who undertook wars against some of them  Wu and Yue   Amid the interstate power struggles  internal conflict was also rife  six  lite landholding families waged war on each other inside Jin  political enemies set about eliminating the Chen family in Qi  and the legitimacy of the rulers was often challenged in civil wars by various royal family members in Qin and Chu  Once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions  the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the Warring States period  which began in     BCE when the three remaining  lite families in Jin Zhao  Wei and Han partitioned the state   Early Spring and Autumn          BCE  edit  Court moves east      BCE  edit  After the Zhou capital was sacked by the Marquess of Shen and the Quanrong barbarians  the Zhou moved the capital east from the now desolated Zongzhou in Haojing near modern Xi an to Wangcheng in the Yellow River Valley   The Zhou royalty was then closer to its main supporters     particularly Jin  and Zheng        the Zhou royal family had much weaker authority and relied on lords from these vassal states for protection  especially during their flight to the eastern capital   In Chengzhou  Prince Yijiu was crowned by his supporters as King Ping      However  with the Zhou domain greatly reduced to Chengzhou and nearby areas  the court could no longer support the six army groups it had in the past  Zhou kings had to request help from powerful vassal states for protection from raids and for resolution of internal power struggles   The Zhou court would never regain its original authority  instead  it was relegated to being merely a figurehead of the feudal states  Though the king de jure retained the Mandate of Heaven  the title held little actual power  With the decline of Zhou power  the Yellow River drainage basin was divided into hundreds of small  autonomous states  most of them consisting of a single city  though a handful of multi city states  particularly those on the periphery  had power and opportunity to expand outward      A total of     states are mentioned in the chronicles for this period      of which were absorbed by the four largest states by the end of the period     Shortly after the royal family s move to Chengzhou  a hierarchical alliance system arose where the Zhou king would give the title of hegemon to the leader of the state with the most powerful military  the hegemon was obligated to protect both the weaker Zhou states and the Zhou royalty from the intruding non Zhou peoples         the Northern Di  the Southern Man  the Eastern Yi  and the Western Rong   This political framework retained the f ngji n power structure  though interstate and intrastate conflict often led to disregard for feudal customs  respect for the Ji family  and solidarity with other Zhou peoples       The king s prestige legitimized the military leaders of the states  and helped mobilize collective defense of Zhou territory against  barbarians       Over the next two centuries  the four most powerful states Qin  Jin  Qi and Chu struggled for power   These multi city states often used the pretext of aid and protection to intervene and gain suzerainty over the smaller states   During this rapid expansion      interstate relations alternated between low level warfare and complex diplomacy       Zheng falls out with the court          BCE  edit  Duke Yin of Lu ascended the throne in     BCE      From this year on the state of Lu kept an official chronicle  the Spring and Autumn Annals  which along with its commentaries is the standard source for the Spring and Autumn period  Corresponding chronicles are known to have existed in other states as well  but all but the Lu chronicle have been lost  In     BCE  Duke Zhuang of Zheng went to the capital for an audience with King Huan  During the encounter the duke felt he was not treated with the respect and etiquette which would have been appropriate  given that Zheng was now the chief protector of the capital      In     BCE Zheng also became involved in a border dispute with Lu regarding the Fields of Xu  The fields had been put in the care of Lu by the king for the exclusive purpose of producing royal sacrifices for the sacred Mount Tai      For Zheng to regard the fields as just any other piece of land was an insult to the court  By     BCE  relations had soured enough that the king launched a punitive expedition against Zheng  The duke counterattacked and raided Zhou territory  defeating the royal forces in the Battle of Xuge and injuring the king himself             Zheng was the first vassal to openly defy the king  kicking off the centuries of warfare without respect for titles which would characterize the period  The display of Zheng s martial strength was effective until succession problems after Zhuang s death in     weakened the state     In     BCE  there was a failed assassination attempt against King Zhuang  orchestrated by elements at court       The Five Hegemons          BCE  edit  Main article  Five Hegemons  Map of the Five Hegemons during the Spring and Autumn period of Zhou Dynasty Hegemony of Qi          BCE  edit  Main article  Duke Huan of Qi The first hegemon was Duke Huan of Qi  r          BCE    With the help of his prime minister  Guan Zhong  Duke Huan reformed Qi to centralize its power structure   The state consisted of     townships  with the duke and two senior ministers each in charge of five  military functions were also united with civil ones   These and related reforms provided the state  already powerful from control of trade crossroads  with a greater ability to mobilize resources than the more loosely organized states      By     BCE  Qi had clearly shown its economic and military predominance  and Duke Huan assembled the leaders of Lu  Song  Chen  and Zheng  who elected him as their leader   Soon after  King Hui of Zhou conferred the title of b   hegemon   giving Duke Huan royal authority in military ventures           An important basis for justifying Qi s dominance over the other states was presented in the slogan  supporting the king  and expelling the barbarians        zun wang rang yi   the role of subsequent hegemons would also be framed in this way  as the primary defender and supporter of nominal Zhou authority and the existing order  Using this authority  Duke Huan intervened in a power struggle in Lu  protected Yan from encroaching Western Rong nomads      BCE   drove off Northern Di nomads after they d invaded Wey      BCE  and Xing      BCE   providing the people with provisions and protective garrison units  and led an alliance of eight states to conquer Cai and thereby block the northward expansion of Chu      BCE       At his death in     BCE  five of Duke Huan s sons contended for the throne  badly weakening the state so that it was no longer regarded as the hegemon  For nearly ten years  no ruler held the title        Urbanization during the Spring and Autumn period  Hegemony of Song          BCE  edit  Main article  Duke Xiang of Song Duke Xiang of Song attempted to claim the hegemony in the wake of Qi s decline  perhaps driven by a desire to restore the Shang Dynasty from which Song had descended  He hosted peace conferences in the same style as Qi had done  and conducted aggressive military campaigns against his rivals  Duke Xiang however met his end when  against the advice of his staff  he attacked the much larger state of Chu  The Song forces were defeated at the battle of Hong in     BCE  and the duke himself died in the following year from an injury sustained in the battle  After Xiang s death his successors adopted a more modest foreign policy  better suited to the country s small size      As Duke Xiang was never officially recognized as hegemon by the King of Zhou  not all sources list him as one of the Five Hegemons   Hegemony of Jin          BCE  edit  Main article  Duke Wen of Jin When Duke Wen of Jin came to power in     BCE  he capitalized on the reforms of his father  Duke Xian  r          BCE   who had centralized the state  killed off relatives who might threaten his authority  conquered sixteen smaller states  and even absorbed some Rong and Di peoples to make Jin much more powerful than it had been previously       When he assisted King Xiang in a succession struggle in     BCE  Xiang awarded Jin with strategically valuable territory near Chengzhou  Duke Wen of Jin then used his growing power to coordinate a military response with Qi  Qin  and Song against Chu  which had begun encroaching northward after the death of Duke Hu n of Qi   With a decisive Chu loss at the Battle of Chengpu      BCE   Duke Wen s loyalty to the Zhou king was rewarded at an interstate conference when King X ang awarded him the title of b       After the death of Duke Wen in     BCE  a growing tension manifested in interstate violence that turned smaller states  particularly those at the border between Jin and Chu  into sites of constant warfare  Qi and Qin also engaged in numerous interstate skirmishes with Jin or its allies to boost their own power       Hegemony of Qin          BCE  edit  Main article  Duke Mu of Qin Duke Mu of Qin had ascended the throne in     BCE and forged an alliance with Jin by marrying his daughter to Duke Wen  In     BCE  he established hegemony over the western Rong barbarians and became the most powerful lord of the time  However he did not chair any alliance with other states nor was he officially recognized as hegemon by the king  Therefore  not all sources accept him as one of the Five Hegemons   Hegemony of Chu          BCE  edit  Main article  King Zhuang of Chu King Zhuang of Chu expanded the borders of Chu well north of the Yangtze River  threatening the Central States in modern Henan  At one point the Chu forces advanced to just outside the royal capital of Zhou  upon which King Zhuang sent a messenger to ask how heavy and bulky the Nine Cauldrons were  implying he might soon arrange to have them moved to his own capital  In the end the Zhou capital was spared  and Chu shifted focus to harassing the nearby state of Zheng  The once hegemon state of Jin intervened to rescue Zheng from the Chu invaders but were resolutely defeated  which marks the ascension of Chu as the dominant state of the time      Despite his de facto hegemony  King Zhuang s self proclaimed title of  king  was never recognized by the Zhou states  In the Spring and Autumn Annals he is defiantly referred to by the Chu ruler s original title  viscount   the second lowest noble rank   even at a time when he dominated most of south China  Later historians however always include him as one of the Five Hegemons   Late Spring and Autumn          BCE  edit  The Six Ministers      BCE  edit  In addition to interstate conflict  internal conflicts between state leaders and local aristocrats also occurred   Eventually the dukes of Lu  Jin  Zheng  Wey and Qi would all become figureheads to powerful aristocratic families      In the case of Jin  the shift happened in     BCE when the army was split into six independent divisions  each dominated by a separate noble family  the Zhao  Wei  Han  Fan  Zhi and Zhongxing  The heads of the six families were conferred the titles of viscounts and made ministers      each heading one of the six departments of Zhou Dynasty government      From this point on  historians refer to  The Six Ministers  as the true power brokers of Jin  The same happened to Lu in     BCE  when the Three Huan divided the army into three parts and established their own separate spheres of influence  The heads of the three families were always among the department heads of Lu   Rise of Wu      BCE  edit  Wu was a  barbarian  state in modern Jiangsu  where the inhabitants sported short hair and tattoos  Although legend ascribed a Chinese origin to the ruling dynasty  Wu did not participate in the politics and wars of China until the last third of the Spring and Autumn period  Their first documented interaction with the Spring and Autumn states was in     BCE  when a Wu force attacked the small border state of Tan  causing some alarm in the various Chinese courts  Jin was quick to dispatch an ambassador to the court of the Wu king  Shoumeng  Jin promised to supply Wu with modern military technology and training in exchange for an alliance against Chu  a neighbour of Wu and Jin s nemesis in the struggle for hegemony  King Shoumeng accepted the offer  and Wu would continue to harass Chu for years to come       Attempts at peace      BCE  edit   Chinese pu vessel with interlaced dragon design  Spring and Autumn period  After a period of increasingly exhausting warfare  Qi  Qin  Jin and Chu met at a disarmament conference in     BCE and agreed to declare a truce to limit their military strength       This peace didn t last very long and it soon became apparent that the b  role had become outdated  the four major states had each acquired their own spheres of control and the notion of protecting Zhou territory had become less cogent as the control over  and the resulting cultural assimilation of  non Zhou peoples  as well as Chu s control of some Zhou areas  further blurred an already vague distinction between Zhou and non Zhou      In addition  new aristocratic houses were founded with loyalties to powerful states  rather than directly to the Zhou kings  though this process slowed down by the end of the seventh century BCE  possibly because territory available for expansion had been largely exhausted      The Zhou kings had also lost much of their prestige     so that  when Duke Dao of Jin  r          BCE  was recognized as b   it carried much less meaning than it had before   Hegemony of Wu          BCE  edit  Main article  King Hel  of Wu In     BCE King Hel  ascended the throne of Wu  With the help of Wu Zixu and Sun Zi  the author of The Art of War  he launched major offensives against the state of Chu  They prevailed in five battles  one of which was the Battle of Boju  and conquered the capital Ying  However  Chu managed to ask the state of Qin for help  and after being defeated by Qin  the vanguard general of Wu troops  Fugai  a younger brother of Hel   led a rebellion  After beating Fugai  Hel  was forced to leave Chu  Fugai later retired to Chu and settled there  King Hel  died during an invasion of Yue in     BCE  Some sources list him as one of the Five Hegemons  He was succeeded by his son King Fuchai of Wu  who nearly destroyed the Yue state  imprisoning King Goujian of Yue  Subsequently  Fuchai defeated Qi and extended Wu influence into central China  In     BCE  the philosopher Confucius was made acting prime minister of Lu  He is traditionally  if improbably  considered the author or editor of the Spring and Autumn annals  from which much of the information for this period is drawn  After only two years he was forced to resign and spent many years wandering between different states before returning to Lu  After returning to Lu he did not resume a political career  preferring to teach  Tradition holds that it was in this time he edited or wrote the Five Classics  including the Spring and Autumn   Hegemony of Yue          BCE  edit  Main article  King Goujian of Yue In     BCE  King Fuchai of Wu held an interstate conference to solidify his power base  but Yue captured the Wu capital  Fuchai rushed back but was besieged and died when the city fell in     BCE  Yue then concentrated on weaker neighbouring states  rather than the great powers to the north      With help from Wu s enemy Chu  Yue was able to be victorious after several decades of conflict  King Goujian destroyed and annexed Wu in     BCE  after which he was recognized as hegemon  The Zuo Commentary  Guoyu and Shiji provide almost no information about Goujian s subsequent reign or policies  What little is said is told from the perspective of other states  such as Duke Ai of Lu trying to enlist Yue s help in a coup against the Three Huan  Sima Qian notes that Goujian reigned on until his death  and that afterwards his descendants for whom no biographical information is given continued to rule for six generations before the state was finally absorbed into Chu during the Warring States period   Partition of Jin edit  Main article  Partition of Jin After the great age of Jin power  the Jin dukes began to lose authority over their nobles   A full scale civil war between     and     BCE ended with the elimination of most noble lines  the remaining aristocratic families divided Jin into three successor states  Han  Wei  and Zhao      This is the last event recorded in the Zuo Commentary  With the absorption of most of the smaller states in the era  this partitioning left seven major states in the Zhou world  the three fragments of Jin  the three remaining great powers of Qin  Chu and Qi  and the weaker state of Yan near modern Beijing  The partition of Jin  along with the Usurpation of Qi by Tian  marks the beginning of the Warring States period   List of states edit  This list is incomplete  you can help by adding missing items with

during the Spring and Autumn period Ancient sources such as the Zuo Zhuan and the eponymous Chunqiu record the various diplomatic activities  such as court visits paid by one ruler to another  Chinese      pinyin  ch o   meetings of officials or nobles of different states  simplified Chinese     traditional Chinese     pinyin  hu    missions of friendly inquiries sent by the ruler of one state to another  Chinese     pinyin  p n   emissaries sent from one state to another  Chinese     pinyin  sh    and hunting parties attended by representatives of different states  Chinese     pinyin  shou   Because of Chu s non Zhou origin  the state was considered semi barbarian and its rulers beginning with King Wu in     BCE proclaimed themselves kings in their own right  Chu intrusion into Zhou territory was checked several times by the other states  particularly in the major battles of Chengpu      BCE   Bi      BCE  and Yanling      BCE   which restored the states of Chen and Cai   Nobility edit  Main article  Fengjian King Wu abolished the Shang dynasty title  emperor   di   making the king the highest office of the Zhou dynasty  Below the king were five ranks of vassals  which from top to bottom rank were   duke   g ng      marquis or marquess   h u      count or earl   b       viscount   z       baron   n n      The ranks had been assigned by King Wu upon the foundation of the dynasty and were usually not revised to reflect changing levels of military strength  In the Spring and Autumn Period this led to contradictory situations such as the relatively insignificant state of Song being a duchy while a great power like Chu was only a viscounty   Literature edit  Some version of the Five Classics existed in Spring and Autumn period  as characters in the Zuo Commentary and Analects frequently quote the Book of Poetry and Book of Documents  On the other hand  the Zuo Commentary depicts some characters actually composing poems that would later be included in the received text of the Book of Poetry  In the Analects there are frequent references to  The Rites       but as Classical Chinese does not distinguish book titles from regular nouns it is not possible to know if what is meant is the Etiquette and Ceremonial  known then as the Book of Rites  or just the concept of ritual in general  The existence of the Book of Changes on the other hand is well attested in the Zuo Commentary  as multiple characters use it for divination and correctly quote the received text  Sima Qian claims that it was Confucius who  towards the close of the Spring and Autumn period  edited the received versions of the Book of Poetry  Book of Documents and Book of Rites  wrote the  Ten Wings  commentary on the Book of Changes and wrote the entirety of the Spring and Autumn Annals      This was long the predominant opinion in China  but modern scholarship considers it unlikely that all five classics could be the product of one man  While many philosophers such as Lao Zi and Sun Zi were active in the Spring and Autumn period  their ideas were probably not put into writing until the following Warring States period   Religion edit  While sources such as the Book of Poetry contain passing references to  The Emperor Above   Shang Di   there is no proper mythology around supernatural entities preserved in the Confucian Classics  The mythology is instead focused around the founders of the dynasty  kings Wen and Wu  who were worshipped as gods  The various states also worshipped their respective founders as local patron deities  As such the rulers of Qi worshipped Yu the Great and Song worshipped Tang long after the Xia and Shang dynasties had ceased to exist on a national level   Notes edit       The Partition of Jin  the watershed between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods took several decades  thus there is some debate between scholars as to the exact date       BCE      BCE  and     BCE are other common dates selected by historians       References edit  Citations edit      Kiser   Cai          Hsu       p          Chinn       p         Hsu               a b Higham               a b Shaughnessy               Lewis
