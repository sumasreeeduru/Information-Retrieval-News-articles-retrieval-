       New World Information and Communication Order  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search The New World Information and Communication Order  NWICO or NWIO  is a term coined in a debate over media representations of the developing world in UNESCO in the late     s early     s  The NWICO movement was part of a broader effort to formally tackle global economic inequality that was viewed as a legacy of imperialism upon the global south     The term was widely used by the MacBride Commission  a UNESCO panel chaired by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Se n MacBride  which was charged with creation of a set of recommendations to make global media representation more equitable  The MacBride Commission produced a report titled  Many Voices  One World   which outlined the main philosophical points of the New World Information Communication Order   Contents    History   Issues   Responses within the United States   Developments      Windhoek Declaration

References   Further reading   History edit  The fundamental issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time  The American media scholar Wilbur Schramm noted in      that the flow of news among nations is thin  that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less developing ones  that important events are ignored and reality is distorted     From a more radical perspective  Herbert Schiller observed in      that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about radio frequency allocations for satellites at a key meeting in Geneva in          Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications  Intelsat which was set up for international co operation in satellite communication  was also dominated by the United States  In the     s these and other issues were taken up by the Non Aligned Movement and debated within the United Nations and UNESCO   In       at the   th Congress of a UNESCO  the NWICO was clearly raised for the first time  NWICO grew out of the New International Economic Order of       From            the New World Information and Communication Order was generally called the shorter New World Information Order or the New International Information Order  In       for the first time  the slogan of establishing a  New World Information and Communication Order  was clearly proposed  At the start of this discussion  NWICO got associated with the United Nations Education  Scientific and Cultural Organization  UNESCO  starting from the early     s  Mass media concerns began with the meeting of non aligned nations in Algiers        again in Tunis       and later in      at the New Delhi Ministerial Conference of Non Aligned Nations  The  new order  plan was textually formulated by Tunisia s Information Minister Mustapha Masmoudi  Masmoudi submitted working paper No     to the MacBride Commission  These proposals of      were titled the  Mass Media Declaration   The MacBride Commission at the time was a    member body created by UNESCO to study communication issues     unreliable source   The UNESCO work on the NWICO was immediately met with criticism from many areas  An interim report released in      by UNESCO was targeted by the American Newspaper Publishers Association and the American Society of Newspaper Editors  While these organizations took issue with some of the early proposals including right of reply and press councils  they also were troubled by the phrase  New World Information and Communication Order   seeing it as a dog whistle for the use of government propaganda in the guise of information flow balance     In      the MacBride Report was finally published  The report stated that the right to inform and be informed was critical to modern societies  and that information was a key resource  The report than proposed five main ideas of action to progress these goals  Include communication as a fundamental right  Reduce imbalances in the news structure  Strengthen a global strategy for communication while respecting cultural identities and individual rights  Promote the creation of national communication policies to be coherent and lasting in the processes of development  Explore how the NWICO could be used to benefit a New International Economic Order  NIEO       Following the release of the report director general Amadou Mahtar M Bow was reelected as the head of UNESCO  and those in favor of the NWICO movement found the report giving them strength  UNESCO received a thirty four percent increase in funding  and the United States agreed in principle to creating a new international body for communication in developing countries  within the framework of UNESCO   The report itself was controversial  as many viewed it as lending strength to the Communist and nonaligned blocs  M Bow backed a compromise resolution that eliminated the more radical proposals of the report  however hard liners resisted these changes  Likewise  the United States warned that they would not provide funds or technical assistance if UNESCO appeared to desire government control of media     In December      the United Nations formally endorsed the MacBride Report by saying that nations should  take into account  the report in framing of communications policy  The resolution also invited members to promote  the widespread circulation and study  of the report  While not a binding resolution  this move was met with immediate criticism from the British government  saying they did not regard the report as definitive     In       the   nd edition of UNESCO established the medium term plan for the establishment of NWICO from      to       The struggle to establish a new world information order won broad support within the United Nations  Among those involved in the movement were the Latin American Institute for the Study of Transnationals  ILET   One of its co founders  Juan Somavia was a member of the MacBride Commission  Another important voice was Mustapha Masmoudi  the Information Minister for Tunisia  In a Canadian radio program in       Tom McPhail describes how the issues were pressed within UNESCO in the mid     s when the United States withheld funding to punish the organization for excluding Israel from a regional group of UNESCO  Some OPEC countries and a few socialist countries made up the amount of money and were able to get senior positions within UNESCO  NWICO issues were then advanced at an important meeting in      held in Costa Rica  The only woman member of the Commission was Betty Zimmerman  representing Canada because of the illness of Marshall McLuhan  who died in       The movement was kept alive through the     s by meetings of the MacBride Round Table on Communication  even though by then the leadership of UNESCO distanced itself from its ideas  The UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity of      puts into effect some of the goals of NWICO  especially with regard to the unbalanced global flow of mass media  However  this convention was not supported by the United States  and it does not appear to be as robust as World Trade Organization agreements that support global trade in mass media and information   Issues edit  A wide range of issues were raised as part of NWICO discussions  Some of these involved long standing issues of media coverage of the developing world and unbalanced flows of media influence  But other issues involved new technologies with important military and commercial uses  The developing world was likely to be marginalized by satellite and computer technologies  The issues included   News reporting on the developing world that reflects the priorities of news agencies in London  Paris and New York  Reporting of natural disasters and military coups rather than the fundamental realities  At the time four major news agencies controlled over     of global news flow  citation needed  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states  everyone has the right     to seek  receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers   This was used by supporters to claim the NWICO discussions were  at their core  based upon human rights     An unbalanced flow of mass media from the developed world  especially the United States  to the underdeveloped countries  Everyone watches American movies and television shows  Advertising agencies in the developed world have indirect but significant effects on mass media in the developing countries  Some observers also judged the messages of these ads to be inappropriate for the Third World  An unfair division of the radio spectrum  A small number of developed countries controlled almost     of the radio spectrum  Much of this was for military use  There were similar concerns about the allocation of the geostationary orbit  parking spots in space  for satellites  At the time only a small number of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later  This might mean eventually getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate  Satellite broadcasting of television signals into Third World countries without prior permission was widely perceived as a threat to national sovereignty  The UN voted in the early     s against such broadcasts  Use of satellites to collect information on crops and natural resources in the Third World at a time when most developing countries lacked the capacity to analyze this data  At the time most mainframe computers were located in the United States and there were concerns about the location of databases  such as airline reservations  and the difficulty of developing countries catching up with the US lead in computers  The protection of journalists from violence was raised as an issue for discussion  For example  journalists were targeted by various military dictatorships in Latin America in the     s  As part of NWICO debates there were suggestions for study on how to protect journalists and even to discipline journalists who broke  generally recognized ethical standards   However  the MacBride Commission specifically came out against the idea of licensing journalists      Responses within the United States edit  The United States government was hostile to NWICO  According to some analysts  the United States saw these issues simply as barriers to the free flow of communication and to the interests of American media corporations  Corporate media lobbyists were incensed at any critical portrayal of the private sector in communication  This centrist view described NWICO as dangerous to freedom of the press by ultimately putting an organization run by governments at the head of controlling global media  potentially allowing for censorship on a large scale There were also accusations of corruption at the highest level of UNESCO leadership in Paris   While the Carter administration had been responsive to the goals of UNESCO  the Reagan administration took on a different approach  The work of UNESCO was perceived by this administration to limit both individual and press freedoms  Additionally  anti communist cold war sentiments were gaining increased traction in the United States  The US eventually withdrew its membership in UNESCO at the end of           The matter was complicated by debates within UNESCO about Israel s archaeological work in the city of Jerusalem  and about the Apartheid regime in South Africa  citation needed  The United States rejoined in           The Independent Media Center was established in Seattle  USA  on November    of      as a cluster of independent news media and websites  IMC is a new media collective hosted by grassroots organizations generally supportive of the intent of NWICO  while pointing out  st amendment concerns along the way   Founded by a grass roots synthesis of anti Neoliberalists and activists  IMC was considered to be a pioneering effort to gain freedom of the press  and theoretically part of a more democratic  new world information order    Developments edit  The debate on the NWICO that started in the     s reflected criticism about non equitable access to information and media imperialism  The NWICO saw the United Kingdom and the United States back out of UNESCO until      for the UK and      for the US  In            a switch occurred globally  carried by the Internet that contributed to bring more equity to the available content  This was supported by the extension of media powers to developing countries such as Mexico  Korea  Kenya and Nigeria  by the adoption of protectionist measures in regards to the free market by western countries like Canada and France  and with the rise of satellite broadcasting as a transnational means for non western countries      Still  evidence suggests global media has a strong bias towards the global north  Studies estimate around eighty percent of international news travels through Reuters  Agence France Press  United Press International  and the Associated Press  Only around twenty percent of this news focuses on developing countries  In the decades following the NWICO debates little changed in this regard as a study on stories relating to Africa in the New York Times and The Washington Post showed in       In this study of    articles  all lacked sufficient context linking the West to Africa  and seventy five of them were negative in content       Windhoek Declaration edit  Main article  Windhoek Declaration This tendency has reached its peak in the      Windhoek Declaration  The Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free  Independent and Pluralistic Press is a statement of press freedom principles by African newspaper journalists      African diplomats in Paris  UNESCO   Geneva  ECOSOC  and New York s  UN General Assembly  commitment has been crucial to the success of the Windhoek process      UNESCO endorsed the Windhoek Declaration and United Nations General Assembly recognized the   May  date of the Declaration  as  World Press Freedom Day       The Windhoek Declaration has had other significant impacts in the media field  UNESCO adopted the Windhoek framework concerning media development  characterizing it by freedom  pluralism and independence      The Windhoek Declaration is implemented through the Media Development Indicators  MDIs  framework     developed by the International Programme for the Development of Communication Intergovernmental Council in           Resonating with the NWICO  the MDIs help assessing the priority areas for media development that are the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism  the development of community media and of human resources       International Programme for the Development of Communication  IPDC  edit  Main article  International Programme for the Development of Communication As a result of the  Many Voices  One World       report UNESCO s General Conference launched the International Programme for the Development of Communication  IPDC  the same year in Belgrade  The Programme was adopted by    Member States and aimed at strengthening the development of mass media in developing countries  Its mandate since      is      to contribute to sustainable development  democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press        World Summit on the Information Society  WSIS  edit  Main article  World Summit on the Information Society In December of      in Geneva and November of       two phases of the UN World Summit on the Information Society  WSIS  were held  These gatherings were done to develop a  common vision of the information society  and to overcome the digital divide within the United Nations Millennial Development Goals  This process involved both governmental actors as well as non governmental organizations and sought to solve many of the issues proposed during the NWICO debate  Critics have noted that WSIS was too narrow minded a process and focused exclusively on an information technology approach       Safety of journalists edit  Main article  Safety of journalists Threats on journalists are one of the major issues blocking media development  Since       UNESCO Member States submit information on the status of the judicial inquiries conducted on each of the journalists killings condemned by the Organization  This information is included in a public report submitted every two years to the IPDC Council by the Director General and is basis to the Programme s follow up to killings of journalists       Technological developments edit  Main article  Access to information Technological developments have direct effects on access to information and on privacy  Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek  receive and impart information effectively  According to Guy Berger   access to digital means of communication  even within the limits established by platform owners  is unprecedented       Since the NWICO debate  many of the desired developments have come about through access to the internet and mobile phones  Many are now able to seek as well as impart information to the public  The one way information flow from Global North to South has been corrected partially due to this flow of information  The biggest barrier is now lack of access  and as of      only one third of the population has such access  with some of the poorest regions having less than     access       There has been a signi cant increase in access to the Internet in recent years  which reached just over three billion users in       amounting to about    per cent of the world s population      Nevertheless  issues remain such as the digital divide  the gender divide and the security argument  A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to  use of  or impact of information and communication technologies  ICT       Social barriers such as illiteracy and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities between men and women in navigating the tools used for access to information  it s the gender divide      With the evolution of the digital age  application of freedom of speech and its corollaries  freedom of information  access to information  becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger          The increasing access to and reliance on digital media to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals  behaviors  opinions and networks  States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication  justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests  In parts of Europe  new anti terrorism laws have enabled a greater degree of government surveillance and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens  data  While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights  the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity  proportionality and legitimate purpose       See
