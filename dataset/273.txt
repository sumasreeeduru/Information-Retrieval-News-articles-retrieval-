the editorial  which became the most important in America     and thereon I decided to print opinions  ignoring facts     Swope included only opinions by employees of his newspaper  leaving the  modern  op ed page to be developed in      under the direction of The New York Times editor John B  Oakes     The first op ed page of The New York Times appeared on    September           Writes media
