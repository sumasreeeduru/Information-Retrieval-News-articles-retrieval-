other pre taped shows from CNBC s different international channels  e g  CNBC TV    are also seen on the channel  along with CNBC Prime reality programming such as American Greed and other CNBC specials are shown  in order to force viewers to tune in to the main CNBC service for business information outside the Eurasian market days  As of       the network is not offered in high definition
