 In many countries  one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi  However  in Oman  asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger s newness and unfamiliarity with the area  One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one s journey from one s hotel or host before looking for a taxi  Taxis will also generally take passengers to

result as much from geography and history as from culture and economics      The relatively recent and artificial nature of the state of Oman makes it difficult to describe a national culture      however  sufficient cultural heterogeneity exists within its national boundaries to make Oman distinct from other Arab States of the Persian Gulf      Oman s cultural diversity is greater than that of its Arab neighbours  given its historical expansion to the Swahili Coast and the Indian Ocean      Oman has a long tradition of shipbuilding  as maritime travel played a major role in the Omanis
