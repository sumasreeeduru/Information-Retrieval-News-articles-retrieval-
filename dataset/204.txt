from Old French contr e  which derives from Vulgar Latin  terra  contrata    land  lying opposite     land  spread before    derived from contra   against  opposite    It most likely entered the English language after the Franco Norman invasion during the   th century  In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions  so that one sense  associated with the indefinite article    a country    through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a synonym for state  or a former sovereign state  in the sense of sovereign territory or  district  native land       Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the West Country in England  the Black Country  a heavily industrialized part of England    Constable Country   a part of East Anglia painted by John Constable   the  big country   used in various contexts of the American West    coal country   used of parts of the US and elsewhere  and many other terms      The equivalent terms in French and other Romance languages  pays and variants  have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English  country   instead derived from  pagus  which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count  a title originally granted by the Catholic Church  In many European countries the words are used for sub divisions of the national territory  as in the German Bundesl nder  as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state  France has very many  pays  that are officially recognized at some level  and are either natural regions  like the Pays de Bray  or reflect old political or economic entities  like the Pays de la Loire  A version of  country  can be found in the modern French language as contr e  based on the word cuntr e in Old French      that is used similarly to the word  pays  to define non state regions  but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases  The modern Italian contrada is a word with its meaning varying locally  but usually meaning a ward or similar small division of a town  or a village or hamlet in the countryside   Country names edit  See also  List of country name

status edit  See also  List of sovereign states The term  country  can refer to a sovereign state  There is no universal agreement on the number of  countries  in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status  By one application of the declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood  there are     sovereign states  of which     are members of the United Nations  two have observer status at the United Nations General Assembly  UNGA   the Holy See and Palestine   and    others are neither a member nor observer at the UNGA  The latest proclaimed state is South Sudan since       The degree of autonomy of non sovereign countries varies widely  Some are possessions of sovereign states  as several states have overseas territories  such as French Polynesia or the British Virgin Islands   with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own  Such territories  with the exception of distinct dependent territories  are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries  but may nonetheless be treated as a separate  country of origin  in international trade  as Hong Kong is              A few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries   The Kingdom of the Netherlands includes four separate countries  Netherlands  Aruba  Cura ao  and Sint Maarten  The United Kingdom includes the four countries England  Scotland  Wales  and Northern Ireland  The Crown Dependencies  which are not part of the UK itself  are also sometimes referred to as countries  The Danish Realm consists of Denmark proper and its two autonomous territories  the Faroe Islands and Greenland  Country classification edit  Several organizations seek to identify trends in order to produce country classifications  Countries are often distinguished as developing countries or developed countries  The United Nations The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually produces the World Economic Situation and Prospects report that classified states as developed countries  economies in transition  or developing countries  The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income  Within the broad categories  the United Nations identified subgroups based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria  The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies as Africa  East Asia  South Asia  Western Asia  and Latin America and the Caribbean  The      report recognizes only developed countries in North America  Europe  and Asia and the Pacific  The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa  Asia  and Latin America and the Caribbean   The UN additionally recognizes multiple trends that impact the developmental status of countries in the World Economic Situation and Prospects  The report highlights fuel exporting and fuel importing countries  as well as small island developing states and landlocked developing countries  It also identifies heavily indebted poor countries      The World Bank The World Bank also classifies countries based on GNI per capita  Using the World Bank Atlas method  it classifies countries as low income economies  lower middle income economies  upper middle income economies  or high income economies  For the      fiscal year  the World Bank defines low income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of        or less in       lower middle income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between        and         upper middle income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between        and          high income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of         or more      It also identifies regional trends  The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific  Europe and Central Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean  Middle East and North Africa  North America  South Asia  and Sub Saharan Africa  Lastly  the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank  The three categories include International Development Association  IDA  countries  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD  countries  and Blend countries   See also edit    Countries portal Geography portal City network Constituent state List of sovereign states and dependent
