television  Al Jazeera Mubasher  AJM  Arabic                  is a television channel launched by Al Jazeera Media Network originally on April           It is an all Arabic channel based in Doha  Qatar that broadcasts conferences and other events live without editing or commentary  using subtitles when translation is needed  The channel is also sometimes referred to as Al Jazeera Live     as Mubasher is an Arabic word for Live  as in live broadcast  and Al  Amma is Arabic for General  The channel was formerly called just Al Jazeera Mubasher  Al Jazeera Mubasher Al  Amma is the first channel of its kind in the Arab world and is similar to the U S  channel C SPAN and UK channel BBC Parliament  The channel also has a live stream of its broadcast on its website  In       the channel underwent a graphics upgrade as part of Al Jazeera Media Networks graphics upgrade across the company  Launched in April       Al Jazeera Mubasher is the first Middle Eastern    hour live news and events channel  Acting as the eyes and ears of the Arab world  the channel is dedicated to giving viewers real time footage of global and regional events  The channel has remote feeds and on the ground cameras broadcasting political gatherings  press conferences  discussions  and meetings  bringing audiences the latest on political  social  cultural and economic affairs  When people want events as they happen  they turn to Al Jazeera Mubasher live and uncut  On December          it was announced that Al Jazeera Media Network would coalesce both Al Jazeera Mubasher and the temporarily suspended Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr in to a new combined channel called Al Jazeera Al  Amma  AJMG  or Al Jazeera Live General     The new Al Jazeera Mubasher Al  Amma  reports live events from all over the globe simultaneously with round the clock analysis  The channel s focus is to ensure interaction between viewers and unfolding events  The channel is built to serve as an open space for viewers to air their views rather than them simply receiving information  The output rely much on viewer suggestions rather than a traditional pattern of fixed transmission grid   Egyptian channel edit  A similar channel called Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr  AJMM  Arabic                      similar to its original sister channel minus some commentary operated in Egypt based in Cairo from      to       The channel functioned similar to its main counterpart but was shut down by the Egyptian government after the removal of Mohamed Morsi due to its pro Brotherhood slant  The channel s staff were arrested but later released  In the period from      until its suspension it broadcast from Al Jazeera s Doha  headquarters running video brought in through other sources such as YouTube and Reuters and press conferences taped from other news organizations in the country  Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr has meanwhile temporarily ceased broadcasting until such time as necessary permits are issued for its return to Cairo in coordination with the Egyptian authorities  Al Jazeera Mubasher Al Amma is therefore transmitting on the frequencies of both Al Jazeera Mubasher and Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr      References
