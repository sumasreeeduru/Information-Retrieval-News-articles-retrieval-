genocide of the European Jews  Between      and       across German occupied Europe  Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews  around two thirds of Europe s Jewish population  a  d  The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings  by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps  and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps  chiefly Auschwitz  Be  ec  Che mno  Majdanek  Sobib r  and Treblinka in occupied Poland     Germany implemented the persecution in stages  Following Adolf Hitler s appointment as Chancellor on    January       the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed  undesirable   starting with Dachau on    March          After the passing of the Enabling Act on    March     which gave Hitler plenary powers  the government began isolating Jews from civil society  this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April      and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September       On      November       eight months after Germany annexed Austria  Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as Kristallnacht  the  Night of Broken Glass    After Germany invaded Poland in September       triggering World War II  the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews  Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German occupied Europe  The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question  discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January       As German forces captured territories in the East  all anti Jewish measures were radicalized  Under the coordination of the SS  with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party  killings were committed within Germany itself  throughout occupied Europe  and within territories controlled by Germany s allies  Paramilitary death squads called Einsatzgruppen  in cooperation with the German Army and local collaborators  murdered around     million Jews in mass shootings and pogroms between      and       By mid       victims were being deported from ghettos across Europe in sealed freight trains to extermination camps where  if they survived the journey  they were gassed  worked or beaten to death  or killed by disease or during death marches  The killing continued until the end of World War II in Europe in May       The European Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event during the Holocaust era                    in which Germany and its collaborators persecuted and murdered other groups  including ethnic Poles  Soviet civilians and prisoners of war  the Roma  the handicapped  political and religious dissidents  and gay men  e  The death toll of these other groups is thought to be over    million  b

Ottoman Muslims     comes from the Greek              romanized  hol kaustos       h los   whole            kaust s   burnt offering   f  The biblical term shoah  Hebrew             meaning  destruction   became the standard Hebrew term for the murder of the European Jews  According to Haaretz  the writer Yehuda Erez may have been the first to describe events in Germany as the shoah  Davar and later Haaretz both used the term in September           g  Yom HaShoah became Israel s Holocaust Remembrance Day in           On   October      the American Hebrew used the phrase  before the Holocaust   apparently to refer to the situation in France      and in May      the New York Times  discussing the Bermuda Conference  referred to the  hundreds of thousands of European Jews still surviving the Nazi Holocaust       In      the Library of Congress created a new category   Holocaust  Jewish                   The term was popularised in the United States by the NBC mini series Holocaust         about a fictional family of German Jews      and in November that year the President s Commission on the Holocaust was established      As non Jewish groups began to include themselves as Holocaust victims  many Jews chose to use the Hebrew terms Shoah or Churban      h  The Nazis used the phrase  Final Solution to the Jewish Question   German  die Endl sung der Judenfrage        Definition Most Holocaust historians define the Holocaust as the genocide of the European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between      and       a  Michael Gray  a specialist in Holocaust education      offers three definitions   a   the persecution and murder of Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators between      and        which views Kristallnacht in      as an early phase of the Holocaust   b   the systematic mass murder of the Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between      and        which recognises the policy shift in      toward extermination  and  c   the persecution and murder of various groups by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between      and        which includes all the Nazis  victims  a definition that fails  Gray writes  to acknowledge that only the Jews were singled out for annihilation      Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia  in The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust         favor a definition that focuses on the Jews  Roma and handicapped   the systematic  state sponsored murder of entire groups determined by heredity       The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum distinguishes between the Holocaust  the murder of six million Jews  and  the era of the Holocaust   which began when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January           Victims of the era of the Holocaust include those the Nazis viewed as inherently inferior  chiefly Slavs  the Roma and the handicapped   and those targeted because of their beliefs or behavior  such as Jehovah s Witnesses  communists and homosexuals       Peter Hayes writes that the persecution of these groups was less consistent than that of the Jews  the Nazis  treatment of the Slavs  for example  consisted of  enslavement and gradual attrition   while some Slavs  Hayes lists Bulgarians  Croats  Slovaks and some Ukrainians  were favored      Against this  Hitler regarded the Jews as what Dan Stone calls  a Gegenrasse  a  counter race      not really human at all   e   Distinctive features Genocidal state Further information  List of Nazi concentration camps German occupied Europe      Concentration camps  extermination camps  and ghettos       borders  extermination camps highlighted  The logistics of the mass murder turned Germany into what Michael Berenbaum called a  genocidal state       Eberhard J ckel wrote in      during the German Historikerstreit a dispute among historians about the uniqueness of the Holocaust and its relationship with the crimes of the Soviet Union that it was the first time a state had thrown its power behind the idea that an entire people should be wiped out  i  Anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was to be exterminated      and complex rules were devised to deal with Mischlinge   mixed breeds        Bureaucrats identified who was a Jew  confiscated property  and scheduled trains to deport them  Companies fired Jews and later used them as slave labor  Universities dismissed Jewish faculty and students  German pharmaceutical companies tested drugs on camp prisoners  other companies built the crematoria      As prisoners entered the death camps  they surrendered all personal property      which was cataloged and tagged before being sent to Germany for reuse or recycling      Through a concealed account  the German National Bank helped launder valuables stolen from the victims       Collaboration Main articles  Responsibility for the Holocaust  Collaboration with the Axis Powers  and German occupied Europe Dan Stone writes that since the opening of archives following the fall of former communist states in Eastern Europe  it has become increasingly clear that the Holocaust was a pan European phenomenon  a series of  Holocausts  impossible to conduct without the help of local collaborators  Without collaborators  the Germans could not have extended the killing across most of the continent      j      According to Donald Bloxham  in many parts of Europe  extreme collective violence was becoming an accepted measure of resolving identity crises       Christian Gerlach writes that non Germans  not under German command  killed     percent of the six million  but that their involvement was crucial in other ways      The industrialization and scale of the murder was unprecedented  Killings were systematically conducted in virtually all areas of occupied Europe more than    occupied countries      Nearly three million Jews in occupied Poland and between         and     million Jews in the Soviet Union were killed  Hundreds of thousands more died in the rest of Europe      Some Christian churches defended converted Jews  but otherwise  Saul Friedl nder wrote in        Not one social group  not one religious community  not one scholarly institution or professional association in Germany and throughout Europe declared its solidarity with the Jews           Medical experiments Main articles  Nazi human experimentation and Doctors

    prisoners were subjected to experiments  most died as a result  during the experiments or later      Twenty three senior physicians and other medical personnel were charged at Nuremberg  after the war  with crimes against humanity  They included the head of the German Red Cross  tenured professors  clinic directors  and biomedical researchers      Experiments took place at Auschwitz  Buchenwald  Dachau  Natzweiler Struthof  Neuengamme  Ravensbr ck  Sachsenhausen  and elsewhere  Some dealt with sterilization of men and women  the treatment of war wounds  ways to counteract chemical weapons  research into new vaccines and drugs  and the survival of harsh conditions      The most notorious physician was Josef Mengele  an SS officer who became the Auschwitz camp doctor on    May

Antisemitism and the v lkisch movement See also  History of the Jews in Germany  Christianity and antisemitism  Martin Luther and antisemitism  Religious antisemitism  and Racial antisemitism Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe  Jews were subjected to antisemitism based on Christian theology  which blamed them for killing Jesus  Even after the Reformation  Catholicism and Lutheranism continued to persecute Jews  accusing them of blood libels and subjecting them to pogroms and expulsions      The second half of the   th century saw the emergence in the German empire and Austria Hungary of the v lkisch movement  developed by such thinkers as Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Paul de Lagarde  The movement embraced a pseudo scientific racism that viewed Jews as a race whose members were locked in mortal combat with the Aryan race for world domination      These ideas became commonplace throughout Germany  the professional classes adopted an ideology that did not see humans as racial equals with equal hereditary value      The Nazi Party  the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or National Socialist German Workers  Party  originated as an offshoot of

Hitler  antisemitism and the Holocaust  Mein Kampf  and Historiography of Adolf Hitler After World War I              many Germans did not accept that their country had been defeated  which gave birth to the stab in the back myth  This insinuated that it was disloyal politicians  chiefly Jews and communists  who had orchestrated Germany s surrender  Inflaming the anti Jewish sentiment was the apparent over representation of Jews in the leadership of communist revolutionary governments in Europe  such as Ernst Toller  head of a short lived revolutionary government in Bavaria  This perception contributed to the canard of Jewish Bolshevism      Early antisemites in the Nazi Party included Dietrich Eckart  publisher of the V lkischer Beobachter  the party s newspaper  and Alfred Rosenberg  who wrote antisemitic articles for it in the     s  Rosenberg s vision of a secretive Jewish conspiracy ruling the world would influence Hitler s views of Jews by making them the driving force behind communism       Central to Hitler s world view was the idea of expansion and Lebensraum  living space  in Eastern Europe for German Aryans  a policy of what Doris Bergen called  race and space   Open about his hatred of Jews  he subscribed to common antisemitic stereotypes      From the early     s onwards  he compared the Jews to germs and said they should be dealt with in the same way  He viewed Marxism as a Jewish doctrine  said he was fighting against  Jewish Marxism   and believed that Jews had created communism as part of a conspiracy to destroy Germany       Rise of Nazi

January      of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany and the Nazi s seizure of power  German leaders proclaimed the rebirth of the Volksgemeinschaft   people s community        Nazi policies divided the population into two groups  the Volksgenossen   national comrades   who belonged to the Volksgemeinschaft  and the Gemeinschaftsfremde   community aliens   who did not  Enemies were divided into three groups  the  racial  or  blood  enemies  such as the Jews and Roma  political opponents of Nazism  such as Marxists  liberals  Christians  and the  reactionaries  viewed as wayward  national comrades   and moral opponents  such as gay men  the work shy  and habitual criminals  The latter two groups were to be sent to concentration camps for  re education   with the aim of eventual absorption into the Volksgemeinschaft   Racial  enemies could never belong to the Volksgemeinschaft  they were to be removed from society      Before and after the March      Reichstag elections  the Nazis intensified their campaign of violence against opponents      setting up concentration camps for extrajudicial imprisonment      One of the first  at Dachau  opened on    March           Initially the camp contained mostly Communists and Social Democrats      Other early prisons were consolidated by mid      into purpose built camps outside the cities  run exclusively by the SS      The camps served as a deterrent by terrorizing Germans who did not support the regime      Throughout the     s  the legal  economic  and social rights of Jews were steadily restricted     On   April       there was a boycott of Jewish businesses      On   April       the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed  which excluded Jews and other  non Aryans  from the civil service      Jews were disbarred from practicing law  being editors or proprietors of newspapers  joining the Journalists  Association  or owning farms      In Silesia  in March       a group of men

some members of the German medical establishment to advocate compulsory sterilization of the  incurable  mentally and physically handicapped      people the Nazis called Lebensunwertes Leben  life unworthy of life       On    July       the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring  Gesetz zur Verh tung erbkranken Nachwuchses   the Sterilization Law  was passed          The New York Times reported on    December that year           Germans to be sterilized       There were        applications from doctors in the first year  The courts reached a decision in        of those cases         were in favor of sterilization      Estimates for the number of involuntary sterilizations during the whole of the Third Reich range from         to              In October      Hitler signed a  euthanasia decree  backdated to   September      that authorized Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler  the chief of Hitler s Chancellery  and Karl Brandt  Hitler s personal physician  to carry out a program of involuntary euthanasia  After the war this program came to be known as Aktion T       named after Tiergartenstra e    the address of a villa in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten  where the various organizations involved were headquartered      T  was mainly directed at adults  but the euthanasia of children was also carried out      Between      and              to         mentally ill

looting  destruction of property  and terror on an unprecedented scale        Known as Kristallnacht  or  Night of Broken Glass    the attacks on      November      were partly carried out by the SS and SA       but ordinary Germans joined in  in some areas  the violence began before the SS or SA arrived       Over       Jewish shops  out of        were looted and attacked  and over       synagogs damaged or destroyed  Groups of Jews were forced by the crowd to watch their synagogs burn  in Bensheim they were made to dance around it  and in Laupheim to kneel before it       At least    Jews died  The damage was estimated at    million Reichmarks       Cesarani writes that   t he extent of the desolation stunned the population and rocked the regime        It also shocked the rest of the world  The Times of London wrote on    November        No foreign propagandist bent upon blackening Germany before the world could outdo the tale of burnings and beatings  of blackguardly assaults upon defenseless and innocent people  which disgraced that country yesterday  Either the German authorities were a party to this outbreak or their powers over public order and a hooligan minority are not what they are proudly claimed to be        Between   and    November         Jews were sent to the Buchenwald  Dachau  and Sachsenhausen concentration camps       Many were released within weeks

Insurance payments for damage to their property were confiscated by the government  A decree on    November      barred Jews from most remaining occupations       Kristallnacht marked the end of any

mass deportation from Europe of German  and later European  Jewry       Among the areas considered for possible resettlement were British Palestine and  after the war began  French Madagascar       Siberia  and two reservations in Poland       m  Palestine was the only location to which any German resettlement plan produced results  via the Haavara Agreement between the Zionist Federation of Germany and the German government  Between November      and December       the agreement resulted in the emigration of about        German Jews  who were allowed to transfer RM     million of their

the number of Jews in every European country      v  SS Obergruppenf hrer Reinhard Heydrich  head of the Reich Security Head Office  RSHA   convened what became known as the Wannsee Conference on    January      at Am Gro en Wannsee        a villa in Berlin s Wannsee suburb            The meeting had been scheduled for   December       and invitations had been sent on    November  but it had been postponed indefinitely  A month later  invitations were sent out again  this time for    January       The    men present at Wannsee included Adolf Eichmann  head of Jewish affairs for the RSHA   Heinrich M ller  head of the Gestapo   and other SS and party leaders and department heads  w  Browning writes that eight of the    had doctorates   Thus it was not a dimwitted crowd unable to grasp

folder       Written by Eichmann and stamped  Top Secret   the minutes were written in  euphemistic language  on Heydrich s instructions  according to Eichmann s later testimony       Discussing plans for a  final solution to the Jewish question    Endl sung der Judenfrage    and a  final solution to the Jewish question in Europe    Endl sung der europ ischen Judenfrage         the conference was

whether to include the German Mischlinge  half Jews        Heydrich told the meeting   Another possible solution of the problem has now taken the place of emigration  i e  the evacuation of the Jews to the East  provided that the Fuehrer gives the appropriate approval in advance        He continued   Under proper guidance  in the course of the Final Solution  the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East  Able bodied Jews  separated according to sex  will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads  in the course of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes  The possible final remnant will  since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion  have to be treated accordingly because it is the product of natural selection and would  if released  act as the seed of a new Jewish revival   See the experience of history   In the course of the practical execution of the Final Solution  Europe will be combed through from west to east  Germany proper  including the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia  will have to be handled first due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities The evacuated Jews will first be sent  group by group  to so called transit ghettos  from which they will be transported to the East       These evacuations were regarded as provisional or  temporary solutions    Ausweichm glichkeiten         x  The final solution would encompass the    million Jews living not only in territories controlled by Germany  but elsewhere in Europe and adjacent territories  such as Britain  Ireland  Switzerland  Turkey  Sweden  Portugal  Spain  and Hungary   dependent on military developments        There was little doubt what the final solution was

vans       Mauthausen in Austria       Stutthof  near Gda sk  Poland       and Sachsenhausen and Ravensbr ck in Germany  The camps in Austria  Germany and Poland all had gas chambers to kill inmates deemed unable to work        Gas vans Main article  Gas van Che mno  with gas vans only  had its roots in the Aktion T  euthanasia program       In December      and January       gas vans equipped with gas cylinders and a sealed compartment had been used to kill the handicapped in occupied Poland       As the mass shootings continued in Russia  Himmler and his subordinates in the field feared that the murders were causing psychological problems for the SS       and began searching for more efficient methods  In December       similar vans  using exhaust fumes rather than bottled gas  were introduced into the camp at Che mno       Victims were asphyxiated while being driven to prepared burial pits in the nearby forests       The vans were also used in the occupied Soviet Union  for example in smaller clearing actions in the Minsk ghetto       and in Yugoslavia       Apparently  as with the mass shootings  the vans caused emotional problems for the operators  and the small number of victims the vans could handle made them ineffective        Gas chambers Main article  Gas chamber Further information  Sonderaktion      Auschwitz II gatehouse  shot from inside the camp  the trains delivered victims very close to the gas chambers Women on their way to the gas chamber  near Crematorium V  Auschwitz II  August       The Polish resistance reportedly smuggled the film  known as the Sonderkommando photographs  out of the camp in a toothpaste tube       Christian Gerlach writes that over three million Jews were murdered in       the year that  marked the peak  of the mass murder       At least     million of these were in the General Government area of Poland       Victims usually arrived at the extermination camps by freight train       Almost all arrivals at Be  ec  Sobib r and Treblinka were sent directly to the gas chambers       with individuals occasionally selected to replace dead workers       At Auschwitz  about    percent of Jews were selected to work       Those selected for death at all camps were told to undress and hand their valuables to camp workers      They were then herded naked into the gas chambers  To prevent panic  they were told the gas chambers were showers or delousing chambers       At Auschwitz  after the chambers were filled  the doors were shut and pellets of Zyklon B were dropped into the chambers through vents       releasing toxic prussic acid       Those inside died within    minutes  the speed of death depended on how close the inmate was standing to a gas vent  according to the commandant Rudolf H ss  who estimated that about one third of the victims died immediately       Johann Kremer  an SS doctor who oversaw the gassings  testified that   Shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives        The gas was then pumped out  and the Sonderkommando work groups of mostly Jewish prisoners carried out the bodies  extracted gold fillings  cut off women s hair  and removed jewelry  artificial limbs and glasses       At Auschwitz  the bodies were at first buried in deep pits and covered with lime  but between September and November       on the orders of Himmler          bodies were dug up and burned  In early       new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers       Be  ec  Sobib r and Treblinka became known as the Operation Reinhard camps  named after the German plan to murder the Jews in the General Government area of occupied Poland       Between March      and November       around           Jews were gassed in these three camps in gas chambers using carbon monoxide from the exhaust fumes of stationary diesel engines     Gold fillings were pulled from the corpses before burial  but unlike in Auschwitz the women s hair was cut before death  At Treblinka  to calm the victims  the arrival platform was made to look like a train station  complete with fake clock       Most of the victims at these three camps were buried in pits at first  From mid       as part of Sonderaktion       prisoners at Auschwitz  Chelmno  Be  ec  Sobib r  and Treblinka were forced to exhume and burn bodies that had been buried  in part to hide the evidence  and in part because of the terrible smell pervading the camps and a fear that the drinking water would become polluted       The corpses         in Treblinka were burned on wood in open fire pits and the remaining bones crushed into powder        Jewish resistance Main articles  Warsaw Ghetto Uprising  Jewish resistance in German occupied

was reached       Several resistance groups were formed  such as the Jewish Combat Organization   OB  and Jewish Military Union   ZW  in the Warsaw Ghetto and the United Partisan Organization in Vilna       Over     revolts and uprisings occurred in at least    ghettos and elsewhere in Eastern Europe  The best known is the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April       when the Germans arrived to send the remaining inhabitants to extermination camps  Forced to retreat on    April from the  OB and  ZW fighters  they returned later that day under the command of SS General J rgen Stroop  author of the Stroop Report about the uprising        Around       poorly armed fighters held the SS at bay for four weeks       Polish and Jewish accounts stated that hundreds or thousands of Germans had been killed       while the Germans reported    dead       The Germans said that        Jews had been killed      during the fighting and      sent to Treblinka      and between             and        deported       According to Gwardia Ludowa  a Polish resistance newspaper  in May        From behind the screen of smoke and fire  in which the ranks of fighting Jewish partisans are dying  the legend of the exceptional fighting qualities of the Germans is being undermined      The fighting Jews have won for us what is most important  the truth about the weakness of the Germans        During a revolt in Treblinka on   August       inmates killed five or six guards and set fire to camp buildings  several managed to escape       In the Bia ystok Ghetto on    August  Jewish insurgents fought for five days when the Germans announced mass deportations       On    October  Jewish prisoners in Sobib r attempted an escape  killing    SS officers  as well as two or three Ukrainian and Volksdeutsche guards  According to Yitzhak Arad  this was the highest number of SS officers killed in a single revolt       Around     inmates escaped  out of     in the main camp   but     were recaptured and shot       On   October           Jewish members  mostly Greek or Hungarian  of the Sonderkommando at Auschwitz learned they were about to be killed  and staged an uprising  blowing up crematorium IV       Three SS officers were killed       The Sonderkommando at crematorium II threw their Oberkapo into an oven when they heard the commotion  believing that a camp uprising had begun       By the time the SS had regained control      members of the Sonderkommando were dead      survived       Estimates of Jewish participation in partisan units throughout Europe range from        to               In the occupied Polish and Soviet territories  thousands of Jews fled into the swamps or forests and joined the partisans       although the partisan movements did not always welcome them       An estimated        to        joined the Soviet partisan movement       One of the famous Jewish groups was the Bielski partisans in Belarus  led by the Bielski brothers       Jews also joined Polish forces  including the Home Army  According to Timothy Snyder   more Jews fought in the Warsaw Uprising of August      than in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April             ab   Polish

exile in London learned about Auschwitz from the Polish leadership in Warsaw  who from late       received a continual flow of information  about the camp  according to historian Michael Fleming       This was in large measure thanks to Captain Witold Pilecki of the Polish Home Army  who allowed himself to be arrested in September      and sent there  An inmate until he escaped in April       his mission was to set up a resistance movement  ZOW   prepare to take over the camp  and smuggle out information about it       On   January       the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs  Vyacheslav Molotov  sent out diplomatic notes about German atrocities  The notes were based on reports about mass graves and bodies surfacing from pits and quarries in areas the Red Army had liberated  as well as witness reports from German occupied areas       The following month  Szlama Ber Winer escaped from the Che mno concentration camp in Poland and passed information about it to the Oneg Shabbat

smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto twice       By late July or early August       Polish leaders in Warsaw had learned about the mass killing of Jews in Auschwitz  according to Fleming       ac  The Polish Interior Ministry prepared a report  Sprawozdanie            which said at the end   There are different methods of execution  People are shot by firing squads  killed by an  air hammer   Hammerluft   and poisoned by gas in special gas chambers  Prisoners condemned to death by the Gestapo are murdered by the first two methods  The third method  the gas chamber  is employed for those who are ill or incapable of work and those who have been brought in transports especially for the purpose  Soviet prisoners of war  and  recently Jews         The Mass Extermination of Jews in German

November       where it was translated into English and added to another   Report on Conditions in Poland   dated    November  Fleming writes that the latter was sent to the Polish Embassy in the United States       On    December       the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister  Edward Raczy ski  addressed the fledgling United Nations on the killings  the address was distributed with the title The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland  He told them about the use of poison gas  about Treblinka  Be  ec and Sobib r  that the Polish underground had referred to them as extermination

the intelligence they had received  A BBC Hungarian Service memo  written by Carlile Macartney  a BBC broadcaster and senior Foreign Office adviser on Hungary  stated in        We shouldn t mention the Jews at all   The British government s view was that the Hungarian people s antisemitism would make them distrust the Allies if their broadcasts focused on the Jews       The US government similarly feared turning the war into one about the Jews  antisemitism and isolationism were common in the US before its entry into the war       Although governments and the German public appear to have understood what was happening  it seems the Jews themselves did not  According to Saul Friedl nder    t estimonies left by Jews from all over occupied Europe indicate that  in contradistinction to vast segments of surrounding society  the victims did not understand what was ultimately in store for them   In Western Europe  he writes  Jewish communities seem to have failed to piece the

     but Nazi leaders rated ideological imperatives above economic considerations       By      it was evident to the armed forces leadership that Germany was losing the war       The mass murder continued nevertheless  reaching a  frenetic  pace in           when Auschwitz gassed nearly         people       On    March       Hitler ordered the military occupation of Hungary and dispatched Adolf Eichmann to Budapest to supervise the deportation of the country s Jews       From    March Jews were required to wear the yellow star  were forbidden from owning cars  bicycles  radios or telephones  and were later forced into ghettos       Between    May and   July          Jews were deported from Hungary to Auschwitz II Birkenau  almost all sent directly to the gas chambers  ad  A

political class became the target of a campaign of murder  Intelligenzaktion and AB Aktion        Between     and     million non Jewish Polish citizens were killed by Germans during the war  about four fifths were ethnic Poles and the rest Ukrainians and Belarusians       At least         died in concentration camps  around         in Auschwitz  Others died in massacres or in uprisings such as

Bevolkerungsbiologische Forschungsstelle called them  a peculiar form of the human species who are incapable of development and came about by mutation        In May      they were placed under similar laws to the Jews  and in December Himmler ordered that they be sent to Auschwitz  unless they had served in the Wehrmacht       He adjusted the order on    November      to allow  sedentary Gypsies and part Gypsies  in the occupied Soviet areas to be viewed as citizens       In Belgium  France and the Netherlands  the Roma were subject to restrictions on movement and confinement to collection

triggered the Historikerstreit in June      with an article in the conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung   The past that will not pass  A speech that could be written but no longer delivered             ai  The Nazi era was suspended like a sword over Germany s present  he wrote  rather than being studied as a historical event  He compared  the guilt of the Germans  to the Nazi idea of  the guilt of the Jews   and argued that the focus on the Final Solution overlooked the Nazi s euthanasia program and treatment of Soviet POWs  as well as post war issues such as the Vietnam War and Soviet Afghan War  Comparing Auschwitz to the Gulag  he suggested that the Holocaust was a response to Hitler s fear of the Soviet Union   Did the Gulag Archipelago not precede Auschwitz  Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual prius of the  racial murder  of National Socialism      Was Auschwitz perhaps rooted in a past that would not pass   aj    Hall of Names  Yad Vashem  Jerusalem       Nolte s arguments were viewed as an attempt to normalize the Holocaust  one of the debate s key questions  according to historian Ernst Piper  was whether history should  historicize  or  moralize        ak  In September      in Die Zeit  Eberhard J ckel responded that  never before had a state  with the authority of its leader  decided and announced that a specific group of humans  including the elderly  women  children and infants  would be killed as quickly as possible  then carried out this resolution using every possible means of state power   i  Despite the criticism of Nolte  the Historikerstreit put  the question of comparison  on the agenda  according to Dan Stone in            He argued that the idea of the Holocaust as unique was overtaken by attempts to place it within the context of Stalinism  ethnic cleansing  and the Nazis  intentions for post war  demographic reordering   particularly the Generalplan Ost  the plan to kill tens of millions of Slavs to create living space for Germans       J ckel s position continued nevertheless to inform the views of many specialists  Richard J  Evans argued in        Thus although the Nazi  Final Solution  was one genocide among many  it had features that made it stand out from all the rest as well  Unlike all the others it was bounded neither by space nor by time  It was launched not against a local or regional obstacle  but at a world enemy seen as operating on a global scale  It was bound to an even larger plan of racial reordering and reconstruction involving further genocidal killing on an almost unimaginable scale  aimed  however  at clearing the way in a particular region   Eastern Europe   for a further struggle against the Jews and those the Nazis regarded as their puppets  It was set in motion by ideologues who saw world history in racial terms  It was  in part  carried out by industrial methods  These things all make it unique    Richard Evans   Was the

 a b Dan Stone  Histories of the Holocaust          Europe s Romany  Gypsy  population was also the victim of genocide under the Nazis  Many other population groups  notably Poles  Ukrainians  and Soviet prisoners of war were killed in huge numbers  and smaller groups such as Jehovah s Witnesses  Black Germans  and homosexuals suffered terribly under Nazi rule  The evidence suggests that the Slav nations of Europe were also destined  had Germany won the war  to become victims of systematic mass murder  and even the terrible brutality of the occupation in eastern Europe  especially in Poland  can be understood as genocidal     Part of the reason for today s understanding  though  is a correct assessment of the fact that for the Nazis the Jews were regarded in a kind of  metaphysical  way  they were not just considered as racially inferior  like Romanies   deviants  like homosexuals  or enemy nationals standing in the way of German colonial expression  like Slavs        T he Jews were to some extent outside of the racial scheme as defined by racial philosophers and anthropologists  They were not mere Untermenschen  sub humans      but were regarded as a Gegenrasse

Holocaust          There was no greater symbol of the degenerate modernity that Nazism rejected than  the Jew   especially  the international Jew   the supposed string puller behind the British and American democracies as well as the communist USSR     the Jews  rootless cosmopolitans   in the communist parlance were quick to be targeted     The Holocaust  then  was a transitional phenomenon  not just because Jews lived everywhere in Europe but because many European states     took upon themselves the task of solving the Jewish question     One could talk of a transnational Holocaust  but a more appropriate term would be Holocausts      As Marrus noted of western Europe  The Holocaust in History        p        the Nazis relied on local agencies to prepare the Jews for their own destruction  Remarkably few Germans were available for such work   In eastern Europe too  the Nazis  task would have been considerably harder were it not for local assistance          The full extent

be traced back to a fundamental confusion over means and ends  Were Jews to be expelled  placed in ghettos  or put to death  Until October       the hope was that Jews would be expelled into Siberia

carried out by Einsatzgruppe C in the Ukraine  In Lvov  Lemberg   where the NKVD  the Soviet People s Commissariat for Internal Affairs  had shot some       prisoners at the end of June and bloodily suppressed an attempted uprising by the OUN  pogroms were started by the indigenous population on    June  the day of the city s occupation by German troops  They were probably initiated by the OUN and its militia  It is likely  however  that a special unit of the Wehrmacht played a key role in triggering this pogrom when it entered the city as an advance guard together with a battalion of Ukrainian nationalists under its command  The pogroms cost at least       lives and were finally ended by the Wehrmacht on   July after it had spent two days observing but not intervening  At that point  however  Einsatzgruppe C took over the organization of murderous activities  over the next few days  by way of  retribution  for the murders committed by the NKVD  three Einsatzgruppe C commandos that had entered the city murdered       to       Jews  At the end of July  Ukrainian groups took back the initiative and were responsible for a further pogrom for which support from the German Special Purposes Commando was probably decisive once again  During the so called  Petljura Days  more than       Jews were murdered in Lviv           A long debate about the Jedwabne pogrom was triggered in      by the publication of Jan T  Gross s book Neighbors  The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne  Poland          Ten days after the invasion  Reinhard Heydrich laid out  in a memorandum  the guidelines he had issued to the Einsatzgruppen   All the following are to be executed  Officials of the Comintern  together with professional Communist politicians in general  top

elements     On the contrary  these are to be secretly encouraged   Cesarani writes that it is  noteworthy that Heyrich did not want the SS to be held responsible           Nikolaus Wachsmann          The genesis of the Holocaust was lengthy and complex  The days are long gone when historians believed that it could be reduced to a single decision taken on a single day by Hitler  Instead  the Holocaust was the culmination of a dynamic murderous process  propelled by increasingly radical initiatives from above and below  During World War II  the Nazi pursuit of a Final Solution moved from increasingly lethal plans for Jewish  reservations  to immediate extermination  There were several key periods of radicalization  The invasion of the Soviet Union in June      marked one such moment  as mass shootings of Jewish men of military age soon grew into widespread ethnic cleansing  with daily bloodbaths of women  children  and the elderly            U  odbilo  idom  Najpr snej ie rasov  z

the camp was well aware of what was happening to the Jews  and in a report dated   July      advised that from June      Soviet prisoners of war were taken straight from trains to the gas chambers  This report also noted that through      around        Jewish men and        Jewish women and children had arrived at O wi cim  most of whom including all the children were gassed immediately  The

Holocaust  The figure commonly used is the six million quoted by Adolf Eichmann  a senior SS official  All the serious research confirms that the number of victims was between five and six million  Early calculations range from     million  Professor Raul Hilberg  to      million  Jacob Leschinsky   More recent research  by Professor Yisrael Gutman and Dr  Robert Rozett in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust  estimates the Jewish losses at           million  and a study headed by Dr  Wolfgang Benz presents a range from      million to six million  The main sources for these statistics are comparisons of prewar censuses with postwar censuses and population estimates  Nazi documentation containing partial data on various deportations and murders is also used  We estimate that Yad Vashem currently has somewhat more than     million names of victims that are accessible           Robert Ley committed suicide in prison and Gustav Krupp was judged unfit for trial          The debate was
