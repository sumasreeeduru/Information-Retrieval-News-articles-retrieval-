       Semantic Scholar  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Search service for journal articles Semantic ScholarType of siteSearch engineCreated byAllen Institute for Artificial IntelligenceURLsemanticscholar orgLaunchedNovember                Semantic Scholar is a project developed at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence  Publicly released in November       it is designed to be an AI backed search engine for academic publications     The project uses a combination of machine learning  natural language processing  and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis  and to extract relevant figures  entities  and venues from papers     In comparison to Google Scholar and PubMed  Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential papers  and to identify the connections between them  As of January       following a      project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries  the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than    million papers from computer science and biomedicine     In March       Doug Raymond  who developed machine learning initiatives for the Amazon Alexa platform  was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project     As of August       the number of included papers had grown to more than     million    after the addition of the Microsoft Academic Graph records     Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID  or S CID for short   for example  Liu  Ying  Gayle  Albert A  Wilder Smith  Annelies  Rockl v  Joacim  March         The reproductive number of COVID    is higher compared to SARS coronavirus   Journal of Travel Medicine          S CID
