a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage  connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds  In addition to it lying beside Lake Michigan  two rivers the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side flow either entirely or partially through the city          Chicago s history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan  While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region s waterborne cargo  today s huge lake freighters use the city s Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side  The lake also provides another positive effect  moderating Chicago s climate  making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer         A satellite image of Chicago When Chicago was founded in       most of the early building was around the mouth of the Chicago River  as can be seen on a map of the city s original    blocks       The overall grade of the city s central  built up areas is

arterial streets in outlying sections  As new additions to the city were platted  city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction  about one street per     meters in one direction and one street per     meters in the other direction   The grid s regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property  A scattering of diagonal streets  many of them originally Native American trails  also cross the city  Elston  Milwaukee  Ogden  Lincoln  etc    Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago  but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed       In       Chicago was ranked the sixth most walkable large city in the United States       Many of

normal summer  temperatures reach at least     F      C  on as many as    days  with lakefront locations staying cooler when winds blow off the lake  Winters are relatively cold and snowy  although the city typically sees less snow and rain in winter than that experienced in the eastern Great Lakes region  blizzards do occur  as in            There are many sunny but cold days in winter  The normal winter high from December through March is about     F     C   with January and February being the coldest months  a polar vortex in January      nearly broke the city s cold record of      F

history of Chicago During much of the last half of the   th century  Chicago s politics were dominated by a growing Democratic Party organization  During the     s and     s  Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist  anarchist and labor organizations       For much of the   th century  Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States  with Chicago s Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been  solid blue  in presidential elections since       Even before then  it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois  only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago  The citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since       when William Thompson was voted into office  The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics  where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago s public school funding  Chicago contains less than     of the state s population  but it is split between eight of Illinois     districts in the United States House of Representatives  All eight of the city s representatives are Democrats  only two Republicans have represented a significant portion of the city since       for one term each  Robert P  Hanrahan from      to       and Michael Patrick Flanagan from      to       Machine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U S  cities       During much of that time  the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal  independent  faction of the Democratic Party  The independents finally gained control of city government in      with the election of Harold Washington  in office             From      until May           Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor  Richard M  Daley  the son of Richard J  Daley  Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago  the Democratic primary vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U S  House and Illinois State seats  The aldermanic  mayoral  and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed  Formerly a state legislator representing

government workers to be  diminished or impaired   In this particular case  the fact that the workers  agreements had expiration dates let the city of Chicago set an expiration date of      for
