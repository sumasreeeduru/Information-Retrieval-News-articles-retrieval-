is a mobile app and news aggregator developed by Apple Inc   for its iOS  iPadOS  watchOS  and macOS operating systems  The iOS version was launched with the release of iOS    It is the successor to the Newsstand app included in previous versions of iOS  Users can read news articles with it  based on publishers  websites and topics they select  such as CNN  technology or politics      Contents    History   App   Apple News    See also   References   External links   History edit  The app was announced at Apple s WWDC      developer conference  It was released alongside the iOS   release on September           for the iPhone  iPod Touch and iPad  At launch  the app was only available to users in the United States  but within a month had become available to users in Australia and the United Kingdom     It was reported in      that Apple Inc  had acquired the Netherlands based digital magazine company Prss  developers of an application that simplified the creation of iPad compatible magazines using a WYSIWYG editor that didn t require any knowledge of code     Prss was seen as a magazine version of iBooks Author  The idea for Prss came after entrepreneur Michel Elings and longtime travel writer and photographer Jochem Wijnands designed their own iPad publication called TRVL  The Prss invention became what is now  Apple News      During the keynote address at WWDC       it was revealed that with the forthcoming iOS    update the News app will undergo new icon and app redesigns along with an improved For You section organized by topics  Furthermore  it was announced that there would be support for paid subscriptions for certain news sources and publishers as well as an opt in system for breaking news notifications and email on top news stories  During the      WWDC  Apple announced that the Apple News app would be ported to macOS and be available to users in Australia  United Kingdom  and United States starting in macOS           The app is installed by default in every region but is not made visible to users outside those three regions  Users can still open it using various workarounds     In February      Digiday reported that publishers are frustrated over the platform s lack of revenue      despite seeing steady growth in audience over the past year  In March      Apple added support for Canada  and added a paid subscription version       App edit  The Apple News app works by pulling in news stories from the web through various syndication feeds  Atom and RSS      or from news publishing partners through the JSON descriptive Apple News Format      Any news publisher can submit their content for inclusion in Apple News  and users can add any feed through the Safari web browser  Stories added through Safari will be displayed via the in app web browser included with the app  News is fetched from publisher s websites through the AppleBot web crawler bot      The bot fetches feeds  as well as web pages and images for the Apple News service  It has received criticism for being poorly behaved and not being fault tolerant  resulting in high loads on websites      The Apple News version distributed with iOS   made it hard to differentiate traffic originating from within the app from traffic originating from other apps  Apple News version    introduced in iOS     began identifying itself using its own User Agent string  making it possible to measure the reach of Apple News using web analytics solutions      Traffic analytics was previously only available to paying publisher partners through iAds  In WWDC       Apple announced that the News app would be available in macOS Mojave  On March           iOS      was released with the updated News app that introduced subscriptions through Apple s  Apple News   service  which was announced on the same day       The icon for Apple News also changed  putting the N in the icon front and center with a slightly changed design       Apple News  edit  On March           Apple announced Apple News   a subscription based service allowing access to content from over     magazines  as well as selected newspapers      The service was preceded by the digital media subscription app Texture  which Apple acquired in           The Wall Street Journal  one of the newspapers available through Apple News   will reconfigure its services to offer more articles for casual readers  It will not actively display business intensive articles through the Apple platform  though they will still be available by searching through a three day archive      On September           Apple announced that Apple News  will be bundled in the Premier package of Apple One alongside iCloud  Apple Music  Apple Arcade  and Apple Fitness        See also edit  Google
