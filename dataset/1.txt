References   Etymology edit  Bidda is derived from the Arabic word badaa  meaning  to invent   When the previously uninhabited area first became populated  a settlement was essentially invented  giving it its name      History edit    Trigonometrical plan of the harbour of El Biddah on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf         The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in       by the Carmelite Convent  in an account which chronicles several settlements in Qatar  In the record  the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are alluded to        th century edit  Al Bidda became the most important town in the country after the decline of Zubarah in the early nineteenth century  Doha  the present day capital  developed from Al Bidda     David Seaton  a British political resident in Muscat  detailed one of the earliest English accounts of Al Bidda in         Account by David Seaton     Bedih  sic  is Situated in       N  Lat  and is a large open bay full of Coral banks with very unequal soundings from twelve to three fathoms  the land is low and sandy  hardly to be seen at the distance of ten Miles  on a nearer approach  it seems gradually rising from both extremes towards the centre  where it forms a ridge at the distance of half a Mile from the Shore  under this ridge near the sea  are two hillocks and a Valley between them  off each of the hillocks runs a Shoal with half a  fathom at high water and between them a Channel with one and a half fathoms  and at the distance of a Mile and a half three fathoms  on the Northern hillock is a  fortified House with a Wall and Square tower  in the Valley a breast Work with two Guns  and on the southern hillock two large huts with some kind of defence  and half a Mile to the Southward near the ridge is another Square building with a flag staff  under the Northern hillock is a sandy beach on which two Buglas  one Dow   one Botella were drawn up with a breast work of Stones  the only direct landing  place is in the mouth of the Valley  but it would be attended with great loss without ships to drive the Enemy away as it is flanked by the breast work and boats  in which were a number of Men and ten Guns  and fronted by the two Guns in the Valley  about two Miles to the South is a Sandy beach without cover for the Enemy s snipers  but the Square building with the flagstaff must be stormed before the hillocks can be got at      In January       political resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with the ruler and initial founder of Doha  Buhur bin Jubrun  who was also the chief of the Al Buainain tribe        MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time  Following the founding of Doha  written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the extremely close proximity of the two settlements     Later that year  Lt  Guy and Lt  Brucks mapped and wrote a description of the two settlements  Despite being mapped as two separate entities  they were referred to under the collective name of Al Bidda in the written description           An      map of Bahrain and present day Qatar which depicts Al Bidda  In       Al Bidda was demolished by the sheikh of Bahrain and its inhabitants were removed to Bahrain      The sheikh also placed economic blockade over the town in           In       a large number of ships and troops were sent from Bahrain to punish the people of Al Wakrah and Al Bidda  Abu Dhabi joined on Bahrain s behalf due to the conception that Al Wakrah served as a refuge for fugitives from Oman  Later that year  the combined forces sacked the two aforementioned Qatari cities with       men in what would come to be known as the Qatari Bahraini War          A British record later stated  that the towns of Doha and Wakrah were  at the end of      temporarily blotted out of existence  the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported   Around early       the town became a base of operations for Bedouins resisting Ottoman rule after they established a foothold in Eastern Arabia that year      By December       emir Jassim bin Mohammed authorized the Ottomans to send     troops and equipment to Al Bidda      Shortly after  Qatar was assimilated as a province in the Ottoman Empire  and Al Bidda was recognized as the official provincial capital      Al Bidda Fort served as the final stronghold for Ottoman troops in the      Battle of Al Wajbah  They surrendered after Jassim bin Mohammed s troops cut off the town s water supply and besieged the fortress      An Ottoman report compiled the same year reported that Al Bidda and Doha had a combined population of       inhabitants  jointly referring to both towns by the name of  Katar   Al Bidda was classified as the western section of Katar  and was stated to have mainly accommodated members of the Al Kuwari and Soudan tribes             th century edit  In J G  Lorimer s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf first published in       he describes Al Bidda as a large town which is a natural harbor due to its reefs  but states that vessels of more than    feet draft cannot pass  The land is described as stony desert which is    or    feet above sea level  The majority of its inhabitants  who were said to be involved in pearl fishing  were composed of Qatari tribes  such as the Al Soudan  Bahraini shopkeepers and immigrants
