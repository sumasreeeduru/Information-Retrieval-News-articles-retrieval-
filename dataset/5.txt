territory of present day Iran was home to several civilizations  including Elam  Jiroft  and Zayanderud  Elam  the most prominent of these civilizations  developed in the southwest alongside those in

from three centuries of Assyrian rule      The unification of the Median tribes under king Deioces in     BC led to the foundation of the Median Empire which  by     BC  controlled almost the entire territory of present day Iran and eastern Anatolia      This marked the end of the Kingdom of Urartu as well  which was subsequently conquered and dissolved            Tomb of Cyrus the Great  founder

conquest of Media was a result of what is called the Persian Revolt  The brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the Median ruler Astyages  and was quickly spread to other provinces  as they allied with the Persians  Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia  Babylon  Egypt  parts of the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper  as well as the lands to the west of the Indus and Oxus rivers      BC was the year in which Persian forces defeated the Babylonian army at Opis  and marked the end of around four centuries of Mesopotamian domination of

Muslim                 In their struggle for power  the society in their times gradually became cosmopolitan and the old Arab simplicity and aristocratic dignity  bearing and prestige were lost  Persians and Turks began to replace the Arabs in most fields  The fusion of the Arab nobility with the subject races  the practice of polygamy and concubinage  made for a social amalgam wherein loyalties became uncertain and a hierarchy of officials emerged  a bureaucracy at first Persian and later Turkish which decreased Abbasid prestige and power for good       After two centuries of Arab

Arab elements within the army       As a result  the Mamluks gained a significant political power  In      large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids  whose rulers were of mamluk Turkic origin  and longer subsequently under the Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires       The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia  while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them            The result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko Persian tradition  From      to       under the Khwarazmian Empire  Iran suffered a devastating invasion by the Mongol army of Genghis Khan  According to Steven R  Ward   Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau  possibly    to    million people  Some historians have estimated that Iran s population did not again reach its pre Mongol levels until the mid   th century

identity within large parts of Greater Iran       Iran was predominantly Sunni       but Ismail instigated a forced conversion to the Shia branch of Islam       spreading throughout the Safavid territories in the Caucasus  Iran  Anatolia  and Mesopotamia  As a result  modern day Iran is the only official Shia nation of the world  with it holding an absolute majority in Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan  having there the first and the second highest number of Shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world            Meanwhile  the centuries long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire led to numerous Ottoman Iranian wars         A portrait of Abbas I  the powerful  pragmatic Safavid ruler who reinforced Iran s military

western Eurasia  The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran  as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran  playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards  Following a gradual decline in the late     s and the early     s  which was caused by internal conflicts  the continuous wars
