to its large population it has a small area at just     square kilometers  Located along the Tigris  near the ruins of the Akkadian city of Babylon and the ancient Iranian capital of Ctesiphon  Baghdad was founded in the  th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate  Within a short time  Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural  commercial  and intellectual center of the Muslim world  This  in addition to housing several key academic institutions  including the House of Wisdom  as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment  garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the  Centre of Learning   Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the Islamic Golden Age  peaking at a population of more than a million     The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in       resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires  With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state  formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia  in       Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arabic culture  with a population variously estimated at   or over   million  note    In contemporary times  the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage  most recently due to the United States led       invasion of Iraq  and the subsequent Iraq War that lasted until December       In recent years  the city has been frequently subjected to insurgent attacks  resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts as well  As of      update   Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places to live  ranked by Mercer as the world s worst major city for quality

disputed     The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia  By the  th century AD  several villages had developed there  including a Persian         hamlet called Baghdad  the name which would come to be used for the Abbasid metropolis      Arab authors  realizing the pre Islamic origins of Baghdad s name  generally looked for its roots in Middle Persian     They suggested various meanings  the most common of which was  bestowed by God      Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology     which views the word as a compound of bagh     god  and d d     given           In Old Persian the first element can be traced to boghu and is related to Slavic bog  god          A similar term in Middle Persian is the name Mithrad t  Mihrd d in New Persian   known in English by its Hellenistic form Mithridates  meaning  Given by Mithra   d t is the more archaic form of d d  related to Latin dat and English donor      There are a number of other locations in the wider region whose names are compounds of the word bagh  including Baghlan and Bagram in Afghanistan  Baghshan in Iran      and Baghdati in Georgia  which likely share the same etymological origins          A few authors have suggested older origins for the name  in particular the name Bagdadu or Hudadu that existed in Old Babylonian  spelled with a sign that can represent both bag and hu   and the Babylonian Talmudic name of a place called  Baghdatha              Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations     When the Abbasid caliph  Al Mansur  founded a completely new city for his capital  he chose the name Madinat al Salaam or City of Peace  This was the official name on coins  weights  and other official usage  although the common people continued to use the old name          unreliable source   By the   th century   Baghdad  became almost the exclusive name for the world renowned metropolis   History edit  Main articles  History of Baghdad and Timeline of Baghdad Foundation edit   A view of Baghdad from the print collection in Travels in Asia and Africa  etc   ed  J  P  Berjew  British Library  After the fall of the Umayyads  the first Muslim dynasty  the victorious Abbasid rulers wanted their own capital from which they could rule  They chose a site north of the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon  and on    July         the caliph Al Mansur commissioned the construction of the city  It was built under the supervision of the Barmakids      Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the Abbasids  The Muslim historian al Tabari reported an ancient prediction by Christian monks that a lord named Miklas would one day build a spectacular city around the area of Baghdad  When Mansur heard the story  he became very joyful  for legend has it  he was called Miklas as a child      Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying   This is indeed the city that I am to found  where I am to live  and where my descendants will reign afterward       The city s growth was helped by its excellent location  based on at least two factors  it had control over strategic and trading routes along the Tigris  and it had an abundance of water in a dry climate  Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city  allowing all households to have a plentiful supply  which was very uncommon during this time  The city of Baghdad soon became so large that it had to be divided into three judicial districts  Madinat al Mansur  the Round City   al Sharqiyya  Karkh  and Askar al Mahdi  on the West Bank       Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon  the capital of the Sassanians  which was located some    km     mi  to the southeast  Today  all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of Salman Pak  just to the south of Greater Baghdad  Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed Seleucia  the first capital of the Seleucid Empire  which had earlier replaced the city of Babylon  According to the traveler Ibn Battuta  Baghdad was one of the largest cities  not including the damage it has received  The residents are mostly Hanbal  Baghdad is also home to the grave of Abu Hanifa where there is a cell and a mosque above it  The Sultan of Baghdad  Abu Said Bahadur Khan  was a Tatar king who embraced Islam      In its early years  the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the Qur an  when it refers to Paradise      It took four years to build            Mansur assembled engineers  surveyors  and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city  Over         construction workers came to survey the plans  many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city      July was chosen as the starting time because two astrologers  Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah  believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion  Leo      Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity  pride  and expansion  The bricks used to make the city were    inches      mm  on all four sides  Abu Hanifah was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal  which brought water to the work site for both human consumption and the manufacture of the bricks  Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city  and marble steps led down to the river s edge    The Round city of Baghdad between     and     AD This article may be confusing or unclear to readers  In particular  The city can t be both    km and   km wide  It s also unclear what a  framework  is in this context   Please help us clarify the article  There might be a discussion about this on the talk page   March        Learn how and when to remove this template message  The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about    km     mi  in diameter  The city was designed as a circle about   km      mi  in diameter  leading it to be known as the  Round City   The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls  but the final construction added another ring inside the first      Within the city there were many parks  gardens  villas  and promenades      There was a large sanitation department  many fountains and public baths  and unlike contemporary European cities at the time  streets were frequently washed free of debris and trash      In fact  by the time of Harun al Rashid  Baghdad had a few thousand hammams  These baths increased public hygiene and served as a way for the religious to perform ablutions as prescribed by Islam  Moreover  entry fees were usually so low that almost everyone could afford them      In the center of the city lay the mosque  as well as headquarters for guards  The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown  The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Persian Sasanian urban design  The Sasanian city of Gur in Fars  built     years before Baghdad  is nearly identical in its general circular design  radiating avenues  and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city  This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient Greek and Roman urban planning  in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles  Baghdad was a busy city during the day and had many attractions at night  There were cabarets and taverns  halls for backgammon and chess  live plays  concerts  and acrobats  On street corners  storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights       Surrounding walls See also  Gates of Baghdad The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named Kufa  Basra  Khurasan  and Syria  named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations  The distance between these gates was a little less than     km      mi   Each gate had double doors that were made of iron  the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them  The wall itself was about    m thick at the base and about    m thick at the top  Also  the wall was    m high  which included merlons  a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by embrasures  This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of    m  The second wall had towers and rounded merlons  which surrounded the towers  This outer wall was protected by a solid glacis  which is made out of bricks and quicklime  Beyond the outer wall was a water filled moat  citation needed   Golden Gate Palace The Golden Gate Palace  the residence of the caliph and his family  was in the middle of Baghdad  in the central square  In the central part of the building  there was a green dome that was    m high  Surrounding the palace was an esplanade  a waterside building  in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback  In addition  the palace was near other mansions and officer s residences  Near the Gate of Syria  a building served as the home for the guards  It was made of brick and marble  The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front  In      after the death of caliph Al Amin  the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family      The roundness points to the fact that it was based on Arabic script          The two designers who were hired by Al Mansur to plan the city s design were Naubakht  a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious  and Mashallah  a Jew from Khorasan  Iran       Center of learning   th to  th centuries  edit  Further information  Islamic Golden Age  Courtyard of Mustansiriya madrasa  established by Al Mustansir in      Within a generation of its founding  Baghdad became a hub of learning and commerce  The city flourished into an unrivaled intellectual center of science  medicine  philosophy  and education  especially with the Abbasid Translation Movement began under the second caliph Al Mansur and thrived under the seventh caliph Al Ma mun      Baytul Hikmah or the  House of Wisdom  was among the most well known academies      and had the largest selection of books in the world by the middle of the  th century  citation needed  Notable scholars based in Baghdad during this time include translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq  mathematician al Khwarizmi  and philosopher Al Kindi      Although Arabic was used as the international language of science  the scholarship involved not only Arabs  but also Persians  Syriacs      Nestorians  Jews  Arab Christians          and people from other ethnic and religious groups native to the region                      These are considered among the fundamental elements that contributed to the flourishing of scholarship in the Medieval Islamic world              Baghdad was also a significant center of Islamic religious learning  with Al Jahiz contributing to the formation of Mu tazili theology  as well as Al Tabari culminating the scholarship on the Quranic exegesis      Baghdad was likely the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation until the    s  when it tied with C rdoba      Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak      Many of the One Thousand and One Nights tales  widely known as the Arabian Nights  are set in Baghdad during this period  It would surpass even Constantinople in prosperity and size      Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries  Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature  Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature  the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale  Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends  but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi public character      Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period  The earliest was that of the famous Al Ma mun  who was caliph from     to      Another was established by Sabur ibn Ardashir in     or     for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy      Unfortunately  this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established  This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society      The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries  The Nezamiyeh was founded by the Persian Nizam al Mulk  who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans      It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in       The Mustansiriyah madrasa  which owned an exceedingly rich library  was founded by Al Mustansir  the second last Abbasid caliph  who died in           This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad   Stagnation and invasions    th to   th centuries  edit   Al Khulafa mosque retains

meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate  including relocations of the capital to Samarra  during         and           the loss of the western and easternmost provinces  and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids            and Seljuk Turks              The Seljuks were a clan of the Oghuz Turks from Central Asia that converted to the Sunni branch of Islam  In       they destroyed the Ghaznavids  taking over their land and in       Tughril Beg  the leader of the Seljuks  took over Baghdad  The Seljuks expelled the Buyid dynasty of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad  They ruled as Sultans in the name of the Abbasid caliphs  they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime   Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs      Sieges and wars in which Baghdad was involved are listed below   Siege of Baghdad            Fourth Fitna  Caliphal Civil War  Siege of Baghdad

al Basasiri  an adherent of the Ismailis along with the  Uqaylid Quraysh      Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad  al Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam Caliph al Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam s behalf  It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da i  al Mu ayyad al Shirazi  had a direct role in supporting al Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Maw il  W sit and Kufa  Soon after      by December       a Shi i adh n  call to prayer  was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah  sermon  was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam Caliph      Despite his Shi i inclinations  Al Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi is alike  for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor        Conquest of Baghdad by the Mongols in      CE On    February       Baghdad was captured by the Mongols led by Hulegu  a grandson of Chingiz Khan  Genghis Khan   during the siege of Baghdad      Many quarters were ruined by fire  siege  or looting  The Mongols massacred most of the city s inhabitants  including the caliph Al Musta sim  and destroyed large sections of the city  The canals and dykes forming the city s irrigation system were also destroyed  During this time  in Baghdad  Christians and Shia were tolerated  while Sunnis were treated as enemies      The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate      It has been argued that this marked an end to the Islamic Golden Age and served a blow from which Islamic civilisation never fully recovered        Central Asian Turko Mongol conqueror Timur sacked the city and spared almost no one At this point  Baghdad was ruled by the Ilkhanate  a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire  ruling from Iran  In August       Baghdad was occupied by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror Timur   Tamerlane        by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz  Sultan Ahmad Jalayir fled to Syria  where the Mamluk Sultan Barquq protected him and killed Timur s envoys  Timur left the Sarbadar prince Khwaja Mas ud to govern Baghdad  but he was driven out when Ahmad Jalayir returned  In       Baghdad was again sacked  by Timur      When his forces took Baghdad  he spared almost no one  and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads      Baghdad became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol Jalayirid

of the plague and cholera      and sometimes two thirds of its population has been wiped out      For a time  Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East  The city saw relative revival in the

April       the U S  controlled Coalition Provisional Authority  CPA  began the process of creating new functions for these  The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods  elected by neighbourhood caucuses  The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government  to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends  relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings  Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them  Once all     later increased to     neighbourhood councils were in place  each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city s nine district councils  The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood

government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood  through the district  and up to the city council  The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself  There  local councils were elected from    neighbourhoods  Nahia  and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils  Qada   As within the city  the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the    member Baghdad Regional Council  The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council  As before  the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent  The    member Provincial Council took office in February      and served until national elections held in January       when a new Provincial Council was elected  This system of     separate councils may seem overly cumbersome  however  Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people  At the lowest level  the neighbourhood councils  each council represents an average of        people  The nine District Advisory Councils  DAC  are as follows       Adhamiyah Karkh  Green Zone      Karrada         Kadhimiya     Mansour Sadr City  Thawra      Al Rashid     Rusafa New Baghdad  Tisaa Nissan
