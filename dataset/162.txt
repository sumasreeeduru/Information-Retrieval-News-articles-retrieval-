by Arab navigations and Bantu speaking agriculturalists     while ceramic finds from the  th to   th century demonstrate that the Islands were part of the developing Swahili civilization        but when Moroni itself was first settled is not known  By the middle of the second millennium  however  Moroni was clearly a well established town  engaged in trade networks throughout the Indian Ocean  and the Badjanani mosque  built in       is a testament to the city s wealth  contemporary with the golden ages of other Swahili cities     Together with neighbouring port and royal capital Ikoni  Moroni was one of two centres of economic and political power of the kingdom of Bambao  Nevertheless  until the end of the nineteenth century it was just one of a number of large towns on the island  and it wasn t until the Sultan of Bambao  Said Ali ibn Said Omar  negotiated a treaty of Protectorate with France in      that his town became the seat of the colonial administration     Moroni grew slowly through the twentieth century for  although it was now the capital of Ngazidja  it was not the seat of the territorial administration  which was located at Dzaoudzi on Mayotte  and in      its population was still only          However  in that same year the decision was taken to move the capital of the archipelago from Dzaoudzi to Moroni  and the town slowly grew to become the largest in the country  An agreement on broad autonomy to the three islands was refused by the Anjouan representatives which resulted in an eruption of violence affecting Moroni in April       citation needed
