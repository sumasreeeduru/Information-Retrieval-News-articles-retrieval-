imports or exports  It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade  In government  free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism              the opposite of free trade  Most nations are today members of the World Trade Organization multilateral trade agreements  Free trade was best exemplified by the unilateral stance of Great Britain who reduced regulations and duties on imports and exports from the mid nineteenth century to the     s     An alternative approach  of creating free trade areas between groups of countries by agreement  such as that of the European Economic Area and the Mercosur open markets  creates a protectionist barrier between that free trade area and the rest of the world  Most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment  such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports  Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources  Other barriers that may hinder trade include import quotas  taxes and non tariff barriers  such as regulatory legislation  Historically  openness to free trade substantially increased from      to the outbreak of World War I  Trade openness increased again during the     s  but collapsed  in particular in Europe and North America  during the Great Depression  Trade openness increased substantially again from the     s onwards  albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the     s   Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been           There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth                        and economic stability      However  liberalization of trade can cause significant and unequally distributed losses  and the economic dislocation of workers in import competing sectors

without taxes  including tariffs  or other trade barriers  e g  quotas on imports or subsidies for producers   Trade in services without taxes or other trade barriers  The absence of  trade distorting  policies  such as taxes  subsidies  regulations  or laws  that give some firms  households  or factors of production an advantage over others  Unregulated access to markets  Unregulated access to market information  Inability of firms to distort markets through government imposed monopoly or oligopoly power  Trade agreements which encourage free trade  Economics edit  Economic models edit  Further information  Supply and demand Two simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through David Ricardo s theory of comparative advantage and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota  An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade          Most economists would recommend that even developing nations should set their tariff rates quite low  but the economist Ha Joon Chang  a proponent of industrial policy  believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development  Underdeveloped nations today  Chang believes  are weak players in a much more competitive system          Counterarguments to Chang s point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the   th century  If the chief justification for a tariff is to stimulate infant industries  it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful  This theory  known as import substitution industrialization  is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations       Tariffs edit   The pink regions are the net loss to society caused by the existence of the tariff The chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good  Prior to the tariff  the price of the good in the world market  and hence in the domestic market  is Pworld  The tariff increases the domestic price to Ptariff  The higher price causes domestic production to increase from QS  to QS  and causes domestic consumption to decline from QC  to QC           This has three main effects on societal welfare  Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus  green region  becomes smaller  Producers are better off because the producer surplus  yellow region  is made larger  The government also has additional tax revenue  blue region   However  the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government  The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles  Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society          An almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results  From that country s perspective  the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off  but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers  there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff   Under similar analysis  export tariffs  import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results      Sometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off  but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions  Free trade creates winners and losers  but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses       Trade diversion edit  According to mainstream economics theory  the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to economic inefficiency through the process of trade diversion  It is efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer  but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff  Applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss  This reason is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions  such as the Doha Round       Opinions edit  Economist opinions edit  The literature analysing the economics of free trade is rich  Economists have done extensive work on the theoretical and empirical effects of free trade  Although it creates winners and losers  the broad consensus among economists is that free trade provides a net gain for society          In a      survey of American economists     responders          agree that the U S  should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade  and        disagree with the suggestion that the U S  should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries       Quoting Harvard economics professor N  Gregory Mankiw    f ew propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards       In a survey of leading economists  none disagreed with the notion that  freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices  and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment       Most economists would agree citation needed  that although increasing returns to scale might mean that a certain industry could settle in a particular geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage  this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both winner and loser will increase  with the winner gaining more than the loser  but both gaining more than before in an absolute level  citation needed   Public Opinions edit  An overwhelming number of people internationally   both in developed and developing countries   support trade with other countries  but are more split when it comes to whether or not they believe trade creates jobs  increases wages  and decreases prices      The median belief in advanced economies is that trade increase increases wages  with    percent of people believing they do  compared to    percent who they decrease wages  In emerging economies     percent of people believe trade increases wages  compared to    percent who says it lowers wages  There is a positive relationship of      between the average GDP growth rate for the years      to      and the percentage of people in a given country that says trade increases wages      Most people  in both advanced and emerging economies  believe that trade increases prices     percent of people in advanced economies and    percent in emerging economies believe trade increases prices  and    percent and    percent  respectively  believe that trade lowers prices  Those with a higher level of education are more likely than those with less education to believe that trade lowers prices       History edit  See also  Timeline of international trade Early era edit  Further information  Anti Corn Law League  David Ricardo The notion of a free trade system encompassing multiple sovereign states originated in a rudimentary form in   th century Imperial Spain      American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Spanish theologian Francisco de Vitoria was  the first to set forth the notions  though not the terms  of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas       Vitoria made the case under principles of jus gentium      However  it was two early British economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo who later developed the idea of free trade into its modern and recognizable form  Economists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically  For example  Smith pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just Mediterranean cultures such as Egypt  Greece and Rome  but also of Bengal  East India  and China  The great prosperity of the Netherlands after throwing off Spanish Imperial rule and pursuing a policy of free trade     made the free trade mercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries  Free trade policies have battled with mercantilist  protectionist  isolationist  socialist  populist and other policies over the centuries  The Ottoman Empire had liberal free trade policies by the   th century  with origins in capitulations of the Ottoman Empire  dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in      and taken further with capitulations in       in      which lowered duties to only    for imports and exports and in       Ottoman free trade policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade such as J  R  McCulloch in his Dictionary of Commerce         but criticized by British politicians opposing free trade such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli  who cited the Ottoman Empire as  an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition  in the      Corn Laws debate  arguing that it destroyed what had been  some of the finest manufactures of the world  in             Average tariff rates in France  the United Kingdom and the United States Trade in colonial America was regulated by the British mercantile system through the Acts of Trade and Navigation  Until the     s  few colonists openly advocated for free trade  in part because regulations were not strictly enforced  New England was famous for smuggling   but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping  According to historian Oliver Dickerson  a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the American Revolution   The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong   wrote Dickerson   was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders       Free trade came to what would become the United States as a result of American Revolutionary War  After the British Parliament issued the Prohibitory Act  blockading colonial ports  the Continental Congress responded by effectively declaring economic independence  opening American ports to foreign trade on   April       According to historian John W  Tyler    f ree trade had been forced on the Americans  like it or not       In March       the Pope Pius VII ordered some liberalization of trade to face the economic crisis in the Papal States with the motu proprio Le pi  colte  Despite this  the export of national corn was forbidden to ensure the food for the Papal States    Britain waged two Opium Wars to force China to legalize the opium trade and to open all of China to British merchants In Britain  free trade became a central principle practiced by the repeal of the Corn Laws in       Large scale agitation was sponsored by the Anti Corn Law League  Under the Treaty of Nanking  China opened five treaty ports to world trade in       The first free trade agreement  the Cobden Chevalier Treaty  was put in place in      between Britain and France which led to successive agreements between other countries in Europe      Many classical liberals  especially in   th and early   th century Britain  e g  John Stuart Mill  and in the United States for much of the   th century  e g  Henry Ford and Secretary of State Cordell Hull   believed that free trade promoted peace  Woodrow Wilson included free trade rhetoric in his  Fourteen Points  speech of        The program of the world s peace  therefore  is our program  and that program  the only possible program  all we see it  is this           The removal  so far as possible  of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance      According to economic historian Douglas Irwin  a common myth about United States trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early   th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late   th century      A review by the Economist of Irwin s      book Clashing over Commerce  A History of US Trade Policy notes       Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there  A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall  and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again  By the time that happened  the economy would be recovering  giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery  Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power  a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today  As its share of global manufacturing powered from     in      to     in       the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost  estimated at around      of GDP in the mid     s  In some industries  they might have sped up development by a few years  But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas  According to Paul Bairoch  since the end of the   th century  the United States has been  the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism   In fact  the United States never adhered to free trade until       For the most part  the Jeffersonians strongly opposed it  In the   th century  statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Alexander Hamilton s themes within the Whig Party under the name American System  The opposition Democratic Party contested several elections throughout the     s      s and     s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry      The Democratic Party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only while the Whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries  The economist Henry Charles Carey became a leading proponent of the American System of economics  This mercantilist American System was opposed by the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson  Martin Van Buren  John Tyler  James K  Polk  Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan  The fledgling Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln  who called himself a  Henry Clay tariff Whig   strongly opposed free trade and implemented a     tariff during the Civil War  in part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort and in part to protect favored industries      William McKinley  later to become President of the United States  stated the stance of the Republican Party  which won every election for president from      until       except the two non consecutive terms of Grover Cleveland  as thus   Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave  Protection is but the law of nature  the law of self preservation  of self development  of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man   It is said  that protection is immoral        Why  if protection builds up and elevates             the U S  population  of people  the influence of those            of people elevates the rest of the world  We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefitting mankind everywhere  Well  they say   Buy where you can buy the cheapest    Of course  that applies to labor as to everything else  Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that  and it is the protection maxim   Buy where you can pay the easiest   And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards      During the interwar period  economic protectionism took hold in the United States  most famously in the form of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression             From       trade liberalization began to take place through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act   Post World War II edit  Since the end of World War II  in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War  the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff barriers and free trade  The United States helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later the World Trade Organization  although it had rejected an earlier version in the     s  the International Trade Organization      citation needed  Since the     s  United States governments have negotiated managed trade agreements  such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the     s  the Dominican

country may espouse free trade in principle  but ban certain drugs  such as alcohol  or certain practices  such as prostitution      and limiting international free trade  Some degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world  Most developed nations maintain controversial citation needed  agricultural tariffs  From      to       the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from    to      In the developing world  average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately          The American economist C  Fred Bergsten devised the bicycle theory to describe trade policy  According to this model  trade policy is dynamically unstable in that it constantly tends towards either liberalisation or protectionism  To prevent falling off the bike  the disadvantages of protectionism   trade policy and multilateral trade negotiations must constantly pedal towards greater liberalisation  To achieve greater liberalisation  decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests  However  Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work as this will both reduce the backlash against globalisation and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade        George W  Bush and Hu Jintao of China meet while attending an APEC summit in Santiago de Chile       In Kicking Away the Ladder  development economist Ha Joon Chang reviews the history of free trade policies and economic

policy  employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times  Britain abolished the Corn Laws which restricted import of grain in      in response to domestic pressures and reduced protectionism for

average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately        up until the     s  augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the   th century      The most consistent

the relative costs  benefits and beneficiaries of free trade  Arguments for protectionism fall into the economic category  trade hurts the economy or groups in the economy  or into the moral category  the effects of trade might help the economy  but have ill effects in other areas   A general argument against free trade is that it represents colonialism or imperialism in disguise  The moral category is wide  including concerns about      better source needed   destroying infant industries undermining long run economic development promoting income inequality tolerating environmental degradation supporting child labor and sweatshops race to the bottom wage slavery accentuating poverty in poor countries harming national defense forcing cultural change  The European Union Mercosur Free Trade Agreement would form one of the world s largest free trade areas  However  poor countries that have adopted free trade policies have experienced high economic growth  with China and India as prime examples  Free trade allows companies from rich countries to directly invest in poor countries  sharing their knowledge  providing capital and giving access to markets  Economic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories  Sociopolitical arguments against free trade cite social and political effects that economic arguments do not capture  such as political stability  national security  human rights and environmental protection  citation needed   Some products are important to national security and governments may deem it dangerous to allow domestic producers of these products to go out of business  especially if otherwise they might come to depend on producers who operate in a country that may one day become an enemy  Countries that allow low wages have a competitive advantage in attracting industry  which may lead to a general lowering of wages for workers in all countries  citation needed  Some countries may facilitate low cost production of goods in their countries by allowing pollution of the environment  their pricing ignores environmental full cost accounting and hidden costs are paid by their local  national and international neighbours  citation needed  Domestic industries often oppose free trade on the grounds that it would lower prices for imported goods would reduce their profits and market share          For example  if the United States reduced tariffs on imported sugar  sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits  and sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices  The economic theory of David Ricardo holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose          Since each of the domestic sugar producers would lose a lot while each of a great number of consumers would gain only a little  domestic producers are more likely to mobilize against the reduction in tariffs      More generally  producers often favor domestic subsidies and tariffs on imports in their home countries while objecting to subsidies and tariffs in their export markets   United States real wages vs  trade as a percent of GDP         Socialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum exploitation of workers by capital  For example  Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto          The bourgeoisie       has set up that single  unconscionable freedom   free trade  In one word  for exploitation  veiled by religious and political illusions  it has substituted naked  shameless  direct  brutal exploitation    Marx supported free trade  however  solely because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution      Many anti globalization groups oppose free trade based on their assertion that free trade agreements generally do not increase the economic freedom of the poor or of the working class and frequently make them poorer  Some opponents of free trade favor free trade theory  but oppose free trade agreements as applied  Some opponents of NAFTA see the agreement as materially harming the common people  but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government managed trade  rather than against free trade per se  For example  it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the United States into Mexico freely under NAFTA at prices well below production cost  dumping  because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers  Indeed  such subsidies violate free trade theory  so this argument is not actually against the principle of free trade  but rather against its selective implementation  citation needed   Research shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education      Hainmueller and Hiscox find  that the impact of education on how voters think about trade and globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena  than it does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or job security  This is not to say that the latter types of calculations are not important in shaping individuals  views of trade   just that they are not being manifest in the simple association between education and support for trade openness       A      study found that individuals whose occupations are routine task intensive and who do jobs that are offshorable are more likely to favor protectionism      Research suggests that attitudes towards free trade do not necessarily reflect individuals  self interests           Colonialism edit  Further information  Dependency theory  Map of colonial empires in      Various proponents of economic nationalism and of the school of mercantilism have long portrayed free trade as a form of colonialism or imperialism  In the   th century  such groups criticized British calls for free trade as cover for British Empire  notably in

issues throughout the   th and early   th centuries   Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa  in office from      to       denounced the  sophistry of free trade  in an introduction he wrote for a      book The Hidden Face of Free Trade Accords      which was written in part by Correa s Energy Minister Alberto Acosta  Citing as his source the      book Kicking Away the Ladder written by Ha Joon Chang      Correa identified the difference between an  American system  opposed to a  British System  of free trade  The Americans explicitly viewed the latter  he says  as  part of the British imperialist system   According to Correa  Chang showed that Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton  in office             rather than List  first presented a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism   Major free trade areas edit  Africa edit  Main article  African Continental Free Trade Area Europe edit  Main articles  European Union and European Free Trade Area Americas edit  Main

 never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy        If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it  better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry  employed in a way in which we have some advantage      This statement uses the concept of absolute advantage to present an argument in opposition to mercantilism  the dominant view surrounding trade at the time which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports and thus amass wealth      Instead  Smith argues  countries could gain from each producing exclusively the goods in which they are most suited to  trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption  In this vein  it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important  but the value of the goods produced by a nation  However  the concept of absolute advantage does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good      This theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage  Generally attributed to David Ricardo  who expanded on it in his      book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation      it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good  but on the relative opportunity costs of production  A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost  trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption  This allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production  While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods  they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of autarky          Exceptionally  Henry George s      book Protection or Free Trade was read out loud in full into the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen          American economist Tyler Cowen wrote that Protection or Free Trade  remains perhaps the best argued tract on free trade to this day       Although George is very critical towards protectionism  he discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor   We all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by water or land  we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals  the building of railways  the deepening of harbors  the improvement of steamships as beneficial  But if such things are beneficial  how can tariffs be beneficial  The effect of such things is to lessen the cost of transporting commodities  the effect of tariffs is to increase it  If the protective theory be true  every improvement that cheapens the carriage of goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be commensurately increased      George considers the general free trade argument inadequate  He argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never sufficient to improve the situation of the working class  unless accompanied by a shift towards land value tax
