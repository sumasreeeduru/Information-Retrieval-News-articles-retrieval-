broadcasting in June      but had to postpone its launch because its HDTV technology was not yet ready        The channel was due to be called Al Jazeera International  but the name was changed nine months before the launch because one of the channel s backers argued that original Arabic language channel already had an international scope     The channel was anticipated to reach around    million households  but it far exceeded that launch target  reaching    million homes     By       the service could be viewed in every major European market and was available to     million homes in over     countries via cable and satellite  according to a spokeswoman for the network in Washington     The channel  however  has poor penetration in the American market  where it has been carried by only one satellite service and a small number of cable networks      Al Jazeera English later began a campaign to enter the North American market  including a dedicated website      It became available to some cable subscribers in New York in August       having previously been available as an option for some viewers in Washington  D C   Ohio and Los Angeles      The channel primarily reaches the United States via its live online streaming  It is readily available on most major Canadian television providers including Rogers and Bell Satellite TV after the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission approved the channel for distribution in Canada on    November               Al Jazeera English and Iran s state run Press TV were the only international English language television broadcasters with journalists reporting from inside both Gaza and Israel during the           Israel Gaza conflict  Foreign press access to Gaza has been limited via either Egypt or Israel  However  Al Jazeera s reporters Ayman Mohyeldin and Sherine Tadros were already inside Gaza when the conflict began and the network s coverage was often compared to CNN s initial coverage from inside Baghdad in the early days of the      Gulf War              The channel may also be viewed online  It recommends online viewing at its own website     or at its channel on YouTube      Al Jazeera

request of pay television providers to almost      American programing      Regardless Al Jazeera America maintained a close working relationship with Al Jazeera English  The channel aired Newshour in

gather and produce news  It also shares resources with its Arabic language sister channel s    bureaux  Al Jazeera Balkan s bureaux and Al Jazeera Turk s bureaux for    bureaux      This is a significant difference from the present trend   The mainstream American networks have cut their bureaux to the bone     They re basically only in London now  Even CNN has pulled back  I remember in the    s when I covered these events there would be a truckload of American journalists and crews and editors and now Al Jazeera outnumbers them all     That s where  in the absence of alternatives

where it was available were Bristol County  Rhode Island  Toledo and Sandusky  Ohio  Burlington  Vermont  Houston  Texas  and Washington  DC      Industry giant Comcast originally planned to carry Al Jazeera English in       but reversed its decision shortly before the channel s launch  citing  the already saturated television market       The two major American satellite providers  DirecTV and Dish Network  had similar plans but also changed their minds  with speculation that the decision may have been influenced by allegations by the Bush administration of  anti American bias  in the

during the time that Al Jazeera America was in existence  With the closure of Al Jazeera America in April      it was expected that the official live stream of Al Jazeera English and access to its programmes would eventually be restored to the United States          The online live stream of Al Jazeera English was made available to viewers in the United States once again in September        Controversies edit  Al Jazeera English journalists Egyptian detainment edit  Main article          detention of Al Jazeera journalists by Egypt In December       three Al Jazeera English journalists  Peter Greste  Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed  were arrested in their Cairo Marriott hotel rooms  They were detained on charges of delivering  false news  and  aiding a terrorist organization  in Egypt following the      Egyptian coup d  tat  Al Jazeera was one of several websites to which the Egyptian government blocked access after accusing the network of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood  which was removed from power during the      coup  Egypt has been accused of limiting freedom of expression in an attempt to suppress opposition to president al Sisi      The crew has had court trials that have been adjourned over    times where questionable evidence including video from other news organizations claimed to be from Al Jazeera English  inaudible audio recordings  pictures from a family vacation  a music video and video of sheep had been presented as evidence      The trial has been called out by free press groups and rights groups as a sham  The former Cairo Bureau chief from Al Jazeera English now works for sister channel AJ  after the shutdown of the bureau  During the detainment of the journalists Al Jazeera along with the BBC and other major news organizations launched the Twitter and social media campaign  FreeAJStaff  The campaign included moments of silence while holding the hashtag as well as protesting at Egyptian embassies in various countries among other things  Calls from the United Nations  European Union and the United States for the journalists to be released were ignored  On    June       the three journalists were found guilty by an Egyptian court  Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to   years in prison while Mohamed was sentenced to    years  The ruling was denounced by fellow journalists  including some at BBC  CNN  ABC Australia and most other major news outlets along with world leaders from Australia  Canada  The United States  United Nations  Switzerland and the United Kingdom primarily because they were found guilty based on no actual evidence in a case that has been deemed politically motivated and also because the ruling was seen as an attack on press freedom  The response was especially negative on the part of United States Secretary of State John Kerry who a day earlier was in Egypt and was made a promise of press freedom by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi  The ruling has resulted in many negative stories in print  online and on television by various news outlets around the world calling the Egyptian justice system a kangaroo court and calling the Egyptian government authoritarian          There were various calls for amnesty  clemancy and pardons by various governments and news agencies all of which were declined by the Egyptian government who claimed that their justice system was independent and to respect the courts decision and stay out of Egyptian affairs      There were also calls for the United States to end or hold funding for the Egyptian military in response to the case  Peter Greste was released from prison and deported back to Australia on   February           On    August       Fahmy  Greste and Mohamed were sentenced to   years in prison in a decision heavily criticized internationally      The Government of Canada worked to have Fahmy pardoned and deported      On    September       Fahmy and Mohamed were pardoned by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el Sisi along with     other people and released from prison       Expulsion from China edit  Al Jazeera English s longtime China correspondent Melissa Chan was expelled from the country in           The Chinese government did not provide any public reasons but was known to have been unhappy over a documentary the channel had aired on China s prison system              On   May       reporters from the Beijing press corps asked about the expulsion at the Chinese Foreign Ministry s daily press briefing  Officials did not provide an explanation  and censored most of the questions when they published their official transcript      Chan later worked at Al Jazeera America       Criticism edit  Main article  Al Jazeera controversies and criticism As with Al Jazeera s Arabic counterpart  the network has received criticism from having bias from several sides   Allegations of Anti American bias edit  Al Jazeera English has frequently been criticized for having an anti American bias  although some commentators who   have asserted that this has been lessened over time  Emmy award winning journalist Dave Marash  who served as a veteran correspondent for ABC s Nightline  resigned from his position as Washington anchor for Al Jazeera English in       Marash cited  reflexive adversarial editorial stance  against Americans and  anti American bias           According to the media scholar Marwan M  Kraidy  when launching the English network  Al Jazeera framed the new channel as a competitor to BBC and CNN  but with coverage oriented towards the Global South      It is often unclear whether recent discussions of anti American bias at Al Jazeera are referring also to Al Jazeera English or only to Al Jazeera s Arabic language channel  There are significant differences in tone between the English and Arabic language channels   According to bilingual Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab   The English channel uses more neutral terminology  the Arab channel is much harsher        An example of this is a      claim by Bill O Reilly that Al Jazeera is  anti Semitic  and  anti American  and a subsequent defense of Al Jazeera against these claims made by former Al Jazeera English anchor Dave Marash on the O Reilly Factor          Another example concerns statements by former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  who in April      denounced Al Jazeera s Arabic language coverage of the Iraq War as  vicious  inaccurate and inexcusable   but took a more conciliatory tone in a      interview for Frost Over The World  Al Jazeera English s news and public affairs program hosted by David Frost  praising the network as  an important means of communication in the world       The government of which Rumsfeld was part had deliberately targeted Al Jazeera journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan  and discussed bombing its headquarters in Doha      page needed  On    October       Al Jazeera English broadcast interviews with people attending a Sarah Palin United States presidential election rally in St  Clairsville  Ohio  with interviewees making comments about Barack Obama such as  he regards white people as trash  and  I m afraid if he wins  the blacks will take over   The report received over two million views on YouTube      Following this  The Washington Post ran an op ed      claiming the news channel was deliberately encouraging  anti American sentiment overseas       which was criticized by Al Jazeera as  a gratuitous and uninformed shot at Al Jazeera s motives   as the report was just one of  hundreds of hours of diverse coverage        Criticism of an Anti American bias has been dwindling as their coverage of the Arab Spring received wide acclaim and calls for the network to be added to U S  television       Subsequent endeavours have been seen as tests by Al Jazeera to see whether it can get rid of the hostility Americans feel toward it  One example was a day s worth of special coverage marking the   th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of    September            Al Jazeera has also launched The Stream  a show based in Washington D C  that discusses social media  which targets an American audience            On   January       Al Jazeera purchased the American channel Current TV and rebranded as Al Jazeera America in August                 Awards edit  Main article  List of awards awarded to Al Jazeera English As of May
