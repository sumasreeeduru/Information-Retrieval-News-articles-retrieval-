the bordering state of Assam  and in certain parts of Bangladesh  The Khasi people form the majority of the population of the eastern part of Meghalaya  and is the state s largest community  with around     of the population of Meghalaya  They are among the few Austroasiatic speaking peoples in South Asia  A cultural tradition of the Khasi people is that they follow the matrilineal system of descent and inheritance  Under the Constitution of India  the Khasis have been granted the status of Scheduled Tribe   Contents    History      Khasi mythology     Language     Modern times

edit  Khasi mythology edit   Khasi woman and standing stones  near Laitlyngkot  Meghalaya  India Khasi mythology traces the tribe s original abode to  Ki Hyn iewtrep   The Seven Huts       According to the Khasi mythology  U Blei Trai Kynrad  God  the Lord Master  had originally distributed the human race into    heavenly families  Khadhynriew Trep      However  seven out of these    families were stuck on earth while the other   are stuck in heaven  According to the myth  a heavenly ladder resting on the sacred Lum Sohpetbneng Peak  located in the present day Ri Bhoi district  enabled people to go freely and frequently to heaven whenever they pleased until one day they were tricked into cutting a divine tree which was situated at Lum Diengiei Peak  also in present day East Khasi Hills district   a grave error which prevented them access to the heavens forever  This myth is often seen by whom   as a metaphor of how nature and trees  in particular  are the manifestation of the divine on Earth and destroying nature and trees means severing our ties with the Divine  Like the Japanese  the Khasis use the rooster as a symbol because they believe that it was he who aroused God and also humbly paved and cleared the path for God to create the Universe at the beginning of time  The rooster is the symbol of morning marking a new beginning and a new sunrise   Language edit  See also  Peopling of India The Khasi language is classified as part of the Austroasiatic language family  According to Peter Wilhelm Schmidt   the Khasi people are related to the Mon Khmer people of South East Asia  Multiple types of research indicate that the Austroasiatic populations in India are derived from migrations from Southeast Asia during the Holocene period  Many of the words are similar to other Austroasiatic languages such as Palaung and Khmer language   Tiger  Khla  Both Khasi  Khmer   To fly  Her in  Khasi   haer in  Khmer  Belly  kpoh in  khasi   poh in  khmer   bung in

Sino Tibetan languages  such as nga meaning  I   which is the same in Tibetan  Burmese  and Old Chinese as it is in Khasi  Traces of connections with the Kachin tribe of North Burma have also been in the Khasis  The Khasi people also have their own word for the Himalayan mountains which is  Ki Lum Mankashang  which means that at one point in time  they did cross the mighty mountains  Therefore  all these records and their present culture  features  and language strongly show that they also have a strong Tibeto Himalayan  Burman influence  The word  Khas  means hills and they have always been people of cold and hilly regions and have never been connected to the plains or arid regions  This nature loving tribe calls the wettest place on Earth their home  The village of Mawsynram in Meghalaya receives     inches of rain per year  Primarily an oral language  they had no script of their own  they used the Bengali script until the arrival of the Welsh missionaries  Particularly significant in this regard was a Welsh evangelist  Thomas Jones  who had transcribed the Khasi language into the Roman Script   Modern times edit  The Khasis first came in contact with the British in       after the latter captured Assam  The area inhabited by the Khasis became a part of the Assam province after the Khasi Hill States  which numbered to about    kingdoms  entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British  The main crops produced by the Khasi people are betel leaf  areca nut  oranges  local Khasi rice and vegetables   Geographical distribution and sub groups edit   Khasi states       According to the      Census of India  over      million Khasi lived in Meghalaya in the districts of East Khasi Hills  West Khasi Hills  South West Khasi Hills  Ri Bhoi  West Jaintia Hills and East Jaintia Hills  In Assam  their population reached         It is generally considered by many Khasi sociologists that the Khasi Tribe consist of seven sub tribes  hence the title  Children of the Seven Huts   Khynriam  Pnar  Bhoi  War  Maram  Lyngngam and Diko  The Khynriam  or Nongphlang  inhabit the uplands of the East Khasi Hills District  the Pnar or Synteng live in the uplands of the Jaintia Hills  The Bhoi live in the lower hills to the north and north east of the Khasi Hills  and Jaintia Hills towards the Brahmaputra valley  a vast area now under Ri Bhoi District  The War  usually divided into War Jaintia and War Khynriam in the south of the Khasi Hills  live on the steep southern slopes leading to Bangladesh  The Maram inhabit the uplands of the central parts of West Khasi Hills Districts  The Lyngngam people who inhabit the western parts of the West Khasi Hills bordering the Garo Hills display linguistic and cultural characteristics which show influences from both the Khasis to their east and the Garo people to the west  The last sub group completing the  seven huts   are the Diko  an extinct group who once inhabited the lowlands of the West Khasi Hills    Khasi women in traditional dress  A Khasi man Dress edit   Khasi children        Dancers during the festival of Shad Suk Mynsiem in Shillong The traditional Khasi male dress is a Jymphong  a longish sleeveless coat without collar  fastened by thongs in front  Nowadays  most male Khasis have adopted western attire  On ceremonial occasions they appear in a Jymphong and sarong with an ornamental waist band and they may also wear a turban  The traditional Khasi female dress is called the Jainsem or Dhara  both of which are rather elaborate with several pieces of cloth  giving the body a cylindrical shape  On ceremonial occasions  they may wear a crown of silver or gold  A spike or peak is fixed to the back of the crown  corresponding to the feathers worn by the menfolk  The Jainsem consists of two pieces of material fastened at each shoulder  The  Dhara  consists of a single piece of material also fastened at each shoulder   Marriage edit  The Khasis are  for the most part  monogamous  Their social organisation does not favour other forms of marriage  therefore  deviation from this norm is quite rare  Young men and women are permitted considerable freedom in the choice of mates  Potential marriage partners are likely to have been acquainted before betrothal  Once a man has selected his desired spouse  he reports his choice to his parents  They then secure the services of a mediator to make the arrangements with the woman s family  provided that the man s clan agree with his choice   The parents of the woman ascertain her wishes and if she agrees to the arrangement her parents check to make certain that the man to be wed is not a member of their clan  since Khasi clans are exogamous  marital partners may not be from the same clan   If this is satisfactory then a wedding date is set  Divorce  with causes ranging from incompatibility to lack of offspring  is easily obtainable  This ceremony traditionally consists of the husband handing the wife   cowries or paisa which the wife then hands back to her husband along with   of her own  The husband then throws these away or gives them to a village elder who throws them away   Present day Khasis divorce through the Indian legal system  The type of marriage is the determining factor in the marital residence  In short  post marital residence for a married man when an heiress  known as Ka Khadduh  is involved must be matrilocal  that is  in his mother in law s house   while post marital residence when a non heiress is involved is neolocal  Generally  Khasi men prefer to marry a non heiress because it will allow them to form independent family units somewhat immune to pressures from the wife s kin  Traditionally  though nowadays rule is not absolutely true   a Khasi man returns to his Iing Kur  maternal home  upon the death of his spouse  if she is a Khadduh and they both have no children   These practices are the result of rules governing inheritance and property ownership  These rules are themselves related to the structure of the Khasi Kur  clan system    Onomastics edit  Khasi names are known for their originality and elaborate nature   The given names may be invented by parents for their children  and these can be based on traditional native names  Christian names  or other English words   The family names  which they call  surnames   remain typically in the native Khasi language  The Khasi people do not have sub tribes  a confusion that sometimes arises from the expression Khynriam  u Pnar  u Bhoi  u War  This term is mainly based on the geographical location a Khasi inhabits  Khasi inhabiting the northern part are known as Bhoi  as that area is often called Ri Bhoi  People in the east are known as the Pnar  and they call their land as Rilum Jaintia  The south are called War or Ri War  because of its mountainous regions and soil fertility  The west has a number of regional names  Maram  Rimen  Khatsawphra  Mawiang  Lyngam  A Khasi who inhabits the central area is known as Khynriam  The War inhabitants of the Khasi community designed and built living root bridges of the War region    Traditional polities edit   The royal seat of Khyrim at Smit The traditional political structure of the Khasi community is democratic in nature  In the past  the Khasis consisted of independent native states called Syiemships  where male elders of various clans under the leadership of the Chief  called U Syiem  would congregate during Durbars or sessions and come to a decision regarding any dispute or problem that would arise in the Syiemship  At the village level  there exists a similar arrangement where all the residents of the village or town come together under the leadership of an elected Headman  called U Rangbah Shnong  to decide on matters pertaining to the locality  This system of village administration is much like the Panchayati Raj prevalent in most Indian States  There were around    independent native states on record which were annexed and acceded to the Indian Union  The Syiems of these native states  called Hima  were traditionally elected by the people or ruling clans of their respective domains  Famous among these Syiemships are Hima Mylliem  Hima Khyrim  Hima Nongkhlaw  amongst others  These Syiemships continue to exist and function till today under the purview of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council  KHADC   which draws its legal power and authority from the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India      Religion edit  Before the arrival of Christian missionaries  the majority of the Khasi people practiced an indigenous tribal religion        Though around     of the Khasi populace have embraced Christianity  a substantial minority of the Khasi people still follow and practice their age old indigenous religion  which is known as Ka Niam Khasi and Niam tre  The main Christian denominations followed by the Khasis include Catholicism  Anglicanism  Presbyterianism  largest Christian denomination among the Khasis   and others  There are also a small number of Khasis  as a result of inter community marriages  who are Muslims  There are also followers of Khasi Unitarianism as founded by Hajom Kissor Sing Lyngdoh Nongbri  citation needed   Notable people edit  U Tirot Sing Syiem  freedom fighter and martyr U Kiang Nangbah  freedom fighter and martyr George
