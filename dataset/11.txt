       Historian  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Scholar who deals with the exploration and presentation of history For other uses  see Historian  disambiguation    Herodotus  c      c      BC  was a Greek historian who lived in the  th century BC and one of the earliest historians whose work survives  A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it     Historians are concerned with the continuous  methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race  as well as the study of all history in time  If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history  the individual is a historian of prehistory  Some historians are recognized by publications or training and experience       Historian  became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere   Contents    Objectivity

Further reading   External links   Objectivity edit  During the Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt trial  it became evident that the court needed to identify what was an  objective historian  in the same vein as the reasonable person  and reminiscent of the standard traditionally used in English law of  the man on the Clapham omnibus      This was necessary so that there would be a legal bench mark to compare and contrast the scholarship of an objective historian against the illegitimate methods employed by David Irving  as before the Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt trial  there was no legal precedent for what constituted an objective historian     Justice Gray leant heavily on the research of one of the expert witnesses  Richard J  Evans  who compared illegitimate distortion of the historical record practice by holocaust deniers with established historical methodologies     By summarizing Gray s judgement  in an article published in the Yale Law Journal  Wendie E  Schneider distils these seven points for what he meant by an objective historian       The historian must treat sources with appropriate reservations  The historian must not dismiss counter evidence without scholarly consideration  The historian must be even handed in treatment of evidence and eschew  cherry picking   The historian must clearly indicate any speculation  The historian must not mistranslate documents or mislead by omitting parts of documents  The historian must weigh the authenticity of all accounts  not merely those that contradict his or her favored view  and The historian must take the motives of historical actors into consideration   Schneider uses the concept of the  objective historian  to suggest that this could be an aid in assessing what makes a historian suitable as an expert witnesses under the Daubert standard in the United States  Schneider proposed this  because  in her opinion  Irving could have passed the standard Daubert tests unless a court was given  a great deal of assistance from historians      Schneider proposes that by testing a historian against the criteria of the  objective historian  then  even if a historian holds specific political views  and she gives an example of a well qualified historian s testimony that was disregarded by a United States court because he was a member of a feminist group   providing the historian uses the  objective historian  standards  he or she is a  conscientious historian   It was Irving s failure as an  objective historian  not his right wing views that caused him to lose his libel case  as a  conscientious historian  would not have  deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence  to support his political views      History analysis edit  Main article  Historical method The process of historical analysis involves investigation and analysis of competing ideas  facts  and purported facts to create coherent narratives that explain  what happened  and  why or how it happened   Modern historical analysis usually draws upon other social sciences  including economics  sociology  politics  psychology  anthropology  philosophy  and linguistics  While ancient writers do not normally share modern historical practices  their work remains valuable for its insights within the cultural context of the times  An important part of the contribution of many modern historians is the verification or dismissal of earlier historical accounts through reviewing newly discovered sources and recent scholarship or through parallel disciplines like archaeology   Historiography edit  Main article  Historiography Ancient edit   Reproduction of part of a tenth century copy of Thucydides s History of the Peloponnesian War  Understanding the past appears to be a universal human need  and the telling of history has emerged independently in civilizations around the world  What constitutes history is a philosophical question  see philosophy of history   The earliest chronologies date back to Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt  though no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name  Systematic historical thought emerged in ancient Greece  a development that became an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around the Mediterranean region  The earliest known critical historical works were The Histories  composed by Herodotus of Halicarnassus        c      BCE  who later became known as the  father of history   Cicero   Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts  and personally conducted research by travelling extensively  giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures  Although Herodotus  overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men  he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events  Thucydides largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta  establishing a rationalistic element that set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings  He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event  while his successor Xenophon  c            BCE  introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his Anabasis    Leonardo Bruni  c             the historian who first divided history into the three eras of Antiquity  the Middle Ages  and Modern times  The Romans adopted the Greek tradition  While early Roman works were still written in Greek  the Origines  composed by the Roman statesman Cato the Elder          BCE   was written in Latin  in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence  Strabo     BCE   c     CE  was an important exponent of the Greco Roman tradition of combining geography with history  presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era  Livy     BCE      CE  records the rise of Rome from city state to empire  His speculation about what would have happened if Alexander the Great had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of alternate history     In Chinese historiography  the Classic of History is one of the Five Classics of Chinese classic texts and one of the earliest narratives of China   The Spring and Autumn Annals  the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from     to     BCE  is among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts arranged on annalistic principles  Sima Qian  around     BCE  was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing  His written work was the Shiji  Records of the Grand Historian   a monumental lifelong achievement in literature  Its scope extends as far back as the   th century BCE  and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people  and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners  both contemporary and those of previous eras       A page of Bede s Ecclesiastical History of the English People Christian historiography began early  perhaps as early as Luke Acts  which is the primary source for the Apostolic Age  Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the Middle Ages  They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ  that of the Church and that of their patrons  the dynastic history of the local rulers   In the Early Middle Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year  but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes      An example of this type of writing is the Anglo Saxon Chronicles  which were the work of several different writers  it was started during the reign of Alfred the Great in the late  th century  but one copy was still being updated in           Muslim historical writings first began to develop in the  th century  with the reconstruction of the Prophet Muhammad s life in the centuries following his death  With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his companions from various sources  scholars had to verify which sources were more reliable  To evaluate these sources  they developed various methodologies  such as the science of biography  science of hadith and Isnad  chain of transmission   They later applied these methodologies to other historical figures in the Islamic civilization  Famous historians in this tradition include Urwah  d        Wahb ibn Munabbih  d        Ibn Ishaq  d        al Waqidi            Ibn Hisham  d        Muhammad al Bukhari           and Ibn Hajar               Enlightenment edit  During the Age of Enlightenment  the modern development of historiography through the application of scrupulous methods began    Voltaire s works of history are an excellent example of Enlightenment era history writing  Painting by Pierre Charles Baquoy  French philosophe Voltaire             had an enormous influence on the art of history writing  His best known histories are The Age of Louis XIV         and Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations          My chief object   he wrote in        is not political or military history  it is the history of the arts  of commerce  of civilization   in a word    of the human mind       He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events  and emphasized customs  social history  and achievements in the arts and sciences  He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world  eliminating theological frameworks  and emphasizing economics  culture  and political history    Edward Gibbon s Decline of the Roman Empire        was a masterpiece of late   th century history writing  At the same time  philosopher David Hume was having a similar impact on history in Great Britain  In       he published the History of England  a six volume work that extended from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in       Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history  as well as the history of Kings  Parliaments  and armies  he examined the history of culture  including literature and science  as well      William Robertson  a Scottish historian  and the Historiographer Royal     published the History of Scotland              in      and his most famous work  The history of the reign of Charles V in           His scholarship was painstaking for the time and he was able to access a large number of documentary sources that had previously been unstudied  He was also one of the first historians who understood the importance of general and universally applicable ideas in the shaping of historical events      The apex of Enlightenment history was reached with Edward Gibbon s  monumental six volume work  The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire  published on    February       Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources  at the time its methodology became a model for later historians  This has led to Gibbon being called the first  modern historian       The book sold impressively  earning its author a total of about        Biographer Leslie Stephen wrote that thereafter   His fame was as rapid as it has been lasting      th century edit  The tumultuous events surrounding the French Revolution inspired much of the historiography and analysis of the early   th century  Interest in the      Glorious Revolution was also rekindled by the Great Reform Act of      in England  Thomas Carlyle published his magnum opus  the three volume The French Revolution  A History in               The resulting work had a passion new to historical writing  Thomas Macaulay produced his most famous work of history  The History of England from the Accession of James the Second  in            His writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident  sometimes dogmatic  emphasis on a progressive model of British history  according to which the country threw off superstition  autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression  This model of human progress has been called the Whig interpretation of history        Jules Michelet  later in his career  In his main work Histoire de France  French historian Jules Michelet coined the term Renaissance  meaning  Re birth  in French language   as a period in Europe s cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages  creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world      The nineteen volume work covered French history from Charlemagne to the outbreak of the Revolution  Michelet was one of the first historians to shift the emphasis of history to the common people  rather than the leaders and institutions of the country  Another important French historian of the period was Hippolyte Taine  He was the chief theoretical influence of French naturalism  a major proponent of sociological positivism and one of the first practitioners of historicist criticism  Literary historicism as a critical movement has been said to originate with him      One of the major progenitors of the history of culture and art  was the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt     Burckhardt s best known work is The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy         According to John Lukacs  he was the first master of cultural history  which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age  a particular people  or a particular place      By the mid   th century  scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change  particularly the development of constitutional government  William Stubbs s  Constitutional History of England    vols            was an important influence on this developing field  The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until       and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning      Karl Marx introduced the concept of historical materialism into the study of world historical development  In his conception  the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point  Previous historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations  Process of nationalization of history  as part of national revivals in the   th century  resulted with separation of  one s own  history from common universal history by such way of perceiving  understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation      A new discipline  sociology  emerged in the late   th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale   Professionalization in Germany edit   Ranke established history as a professional academic discipline in Germany  The modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in   th century German universities  Leopold von Ranke was a pivotal influence in this regard  and is considered as the founder of modern source based history                  Specifically  he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom  and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents  Beginning with his first book in       the History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from      to       Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age  including  memoirs  diaries  personal and formal missives  government documents  diplomatic dispatches and first hand accounts of eye witnesses   Over a career that spanned much of the century  Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing  introducing such ideas as reliance on primary sources  empiricism   an emphasis on narrative history and especially international politics  aussenpolitik        Sources had to be hard  not speculations and rationalizations  His credo was to write history the way it was  He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity         th century edit  The term Whig history was coined by Herbert Butterfield in his short book The Whig Interpretation of History in        a reference to the British Whigs  advocates of the power of Parliament  to refer to the approach to historiography that presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment  culminating in modern forms of liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy  In general  Whig historians emphasized the rise of constitutional government  personal freedoms  and scientific progress  The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of British history  the history of science  for example  to criticize any teleological  or goal directed   hero based  and transhistorical narrative      Butterfield s antidote to Whig history was     to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past  the sensibility which studies the past  for the sake of the past   which delights in the concrete and the complex  which  goes out to meet the past   which searches for  unlikenesses between past and present        Butterfield s formulation received much attention  and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalised terms is no longer academically respectable        The   th century saw the creation of a huge variety of historiographical approaches  Marc Bloch s focus on social history rather than traditional political history was of tremendous influence  The French Annales School radically changed the focus of historical research in France during the   th century by stressing long term social history  rather than political or diplomatic themes  The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography          An eminent member of this school  Georges Duby  described his approach to history as one that relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events  but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and  neglecting surface disturbances  to observe the long and medium term evolution of economy  society  and civilisation  Marxist historiography developed as a school of historiography influenced by the chief tenets of Marxism  including the centrality of social class and economic constraints in determining historical outcomes  Friedrich Engels wrote The Condition of the Working Class in England in       which was salient in creating the socialist impetus in British politics from then on  e g  the Fabian Society  R  H  Tawney s The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century            and Religion and the Rise of Capitalism         reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history  A circle of historians inside the Communist Party of Great Britain  CPGB  formed in      and became a highly influential cluster of British Marxist historians  who contributed to history from below and class structure in early capitalist society  Members included Christopher Hill  Eric Hobsbawm and E  P  Thompson  World history  as a distinct field of historical study  emerged as an independent academic field in the     s  It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures  Arnold J  Toynbee s ten volume A Study of History  written between      and       was an important influence on this developing field  He took a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations and demonstrated that they displayed striking parallels in their origin  growth  and decay      William H  McNeill wrote The Rise of the West        to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history  borrowing critical skills from one another  and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary       Education and profession edit  Further information  List of historians  Peter R L Brown  a professional historian of Late Antiquity and the Medieval period  An undergraduate history degree is often used as a stepping stone to graduate studies in business or law  Many historians are employed at universities and other facilities for post secondary education      In addition  it is normal for colleges and universities to require the PhD degree for new full time hires  A scholarly thesis  such as a PhD  is now regarded as the baseline qualification for a professional historian  However  some historians still gain recognition based on published  academic  works and the award of fellowships by academic bodies like the Royal Historical Society  Publication is increasingly required by smaller schools  so graduate papers become journal articles and PhD dissertations become published monographs  The graduate student experience is difficult those who finish their doctorate in the United States take on average   or more years  funding is scarce except at a few very rich universities  Being a teaching assistant in a course is required in some programs  in others it is a paid opportunity awarded a fraction of the students  Until the     s it was rare for graduate programs to teach how to teach  the assumption was that teaching was easy and that learning how to do research was the main mission          A critical experience for graduate students is having a mentor who will provide psychological  social  intellectual and professional support  while directing scholarship and providing an introduction to the profession      Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities  archival centers  government agencies  museums  and as freelance writers and consultants      The job market for new PhDs in history is poor and getting worse  with many relegated to part time  adjunct  teaching jobs with low pay and no benefits       See also edit     Wikimedia Commons has media related to Historians   List of historians Antiquarian Auxiliary
