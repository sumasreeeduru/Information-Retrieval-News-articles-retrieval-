and competitions  Sports Journalism started in the early     s when it was targeted to the social elite and has transitioned into an integral part of the news business with newspapers having dedicated sports sections     The increased popularity of sports amongst the middle and lower class led to the more coverage of sports content in publications  The appetite for sports resulted in sports only publications like ESPN and Sports Illustrated  There are many different forms of sports journalism  ranging from play by play and game recaps to analysis and investigative journalism on important developments in the sport  Technology and the internet age has massively changed the sports journalism space as it is struggling with the same problems that the broader category of print journalism is struggling with  mainly not being able to cover costs due to falling subscriptions  New forms of internet blogging and tweeting in the current millennium have pushed the boundaries of sports

journalism finds its roots as content started to appear in newspapers in the early     s     At the start  the sports sporadically covered horse racing and boxing  The focus of the coverage would be less on the event itself and more on the greater social context  Horse races between the North and South and boxing bouts between US and England garnered much interest from the social elite  During the     s and   s  the primary demographic target for newspapers was the social elite as newspaper was too expensive for the common man     Approaching the   th century  several important changes occurred that lead to the increased saturation of sports journalism in the mainstream  The first was the advent of the penny press which allowed for cheaper and more tabloid style of newspaper production  Newspapers also began using advertising to pay for their production costs instead of relying on circulation  These two factors lead to a change in the target demographic from social elite upper class to the lower middle class     Simultaneously  the Industrial Revolution was creating a rapidly expanding middle class who were moving from the country side to booming urban developments  The change in the target demographic meant that newspaper publishers were looking for content that appealed to the masses so they turned to sports  These developments also coincided with the rising popularity of baseball which was rapidly becoming  America s Pastime      th century edit  The New York Herald was the first newspapers to publishing consistent sports coverage     The New York World in      was the first newspaper to have a full times sports department  The following period from           saw a massive increase in sports coverage in publications  A study showed that in      only    percent of space in the newspaper was dedicated to sports  By the     s  that proportion had risen to    percent     During this time  newspapers focused mainly on play by play coverage and game recaps of the sport events  Local publications started hiring beat reporters who were tasked with following all developments pertaining to the team  This included traveling with the team and interviewing the players  Teams also started constructing dedicated sections called press box in the stadiums for the press to sit and record notes on the game  As technology introduced new developments like the radio  television and the internet  the focus of sports coverage shifted from the play by play to statistical analysis of the game and background pieces on the players  This was also coupled with a massive increase in sports amongst the general public  The increased popularity of football  basketball and hockey meant more content to publish and more interested readers to publish to     This led to the creation of journals like Sports Illustrated  first published in       was one of the first publications to solely focus on sports  Sports Illustrated was the brainchild of Henry Lucre who felt that the established publishers at the time were not taking advantage of the public s massive appetite for sports     With weekly issues  Sports Illustrated was able to produce more classic journalistic pieces as the writers had more time to research and conduct longer interview sit downs with players and coaches      Digital Age edit  Since the start of the new millennium  circulation and advertising numbers of print newspapers having been falling rapidly  This has led to widespread cost cutting and layoffs across the industry  There are     percent fewer journalist in the workforce now when compared to the number of journalist in       These developments have significantly affected sports journalism as established publications like Sports Illustrated and ESPN have had to cut content  increase prices and reduce the number of publications which leads to more people unsubscribing from the content     The fall in print sports journalism can be tied to the rise of internet and digital sports journalism  Digital sports journalism serves as both a complement and a competitor of newspaper sports journalism  Digital sports journalism began in the mid     s with ESPN creating the first website in          At first digital sports journalism covered broad topics in scope  but as time went on and the internet became more widespread  bloggers and location and team specific websites started taking over the market     A majority of these smaller websites did not charge a subscription fee as it was funded on advertising  This lower cost to the consumer as well as increased access to variety of very specific content led to the shift away from print and towards digital  However  the growth seen in the digital space which has increased advertising revenue has not balanced out the losses from print journalism     The importance of click count has gone up as these sites are being funded by online advertisers  This has led to many shorter journalistic pieces offering controversial opinions in order to generate the most clicks     Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe  Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists  and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards  They must take care not to show bias for any team   Socio political significance edit  Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio political significance  Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball is an example of this  Modern controversies regarding the hyper compensation of top athletes  the use of anabolic steroids and other  banned performance enhancing drugs  and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure  especially for Olympic Games  also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages  Recently  the issue of Colin Kaepernick s protest of injustice shown to people of color by the police by kneeling during the performance of the national anthem before his football games has created diverse and varied coverage  His actions have taken his discussion from the sports field and into the national scope as major political pundits and even the Presidents commenting on the ethics of his actions     Kaepernick cites that his position as a quarterback in the National Football League gives him a unique opportunity to carry out his message     Kaepernick s actions have inspired a wave of athletes using their position to take on social issues ranging from abortion to college athletes getting monetary compensation  Sports journalism plays a significant role in how these views are conveyed to the public  The author creates a story from the raw quotes provided by the athlete and this is published to thousands of viewers  Inherent in the publication will be the biases of the author and this will be passed on to the reader  cite   As sports moves more and more into the political discussion space  sports journalist will have increasingly more power over the public sentiment of the hottest issues at the moment         Future of sports journalism edit  There has been a major shift within sports in the last decade as more sports teams are switching to using analytics  A large reason for this shift is due to many articles being published about the increased benefit of using analytics to make strategic decisions in a game        As there is data collected about every instance in every sport  sports data analysis has increased  Sports publications are now hiring people with extensive background in statistics and mathematics in order to publish articles detailing the analysis these teams are conducting  New metrics have been created to study the quality of player performance     The metrics have also been used to compile rankings of players and teams  Blog sites like FiveThirtyEight began to sprout as full time sport analytic sites that took available data and constructed analytic heavy articles pertaining to sports  ESPN has implemented a segment in their shows called  Sports Science  where stars of every sport come in to test how advanced analytics affect field performance      There has been much pushback by many over the use of analytics in sports  Many established coaches are quick to bash analytics as narrow and ignorant of the big picture          In Europe edit  The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England  where several modern sports   such as association football  cricket  athletics and rugby   were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today  Andrew Warwick has suggested that The Boat Race provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage      The Race  an annual rowing event between the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford  has been held annually from       Cricket  possibly because of its esteemed place in society  has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers  The Manchester Guardian  in the first half of the   th century  employed Neville Cardus as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic  Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism  One of his successors  John Arlott  who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the BBC  was also known for his poetry  The first London Olympic Games in      attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best known writers to the event  The Daily Mail even had Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at the White City Stadium to cover the finish of the Marathon  Such was the drama of that race  in which Dorando Pietri collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading  that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian  having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification  awarded a special silver cup  which was presented by Queen Alexandra  And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in Boston  Massachusetts  and London  and at future Olympics  were henceforward staged over exactly the same     mile      yard distance used for the      Olympic Marathon  and the official length of the event worldwide to this day  The London race  called the Polytechnic Marathon and originally staged over the      Olympic route from outside the royal residence at Windsor Castle to White City  was first sponsored by the Sporting Life  which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events  rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the Second World War  The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events  The first sports reporter in Great Britain  and one of the first sports reporters in the World  was an English writer Edgar Wallace  who made a report on The Derby on June         for the British Broadcasting Company  In France  L Auto  the predecessor of L Equipe  had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in      that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country  The Tour de France was born  and sports journalism s role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey   the color of the paper on which L Auto was published  in Italy  the Giro d Italia established a similar tradition  with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper  La Gazzetta    Sports stars in the press box edit  After the Second World War  the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand  to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections  some Sunday tabloids even have sections  additional to the sports pages  devoted solely to the previous day s football reports  In some respects  this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which   until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media   would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings  Some newspapers  such as The Sunday Times  with      Olympic     metres champion Harold Abrahams  or the London Evening News using former England cricket captain Sir Leonard Hutton  began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns  which were often ghost written  Some such ghosted columns  however  did little to further the reputation of sports journalism  which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards  Many  ghosted  columns were often run by independent sports agencies  based in Fleet Street or in the provinces  who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles  These agencies included Pardons  or the Cricket Reporting Agency  which routinely provided the editors of the Wisden cricket almanac  and Hayters  Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents  The Daily Mirror s Peter Wilson  Hugh McIlvanney  first at The Observer and lately at the Sunday Times  Ian Wooldridge of the Daily Mail and soccer writer Brian Glanville  best known at the Sunday Times  and columnist Patrick Collins  of the Mail on Sunday  five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award  Many became household names in the late   th century through their trenchant reporting of events  spurring popularity  citation needed  the Massacre at the Munich Olympics in       Muhammad Ali s fight career  including his      title bout against George Foreman  the Heysel Stadium disaster  and the career highs and lows of the likes of Tiger Woods  George Best  David Beckham  Lester Piggott and other high profile stars  McIlvanney and Wooldridge  who died in March       aged     both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television  During his career  Wooldridge became so famous that  like the sports stars he reported upon  he hired the services of IMG  the agency founded by the American businessman  Mark McCormack  to manage his affairs  Glanville wrote several books  including novels  as well as scripting the memorable official film to the      World Cup staged in England   Investigative journalism and sport edit  Since the     s  the growing importance of sport  its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups  has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists  The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting  as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers  has meant that such long term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers  Tom Bower  with his      sports book of the year Broken Dreams  which analyzed British football  followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by Andrew Jennings and Vyv Simson with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee  Jennings and Simson s The Lords of the Rings in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the      Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City  Jennings would follow up with two further books on the Olympics and one on FIFA  the world football body  Likewise  award winning writers Duncan Mackay  of The Guardian  and Steven Downes unravelled many scandals involving doping  fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their      book  Running Scared  which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague  Cliff Temple  But the writing of such exposes   referred to as  spitting in the soup  by Paul Kimmage  the former Tour de France professional cyclist  now an award winning writer for the Sunday Times   often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day to day dealings with sportsmen and officials  as required by  beat  correspondents  The stakes can be high when upsetting sport s powers  in       England s FA opted to switch its multimillion pound contract for UK coverage rights of the FA Cup and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV  One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the England football team  citation needed   Sports books edit  Increasingly  sports journalists have turned to long form writing  producing popular books on a range of sporting topics  including biographies  history and investigations  Dan Topolski was the first recipient of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award in       which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature   Organizations edit  Most countries have their own national association of sports journalists  Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists  These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues  to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism  The International Sports Press Association  AIPS  was founded in      during the Olympic Games in Paris  at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France  by Frantz Reichel  the press chief of the Paris Games  and the Belgian Victor Boin  AIPS operates through a system of continental sub associations and national associations  and liaises closely with some of the world s biggest sports federations  including the International Olympic Committee  football s world governing body FIFA  and the IAAF  the international track and field body  The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives   to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members  to strengthen the friendship  solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries  to assure the best possible working conditions for the members  For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers  Association was founded in       was revived in       and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media    Press room at the Philips Stadion  home of PSV Eindhoven  prior to a press conference In Britain  the Sports Journalists  Association was founded in       It stages two awards events  an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year  and the British Sports Journalism Awards  the industry s  Oscars   sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March  Founded as the Sports Writers  Association  following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers  Association in       the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA  Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist Sir Michael Parkinson  The SJA represents the British sports media on the British Olympic Association s press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members  interests in a range of activities  In March       Martin Samuel  then the chief football correspondent of The Times  was named British Sportswriter of the Year  the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession  At the same awards  Jeff Stelling  of Sky Sports  was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time  a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members  Stelling won the vote again the following year  when the Sunday Times s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time  In the United States  the Indianapolis based National Sports Journalism Center monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry  The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors  In more recent years  when   sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services   Fanzines and blogs edit  Through the     s and     s  a rise in  citizen journalism  in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer  fanzines    cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media  Many continue today and thrive  Some authors  such as Jim Munro  have been adopted by their clubs  Once an editor of the West Ham United fanzine Fortune s Always Dreaming  Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of The Sun Online  Other titles  such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine When Saturday Comes  have effectively gone mainstream  The advent of the Internet has seen much of this fan generated energy directed into sports blogs  Ranging from team centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself  Bleacher Report  Deadspin com  ProFootballTalk com  BaseballEssential com  Tireball Sports  AOL Fanhouse  Masshole Sports  the blogs in the Yardbarker Network  and others have garnered massive followings   Smartphones edit  The rise of smartphone use has significantly altered the way sports media has taken off  Sports media is now accessible from almost anywhere at any time  Fans can check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media     Social media has also bolstered the sports media scene  Fans can not only check in with sports news on sites like Twitter and Facebook  but get more personal and direct content from the athletes and coaches  Videos and highlights of sporting events are also now easily shareable as well as journalist commentary  Since these platforms are generally free  this new wave of content is becoming a popular way to generate a following  This type of fast and easy information is very important to sports fans     This has changed the way content gets published on sites like Twitter where the author is restricted by a character count  Stories are condensed to     characters and are quick to the point  Sports breaking news is often first broken on Twitter      There is a big rush amongst sports insiders to be the one to break the information first   Female reporting edit  Women have not always been in the sports reporting field  Women such as Jane Chastain and Leslie Visser are considered pioneers in women s sportscasting  Chastain was the first woman to work for a large network  CBS  and the first woman to do play by play in the    s      Leslie Visser was a sportswriter for The Boston Globe before she joined CBS in      as a part time reporter  She is the only sportscaster in history  male or female  to have worked on the Final Four  NBA Finals  World Series  Monday Night Football  the Super Bowl  the Olympics  and the US Open broadcasts  She has been voted the No    Female Sportscaster of all time      There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games  If they are denied access  this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field  as they can interview players in the locker room after games  If locker room access is denied to all reporters   male and female   because of this controversy  male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away  It wasn t until      that female sports journalists were allowed to enter locker rooms for interviews  Sports Illustrated reporter  Melissa Ludtke  sued the New York Yankees for not allowing her to interview players in the locker room during the      World Series  A federal judge ruled that this ban was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the   th Amendment      Some female reporters include Adeline Daley  whom some consider the  Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters        Anita Martini  Tracy Dodds  Mary Garber
