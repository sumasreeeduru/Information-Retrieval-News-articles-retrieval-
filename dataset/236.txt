Thomas               and airing weeknights at      p m   It was simply Lowell Thomas in front of a television camera while doing his NBC network radio broadcast  the television simulcast seen only in New York     In June       NBC  through its flagship station in New York City  W XBS  renamed commercial WNBT in       now WNBC  operating on channel one  televised     hours of coverage of the Republican National Convention live and direct from Philadelphia  The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper New York State  for rebroadcast on W XB in Schenectady  now WRGB   making this among the first  network  programs of NBC Television  Due to wartime and technical restrictions  there were no live telecasts of the      conventions  although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day  About this time  there were irregularly scheduled  quasi network newscasts originating from NBC s WNBT in New York City   WNBC   and reportedly fed to WPTZ  now KYW TV  in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady  NY  Such as  Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II  another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York  Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few  roughly       television sets which existed at the time  After the war  NBC Television Newsreel aired filmed news highlights with narration  Later in       when sponsored by Camel Cigarettes  NBC Television Newsreel was renamed Camel Newsreel Theatre and then  when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on camera anchor in       the program was renamed Camel News Caravan  In       NBC teamed up with Life magazine to provide election night coverage of President Harry S  Truman s surprising victory over New York governor Thomas E  Dewey  The television audience was small  but NBC s share in New York was double that of any other outlet     The following year  the Camel News Caravan  anchored by John Cameron Swayze  debuted on NBC  Lacking the graphics and technology of later years  it nonetheless contained many of the elements of modern newscasts     NBC hired its own film crews and in the program s early years  it dominated CBS s competing program  which did not hire its own film crews until           by contrast  CBS spent lavishly on Edward R  Murrow s weekly series  See It Now      In       David Brinkley began serving as the program s Washington correspondent  but attracted little attention outside the network until paired with Chet Huntley in          In       the Camel News Caravan fell behind CBS s Douglas Edwards with the News  and Swayze lost the already tepid support of NBC executives     The following year  NBC replaced the program with the Huntley Brinkley Report  Beginning in       NBC News was managed by Director of News Bill McAndrew  who reported to Vice President of News and Public Affairs J  Davidson Taylor       Huntley Brinkley era edit   NBC News had close to     correspondents and cameramen in      who were stationed throughout the world  Film was received in the United States by plane or by the jointly operated NBC BBC transatlantic film cable  Television assumed an increasingly prominent role in American family life in the late     s  and NBC News was called television s  champion of news coverage       NBC president Robert Kintner provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time     In       the network paired anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley and the two became celebrities     supported by reporters including John Chancellor  Frank McGee  Edwin Newman  Sander Vanocur  Nancy Dickerson  Tom Pettit  and Ray Scherer  Created by Producer Reuven Frank  NBC s The Huntley Brinkley Report had its debut on October               During much of its    year run  it exceeded the viewership levels of its CBS News competition  anchored initially by Douglas Edwards and  beginning in April       by Walter Cronkite    NBC Logo      NBC s Vice President of News and Public Affairs  J  Davidson Taylor  was a Southerner who  with Producer Reuven Frank  was determined that NBC would lead television s coverage of the civil rights movement      In       NBC provided national coverage of Martin Luther King Jr  s leadership of the Montgomery bus boycott in Montgomery  Alabama  airing reports from Frank McGee  then News Director of NBC s Montgomery affiliate WSFA TV  who would later join the network      A year later  John Chancellor s coverage of the admission of black students to Central High School in Little Rock  Arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print     and prompted a prominent U S  senator to observe later   When I think of Little Rock  I think of John Chancellor        Other reporters who covered the movement for the network included Sander Vanocur  Herbert Kaplow  Charles Quinn  and Richard Valeriani      who was hit with an ax handle at a demonstration in Marion  Alabama in           While Walter Cronkite s enthusiasm for the space race eventually won the anchorman viewers for CBS and NBC News  with the work of correspondents such as Frank McGee  Roy Neal  Jay Barbree  and Peter Hackes  also provided ample coverage of American manned space missions in the Project Mercury  Project Gemini  and Project Apollo programs  In an era when space missions rated continuous coverage  NBC configured its largest studio  Studio  H  for space coverage  It utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft  maps of the earth and moon to show orbital trackage  and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer Bil Baird were used to depict movements of astronauts before on board spacecraft television cameras were feasible   Studio  H had been home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra and is now the home of Saturday Night Live   NBC s coverage of the first moon landing in      earned the network an Emmy Award      In the late     s  Kintner reorganized the chain of command at the network  making Bill McAndrew president of NBC News  reporting directly to Kintner       McAndrew served in that position until his death in           McAndrew was succeeded by his Executive Vice President  Producer Reuven Frank  who held the position until           On November           NBC interrupted various programs on its affiliate stations at      p m  to announce that President John F  Kennedy had been shot in Dallas  Texas  Eight minutes later  at         p m   NBC broke into programming with a network bumper slide and Chet Huntley  Bill Ryan and Frank McGee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened  but since a camera was not in service  the reports were audio only  However  NBC did not begin broadcasting over the air until      p m  ET  About    minutes later  after word came that JFK was pronounced dead  NBC suspended regular programming and carried    hours of uninterrupted news coverage of the assassination and the funeral of the president including the only live broadcast of the fatal shooting of Kennedy s assassin  Lee Harvey Oswald  by Jack Ruby as Oswald was being led in handcuffs by law enforcement officials through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters       NBC Nightly News era edit   NBC Nightly News Logo      NBC s ratings lead began to slip toward the end of the     s and fell sharply when Chet Huntley retired in       Huntley died of cancer in        The loss of Huntley  along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division  left NBC News in the doldrums  NBC s primary news show gained its present title  NBC Nightly News  on August          The network tried a platoon of anchors  Brinkley  McGee  and John Chancellor  during the early months of Nightly News  Despite the efforts of the network s eventual lead anchor  the articulate  even toned Chancellor  and an occasional first place finish in the Nielsens  Nightly News in the     s was primarily a strong second     By the end of the decade  NBC had to contend not only with a powerful CBS but also a surging ABC  led by Roone Arledge  Tom Brokaw became sole anchor in       after co anchoring with Roger Mudd for a year  and began leading NBC s efforts  In      and       NBC won the top spot in the Nielsens for the first time in years      only to fall back when Nielsen s ratings methodology changed  In late       Nightly News again moved into first place      a spot it has held onto in most of the succeeding years  Brian Williams assumed primary anchor duties when Brokaw retired in December           In February       NBC suspended Williams for six months for telling an inaccurate story about his experience in the      invasion of Iraq      He was replaced by Lester Holt on an interim basis  On June           it was announced that Holt would become the permanent anchor and Williams would be moved to MSNBC as an anchor of breaking news and special reports beginning in August        NBC Nightly News Set  In       Dateline NBC broadcast an investigative report about the safety of General Motors  GM  trucks  GM discovered the  actual footage  utilized in the broadcast had been rigged by the inclusion of explosive incendiaries attached to the gas tanks and the use of improper sealants for those tanks  GM subsequently filed an anti defamation lawsuit against NBC  which publicly admitted the results of the tests were rigged and settled the lawsuit with GM on the very same day      On October           Nightly News moved into its new high definition studios  at Studio  C at NBC Studios in    Rockefeller Plaza in New York City  The network s    hour cable network  MSNBC  joined the network in New York on that day as well  The new studios headquarters for NBC News and MSNBC are now located in one area  citation needed             edit  During the financial crisis of            NBC News was urged to save      million by NBC Universal  On that occasion  NBC News laid off several of its in house reporters such as Kevin Corke  Jeannie Ohm and Don Teague  This was the largest layoff in NBC News history  After the sudden death of the influential moderator Tim Russert of Meet the Press in June       Tom Brokaw took over as an interim host  and on December           David Gregory became the new moderator of the show until August           when NBC announced that NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd would take over as the   th moderator of Meet the Press starting September          David Gregory s last broadcast was August                   By       NBC had established leadership in network news  airing the highest rated morning  evening  and Sunday interview news programs      Its ability to share costs with MSNBC and share in the cable network s advertising and subscriber revenue made it far more profitable than its network rivals        NBC Nightly News broadcast  March       On March           NBC News broadcast an edited segment from a     call placed by George Zimmerman before he shot Trayvon Martin  The editing made it appear that Zimmerman volunteered that Martin was black  rather than merely responding to the dispatcher s inquiry  which would support a view that the shooting was racially motivated  A media watchdog organization accused NBC News of engaging in  an all out falsehood   While NBC News initially declined to comment      the news agency did issue an apology to viewers      The Washington Post called the statement  skimpy on the details on just how the mistake unfolded       On December           NBC News reporter Richard Engel and his five crew members  Aziz Akyava   Ghazi Balkiz  John Kooistra  Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar  were kidnapped in Syria  Having escaped after five days in captivity  Engel said he believed that a Shabiha group loyal to al Assad was behind the abduction  and that the crew was freed by the Ahrar al Sham group five days later      Engel s account was however challenged from early on      In April       NBC had to revise the kidnapping account  following further investigations by The New York Times  which suggested that the NBC team  was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army   rather than by a loyalist Shia group      In      John Lapinski was Director of Elections  replacing Sheldon Gawiser   In      the election team s decision desk group was given its first permanent space at    Rockefeller  replacing the News Sales Archives that had occupied the space previously      The NBC News Division was the first news team to possess the tape of Donald Trump  recorded by Access Hollywood  after a producer of the NBC show had made the News Division aware of it  the News Division internally debated publishing it for three days  and then an unidentified source gave a copy of the tape to Washington Post Reporter David Fahrenthold  who contacted NBC for comment  notified the Trump campaign that he had the video  obtained confirmation of its authenticity  and released a story and the tape itself  scooping NBC              Alerted that the Post might release the story immediately      NBC News released its own story shortly after the Post story was published           Sexual Misconduct and NBC News edit   Matt Lauer at the      Time     gala  On November           NBC News announced that Matt Lauer s employment had been terminated after an unidentified female NBC employee reported that Lauer had sexually harassed her during the      Winter Olympics in Sochi  Russia  and that the harassment continued after they returned to New York       NBC News management said it had been aware that The New York Times and Variety had been conducting independent investigations of Lauer s behavior      but that management had been unaware of previous allegations against Lauer           Linda Vester  a former NBC News correspondent  disputed the claims that management knew nothing  saying that  everybody knew  that Lauer was dangerous       According to Ronan Farrow  multiple sources have stated that NBC News was not only aware of Lauer s misconduct beforehand  but that Harvey Weinstein used this knowledge to pressure them into killing a story that would have outed his own sexual misconduct          Variety reported allegations by at least ten of Lauer s current and former colleagues      Additional accusations went public in the ensuing days          NBC News President Noah Oppenheim suggested an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein after NBC contributor Ronan Farrow pitched a general idea to report on sexual harassment in Hollywood       After a    month investigation by Farrow and NBC Producer Rich McHugh  NBC chose not to publish it          The story  with very few changes  was published a few weeks later in the New Yorker Magazine instead      A story on the subject of Weinstein s alleged behavior also appeared several days earlier in The New York Times      Following criticism for missing a major story it had initiated  NBC News defended the decision  saying that at the time Farrow was at NBC  the early reporting still had important missing necessary elements      Farrow later disputed this characterization  saying that he had multiple named accusers willing to come forward and that the version ultimately published in the New Yorker had very few changes from the version that NBC News rejected              This version went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in April            A former NBC News executive has said that the story on Weinstein was killed because NBC News was aware of the sexual misconduct by Lauer  in Catch and Kill  Lies  Spies  and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators  Ronan Farrow cites two sources within American Media  Inc stating that the story was killed in response to an overt threat from Weinstein to out Lauer           Presidents edit  Eleven people have served as president of NBC News during its history

a former analog radio network targeted at FM stations  which lasted only from      till       The original major NBC Radio Network would be purchased by Westwood One a decade later  in       as General Electric  which had acquired NBC s parent company RCA  divested most properties not pertaining to the NBC television network  thus ending its direct participation in the radio business  NBC Radio Network s news operation was merged into the Mutual Broadcasting System  then into Westwood One s then corporate sibling CBS Radio  and eventually assimilated into the syndicator itself  For years  Westwood One has carried on syndicating several NBC branded shows to affiliate radio stations  including audio versions of current affairs NBC TV shows such as Meet the Press  a practice that continues to date      As for hard news programming  Westwood One used to provide an homonymous NBC News Radio service  which was initially limited to a feed of one hour reports updated from   a m  to
