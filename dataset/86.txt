       Taika Reform  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search The Taika Reforms          Taika no Kaishin  Reformation of Taika   were a set of doctrines established by Emperor K toku       K toku Tenn   in the year      They were written shortly after the death of Prince Sh toku and the defeat of the Soga clan      Soga no uji   uniting Japan  The reforms also artistically marked the end of the Asuka period and the beginning of the Hakuh  period        Crown Prince Naka no  e  who would later reign as Emperor Tenji   Nakatomi no Kamatari  and Emperor K toku jointly embarked on the details of the Reforms  Emperor K toku then announced the era of  Taika        or  Great Reform   The Reform began with land reform  based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China  but the true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court  which was also based on the governmental structure of China  Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn seemingly everything from the Chinese writing system  literature  religion  and architecture  to even dietary habits at this time  Even today  the impact of the reforms can still be seen in Japanese cultural life   Contents    Background   Reform   See also   References   Further reading   Background edit   Isshi Incident After the regency of Sh toku Tenchi ended the Soga clan  from which Sh toku s ancestry was derived  took hegemony of the Yamato court  The clan was opposed to Sh toku s son Yamashiro  e and killed him in      Under the reign of Empress K gyoku the Soga clan head  Soga no Iruka  was virtually an almighty leader of the court   Those who were against Soga s dictatorship included the emperor s brother Karu  the emperor s son  Prince Naka no  e  along with his friend Nakatomi no Kamatari  and his son in law Soga no Ishikawamaro  Iruka s cousin   They ended Iruka s regime by a coup d  tat in      Isshi Incident   As K gyoku renounced her throne  Karu ascended to be Emperor K toku   The new emperor  together with the Imperial Prince Naka no  e  issued a series of reform measures that culminated in the Taika Reform Edicts in      At this time  two scholars  Takamuko no Kuromaro and priest Min  who had both accompanied Ono no Imoko in travels to Sui Dynasty China  where they stayed for more than a decade   were assigned to the position of Kuni no Hakase       National doctorate   They were likely to take a major part in compiling these edicts which in essence founded the Japanese imperial system and government   The ruler according to these edicts was no longer a clan leader but Emperor  in Japanese  Tenn    who exercised absolute authority  The reform was much inspired by the Japanese missions to China in the Sui and Tang dynasties  and sought to emulate China s system of centralized imperial control and Confucianism     Reform edit  From today s vantage point  the Taika Reform is seen as a coherent system in which a great many inherently dissonant factors have been harmonized  but the changes unfolded in a series of successive steps over the course of many years     The major objective was to reassert imperial authority through reorganizing the government  including abolishing the kabane hereditary title system previously in place     A major reform on the law include the Taih   Great Law  Code written in      consisting of criminal and administrative laws modeled after Tang China  leading to the ritsuyo system     New offices created include that of the Daij  daijin  chancellor   who presided over the Daj kan  Grand Council of State   which included the Minister of the Left  the Minister of the Right  eight central government ministries  and a prestigious Ministry of Deities     Locally  the country was reorganized into    imperial provinces and     counties  with appointed governors     Subjects were to be surveyed  land was to be nationalized and redistributed  and private weapons were to be stored in government armories     A land tax  military service and labor obligations were instituted on subjects     A permanent capital was also established in Nara  emulating the grid system of Tang China s capital Xi an     An exam system was also established  although unlike in China  it was only open to those from noble families     The role of women became much more restricted in Japan  especially in official domains  in emulation of China     The Reform Edicts severely curtailed the independence of regional officials and constituted the imperial court as a place of appeal and complaint about the people  In addition  the last edicts attempted to end certain social practices  in order to bring Japanese society more in line with Chinese social practices  A legal code was enacted  with a reformed bureaucracy and law     Nonetheless  powerful clans continue to exercise power in the imperial court and in regional governments     It would take centuries for the conceptual idea of the Chinese style emperor to take root in Japan     Chinese civilization  including its art  philosophy  literature and architecture  would become much more entrenched in Japan compared to China s system of government      See also edit  Sh en the form of Japanese fiefdom that developed after the Taika Reforms  References edit      Fred S  Kleiner  Christin J  Mamiya
