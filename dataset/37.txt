       History of paper  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search History of paper  Five seminal steps in ancient Chinese papermaking outlined in a woodcut Paper is a thin nonwoven material traditionally made from a combination of milled plant and textile fibres   It is primarily used for writing  artwork  and packaging  it is commonly white  The first papermaking process was documented in China during the Eastern Han period         AD  traditionally attributed to the court official Cai Lun  During the  th century  Chinese papermaking spread to the Islamic world  where pulp mills and paper mills were used for papermaking and money making  By the   th century  papermaking was brought to Europe  By the   th century  papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing waterwheels in Spain  Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the   th century with the invention of wood based papers  Although precursors such as papyrus and amate existed in the Mediterranean world and pre Columbian Americas  respectively  these materials are not defined as true paper     Nor is true parchment considered paper  a  used principally for writing  parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus  In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic  paper  was introduced  as well as paper plastic laminates  paper metal laminates  and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties   Contents    Early writing materials   Paper in China

original structure of the ribbon like strips that make it up  As the papyrus is worked  it tends to break apart along the seams  leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart  The English word  paper  is etymologically derived from papyrus  Ancient Greek for the Cyperus papyrus plant  Papyrus is a thick  paper like material produced from the pith of the Cyperus papyrus plant which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean societies for writing     When used in scrolls  repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again  typically along vertical lines  This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents     Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed  This produces a much more even surface  and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time      Paper in China edit   Earliest known extant paper fragment unearthed at Fangmatan  circa     BCE  Hemp wrapping paper  Western Han period of China  circa     BCE  Oldest paper book  composed of six different materials  circa CE      The world s earliest known printed book  using woodblock printing   the Diamond Sutra of      shows the widespread availability and practicality of paper in China  Main article  Papermaking Further information  Cai Lun   Standardization of paper  and Science and technology of the Han Dynasty Archaeological evidence of papermaking predates the traditional attribution given to Cai Lun     an imperial eunuch official of the Han dynasty      BCE   CE       thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced  The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at Fangmatan in Gansu province  and was likely part of a map  dated to         BCE     Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to    BCE and at Yumen pass  dated to   BCE     The invention traditionally attributed to Cai Lun  recorded hundreds of years after it took place  is dated to     CE  The innovation is a type of paper made of mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishing nets  old rags  and hemp waste which reduced the cost of paper production  which prior to this  and later  in the West  depended solely on rags            Techniques edit  During the Shang            BCE  and Zhou           BCE  dynasties of ancient China  documents were ordinarily written on bone or bamboo  on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls   making them very heavy  awkward  and hard to transport  The light material of silk was sometimes used as a recording medium  but was normally too expensive to consider  The Han dynasty Chinese court official Cai Lun  c         CE  is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking  inspired by wasps and bees  using rags and other plant fibers in     CE     However  the discovery of specimens bearing written Chinese characters in      at Fangmatan in north east China s Gansu Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than     years before Cai  in   BCE  and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early  nd century BCE     It therefore would appear that  Cai Lun s contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically  fix a recipe for papermaking      Cai Lun s biography in the Twenty Four Histories says      In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih  But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use  Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees  remnants of hemp  rags of cloth and fishing nets  He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan Hsing      CE  and received praise for his ability  From this time  paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai  The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water  after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat  The bark of paper mulberry was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of tan     sandalwood   In the Eastern Jin period a fine bamboo screen mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking  After printing was popularized during the Song dynasty the demand for paper grew substantially  In the year           million sheets of paper were sent to the capital      Uses edit  Open  it stretches  closed  it rolls up  it can be contracted or expanded  hidden away or displayed      Fu Xian Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han from the  nd century BCE      Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous  medicine  were involved  as mentioned in the official history of the period      Although paper was used for writing by the  rd century CE      paper continued to be used for wrapping  and other  purposes  Toilet paper was used in China from around the late  th century      In      the Chinese scholar official Yan Zhitui           wrote   Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from Five Classics or the names of sages  I dare not use for toilet purposes       An Arab traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in      writing        the Chinese  do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities  but they only wipe themselves with paper       During the Tang dynasty           paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea  In the same period  it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape      During the Song dynasty            the government produced the world s first known paper printed money  or banknote  see Jiaozi and Huizi   Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper envelopes      During the Yuan dynasty              the first well documented Europeans in Medieval China  the Venetian merchant Marco Polo remarked how the Chinese burned paper effigies shaped as male and female servants  camels  horses  suits of clothing and armor while cremating the dead during funerary rites       Impact of paper edit  According to Timothy Hugh Barrett  paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture  and a  strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction  despite political fragmentation       Indeed  the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world  It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles  but in their entirety  Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart  As a result  individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries      Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early  th century  with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls  In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total      By the early  th century  scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of     sources in commentaries on older works      A small compilation text from the  th century included citations to over       works      The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late  th century imperial librarian  According to him  the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man      According to Endymion Wilkinson  one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that  it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production      During the Tang dynasty  China became the world leader in book production  In addition the gradual spread of woodblock printing from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world       From the fourth century CE to about       the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe  The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about       to       titles         juan  in      The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to       to       titles  These are indeed impressive numbers  but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted  Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles  a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe        Endymion Wilkinson However  despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium  by the  th century its spread and development in the Middle East had closed the gap between the two regions  Between the  th to early   th centuries  libraries in Cairo  Baghdad  and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China  and dwarfed those in Europe  From about      the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese  The Venetian Domenico Grimani s collection numbered        volumes by the time of his death in       After       European collections completely overtook those in China  The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered        volumes in      and surged to         in       In the     s the Biblioth que du Roi numbered        books and the Cambridge University        in       After       libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China  and toward the end of the century  Thomas Jefferson s private collection numbered       titles in       volumes  The European advantage only increased further into the   th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections  such as that of Lord Acton  reached              European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century  Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China  but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China       Endymion Wilkinson Paper became central to the three arts of China   poetry  painting  and calligraphy  In later times paper constituted one of the  Four Treasures of the Scholar s Studio   alongside the brush  the ink  and the inkstone       Paper in Asia and Africa edit  See also  Dunhuang manuscripts After its origin in central China  the production and use of paper spread steadily  It is clear that paper was used at Dunhuang by     CE  in Loulan in the modern day province of Xinjiang by      and in Turpan by       Paper was concurrently introduced in Japan sometime between the years     and           Eastern Asia edit  Paper spread to Vietnam in the  rd century  to Korea in the  th century  and to Japan in the  th century  The paper of Korea was famed for being glossy white and was especially prized for painting and calligraphy  It was among the items commonly sent to China as tribute  The Koreans spread paper to Japan possibly as early as the  th century but the Buddhist monk Damjing s trip to Japan in     is often cited as the official beginning of papermaking there       Islamic world edit   Paper page fragment from a Coptic language Bible from Egypt in the Islamic period   th century or later  Origin edit  Paper was used in Central Asia by the  th century but its origin is not clear  According to the   th century historian  Thaalibi  Chinese prisoners captured at the Battle of Talas in     introduced paper manufacturing to Samarkand          However there are no contemporary Arab sources for this battle  A Chinese prisoner  Du Huan  who later returned to China reported weavers  painters  goldsmiths  and silversmiths among the prisoners taken  but no papermakers  According to Al Nadim  a writer in Baghdad  Chinese craftsmen made paper in Khorasan       Then there is the Khurasani paper made of flax  which some say appeared in the days of the Umayyads  while others say it was during the Abbasid regime  Some say that it was an ancient product and others say that it is recent  It is stated that craftsmen from China made it in Khurasan in the form of Chinese paper       Al Nadim According to Jonathan Bloom   a scholar of Islamic and Asian Art with a focus on paper and printing  the connection between Chinese prisoners and the introduction of paper in Central Asia is  unlikely to be factual   Archaeological evidence shows that paper was already known and used in Samarkand decades before     CE  Seventy six texts in Sogdian  Arabic  and Chinese have also been found near Panjakent  likely predating the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana  Bloom argues that based on differences in Chinese and Central Asian papermaking techniques and materials  the story of Chinese papermakers directly introducing paper to Central Asia is probably metaphorical  Chinese paper was mostly made of bast fibers while Islamic paper was primarily made of waste material like rags          The paper making innovations in Central Asia may be pre Islamic  probably aided by the Buddhist merchants and monks of China and Central Asia  The Islamic civilization helped spread paper and paper making into the Middle East after the  th century  from where it arrived into Europe centuries later  and then to many other parts of the world  A historical remnant of this legacy is the continued use of the word  ream  to count bundles of paper  a word derived from Arabic rizma  bundle  bale        Shift from parchment to paper edit  During the  th century  paper started to replace parchment as the primary writing material for administrative uses in Baghdad  the capital of Abbasids  According to Ibn Khaldun  a renowned Muslim historiographer  parchment was rare  and a great increase in the number of correspondents throughout Islamic territories  resulted in an order issued by Al Fadl ibn Yahya  the Abbasid s Grand Vizier  for the manufacture of paper to replace parchment      There are records of paper being made at Gilgit in Pakistan by the sixth century  in Samarkand by      in Baghdad by      in Egypt by      and in Fes  Morocco around       in Syria e g  Damascus  and Aleppo  in Andalusia around   th century  in Persia e g  Maragheh by   th century  Isfahan by   th century  Ghazvin and Kerman  in India e g  Dowlat Abad by the   th century      A Persian geography book written by an unknown author in the   th century  Hodud al Alam  is the oldest known manuscripts mentioning papermaking industry in Samarkand  The writer stated that the city was famous for paper manufacturing and the product was exported to many other cities as a high quality item      Samarkand kept its reputation for papermaking over few centuries even once the industry spread across other Islamic areas  For instance  it is said that some Ministers in Egypt preferred ordering their required paper to Samarkand from which the paper was transported all the way to Egypt      In Baghdad  particular neighbourhoods were allocated to paper manufacturing      and in Bazaar paper merchants and sellers owned distinct sectors being called Paper Market or Suq al Warraqin  a street which was lined with more than     paper and booksellers  shops      The expansion of public and private libraries and illustrated books within Islamic lands was one of the notable outcomes of a drastic increase in the availability of paper      However  paper was still considered a valuable good given the remarkable required input e g  primary materials and labourers to produce the item in the absence of advanced mechanical machinery   In one case Ibn al Bawwab  a Persian calligrapher and illuminator  had been promised by the Sultan to be given precious garments in response to his services  Once the Sultan deferred delivering the promised clothes  he instead proposed the option of taking the papers stored in the Sultan s library as his present       In another example  the hospitality of a Minister in Baghdad  Ibn Al Forat  had been described by his generosity in freely handing out papers to his guests or visitors       Types of paper edit  A wide range of paper types with different properties and place of origins were manufactured and utilised in Islamic lands  Paper varieties were named based on several criteria    Origins  e g Isfahani  Baghdadi  Halabi  Mesri  Samarkandi  Dowlat Abadi  Shami  Charta Damascena   Sizes  Solsan  Nesfi     And sometimes people who have supported the product  e g  Nuhi  Talhi  Jafari  Mamuni  Mansouri       Paper primary materials edit  Bast  hemp and flax   cotton  and old rags and ropes were the major input materials for producing the pulp  Sometimes a mixture of materials was also used for pulp making  such as cotton and hemp  or flax and hemp          Other uncommon primary materials such as fig tree bark are also reported in some manuscripts       Papermaking process edit  Unfortunately  very few manuscripts mentioned the methods of papermaking  the phases and applied devices  But a stunning painting from an illustrated book in Persian has implicated different steps and devices of the traditional process of paper making which is astonishingly in line with few extant documents describing the paper manufacturing process  In this painting two major phases of papermaking have been separately illustrated   Pulp making and pulp dewatering  water power mill mixes linen wastes  Karbas  and rags  as the primary materials of papermaking  with water  They are well beaten in stone pits  In the next step  the watery pulp is poured into a piece of fabric  tied around two workers  waists  to get initially dewatered and probably homogenised and purified  Once the pulp is dewatered into a considerable extent it passes through the next treatment phase  Paper final treatments  this phase consists of several consequent steps e g moulding the pulp with a square laid with wire like lines  dipping the mould in the vat containing pulp   pressing  sizing  drying and polishing  Each step in this phase is undertaken by a particular device  For instance  in the drying process  the paper was stuck to the wall with the use of horsehair   Traditional paper making process Oriental Paper A highly valuable manuscript from the   th century has also elaborated the process of papermaking in detailed  This text shows how papermakers went through a multitude of steps to produce a high quality paper  This papermaking instruction or recipe is a chapter under the title of al k ghad al balad   local paper  from the manuscript of al Mukhtara f  fun n min al  unan attributed to al Malik al Mu affar  a Yemeni ruler of Rasulids  The bark of fig trees  as the main source of papermaking in this recipe  went through frequent cycles of soaking  beating and drying  The whole process that took    days was designed to produced     sheets of high quality paper   During the pulping stage  the beaten fibres were transformed into different sizes of Kubba  cubes  which they were used as standard scales to manufacture a certain number of sheets  The dimensions were determined based on three citrus fruit  limun  lemon   utrunja  orange  and narenja  Tangerine   A summarized version of this detailed process is as below  Each procedure was repeated several times   Soaking paper in a pool Dewatering paper through squeezing and pressing Making balls from the pulp Pressing the balls Drying the paper by sticking them to the wall and exposing the final product into the sun     Paper properties edit  Near Eastern paper is mainly characterized by sizing with a variety of starches such as rice  katira  wheat and white sorghum  Rice and white sorghum were more widely used          Paper usually was placed on a hard surface and a smooth device called a mohreh was used to rub the starch against the paper until it becomes perfectly shiny      The laborious process of papermaking was refined and machinery was designed for bulk manufacturing of paper  Production began in Baghdad  where a method was invented to make a thicker sheet of paper  which helped transform papermaking from an art into a major industry      The use of water powered pulp mills for preparing the pulp material used in papermaking dates back to Samarkand in the  th century      The use of human animal powered paper mills has also been identified in Abbasid era Baghdad during              though this should not be confused with later water powered paper mills  see Paper mills section below   The Muslims also introduced the use of trip hammers  human  or animal powered  in the production of paper  replacing the traditional Chinese mortar and pestle method  In turn  the trip hammer method was later employed by the Chinese      Historically  trip hammers were often powered by a water wheel  and are known to have been used in China as long ago as    BCE or maybe even as far back as the Zhou Dynasty       BCE     BCE       though the trip hammer is not known to have been used in Chinese papermaking until after its use in Muslim papermaking      Apart from large scale and more mechanized paper manufacturers  small to medium sized manufacturers had labour intensive papermaking processes By the  th century  Muslims were using paper regularly  although for important works like copies of the revered Qur an  vellum was still preferred      Advances in book production and bookbinding were introduced      unreliable source  In Muslim countries they made books lighter sewn with silk and bound with leather covered paste boards  they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use  As paper was less reactive to humidity  the heavy boards were not needed  By the   th century in Marrakech in Morocco a street was named  Kutubiyyin  or book sellers which contained more than     bookshops      In      a Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo noted that vegetables  spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold      Since the First Crusade in       paper manufacturing in Damascus had been interrupted by wars  but its production continued in two other centres  Egypt continued with the thicker paper  while Iran became the center of the thinner papers  Papermaking was diffused across the Islamic world  from where it was diffused further west into Europe      Paper manufacture was introduced to India in the   th century by Arab merchants  where it almost wholly replaced traditional writing materials       Indian subcontinent edit  The Weber manuscripts  above  were discovered in Kucha  Xinjiang China   now preserved in the Bodleian Library  Oxford   They are a collection of   manuscript fragments  originally created on paper  and dated to the  th  to  th century CE  Four were on Nepalese origin paper  Above  upper  off white   others on Central Asian paper  lower  brown   Eight in good Sanskrit language written in two scripts  one in grammatically poor  mixed Sanskrit and Pali          The evidence of paper use on the Indian subcontinent appears first in the second half of the  th century          Its use is mentioned by  th  and  th century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim memoirs as well as some Indian Buddhists  as Kakali and  aya   likely Indian transliteration of Chinese Zh   tsie           Yijing wrote about the practice of priests and laypeople in India printing Buddha image on silk or paper  and worshipping these images  Elsewhere in his memoir  I Ching wrote that Indians use paper to make hats  to reinforce their umbrellas and for sanitation      Xuangzang mentions carrying     manuscripts from India back to China in     CE  but it is unclear if any of these were on paper      Thin sheets of birch bark and specially treated palm leaves remained the preferred writing surface for literary works through late medieval period in most of India      The earliest Sanskrit paper manuscript found is a paper copy of the Shatapatha Brahmana in Kashmir  dated to       while the earliest Sanskrit paper manuscripts in Gujarat are dated between      and           Some of oldest surviving paper manuscripts have been found in Jain temples of Gujarat and Rajasthan  and paper use by Jain scribes is traceable to around   th century      According to the historical trade related archives such as Cairo Geniza found in the synagogues of the Middle East  Jewish merchants   such as Ben Yiju originally from Tunisia who moved to India   imported large quantities of paper into ports of Gujarat  Malabar coast and other parts of India by the   th century to partly offset the goods they exported from India          According to Irfan Habib  it is reasonable to presume that paper manufacturing reached Sindh  now part of south Pakistan  before   th century with the start of Arab rule in Sindh      Fragments of Arabic manuscripts found in the Sindhi city ruins of Mansura  which was destroyed circa       confirm the use of paper in Sindh      Amir Khusrau of Delhi Sultanate mentions paper making operations in           In the   th century  Chinese traveler Ma Huan praised the quality of paper in Bengal  describing it as white paper that is made from  bark of a tree  and is as  glossy and smooth as deer s skin       The use of tree bark as a raw material for paper suggests that the paper manufacturing in the eastern states of India may have come directly from China  rather than Sultanates formed by West Asian or Central Asian conquests      Paper technology likely arrived in India from China through Tibet and Nepal around mid  th century  when Buddhist monks freely traveled  exchanged ideas and goods between Tibet and Buddhist centers in India      This exchange is evidenced by the Indian talapatra binding methods that were adopted by Chinese monasteries such as at Tunhuang for preparing sutra books from paper  Most of the earliest surviving sutra books in Tibetan monasteries are on Chinese paper strips held together with Indian manuscript binding methods      Further  the analysis of the woodblock book covers of these historic manuscripts has confirmed that it was made of tropical wood indigenous to India  not Tibet       Paper in Europe edit   A copy of the Gutenberg Bible  printed on paper during the     s  in the New York Public Library The oldest known paper document in Europe is the Mozarab Missal of Silos from the   th century      probably using paper made in the Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula  They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber  The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in X tiva in               Papermaking reached Europe as early as      in Toledo and was firmly established in X tiva  Spain by        It is clear that France had a paper mill by       and by      mills were established in Fabriano  Italy and in Treviso and other northern Italian towns by        Papermaking then spread further northwards  with evidence of paper being made in Troyes  France by       in Holland sometime around            in Mainz  Germany in       and in Nuremberg by      in a mill set up by Ulman Stromer      This was just about the time when the woodcut printmaking technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the old master print and popular prints  There was a paper mill in Switzerland by      and the first mill in England was set up by John Tate around      near Hertford          but the first commercially successful paper mill in Britain did not occur before      when John Spilman set up a mill near Dartford in Kent       During this time  paper making spread to Poland by       to Austria by       to Russia by       to the Netherlands by       to Denmark by       and to Sweden by           Arab prisoners who settled in a town called Borgo Saraceno in the Italian Province of Ferrara introduced Fabriano artisans in the Province of Ancona clarification needed  the technique of making paper by hand   At the time they were renowned for their wool weaving and manufacture of cloth   Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time   They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper  sizing paper by means of animal glue  and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process  The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper  it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local tanneries  The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper      They adapted the waterwheels from the fuller s mills to drive a series of three wooden hammers per trough   The hammers were raised by their heads by cams fixed to a waterwheel s axle made from a large tree trunk           Americas edit   Amate is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture  In the Americas  archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark paper writing material was used by the Maya no later than the  th century CE      Called amatl or amate  it was in widespread use among Mesoamerican cultures until the Spanish conquest  The earliest sample of amate was found at Huitzilapa near the Magdalena Municipality  Jalisco  Mexico  belonging to the shaft tomb culture  It is dated to    BCE      The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus  The bark material is soaked in water  or in modern methods boiled  so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres  They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets  It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form  but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers  As a result  amate has a rougher surface than modern paper  and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink  European papermaking spread to the Americas first in Mexico by      and then in Philadelphia by            United States edit  The American paper industry began with the establishment of the first paper mill in British America in      by William Rittenhouse of Philadelphia with the help of Pennsylvania s first printer  William Bradford  For two decades it would remain the only mill in the colonies  and for the next two centuries the city would remain the preeminent center of paper manufacturing and publishing  The first paper mills relied solely on rag paper production  with cotton rags generally imported from Europe  However by the mid   th century the sulfite process had begun to proliferate in other regions with better access to wood pulp  and by       America had become the largest producer of paper goods in the world  While the Delaware Valley remained an important region in paper production and publishing through the late nineteenth century  Philadelphia was overtaken by regions using these new processes which had greater access to water power and wood pulp      The earliest of these mills were centered in New England and Upstate New York  the latter of which became home to International Paper  the largest pulp and paper company in the world  which held a     market share in           and at its peak produced more than     of the continent s newsprint in       before an industry shift to Canada      Chief among papermaking cities in New England and the world was Holyoke  Massachusetts  at one time

it is still called  produced     tons per day  more than twice Philadelphia s capacity      Quickly it became a hub of paper machinery and turbine technology  host to the largest paper mills in the world in the     s  and D  H    A  B  Tower  the largest paper mill engineering firm in the United States in the   th century      The Tower Brothers and their associates would be responsible for designing mills on five continents      In the United States the firm supported the Berkshires  paper industry  building the first mills used to make U S  currency by the Crane Company  as well as the first sulfite process mills of Kimberly Clark in Wisconsin  allowing the company to be the first west of the Appalachians to adopt the process  with access to vast forest resources          The pulp and paper industry continued to develop in other regions  including California  Ohio s Miami Valley  with centers in Dayton  Hamilton  and Cincinnati  as well as regions of the South  like Texas and Georgia  the latter being home to Georgia Pacific and WestRock  the  nd and  rd respective largest paper producers in the United States today          Wisconsin s industry nevertheless endured and as of      it had far and away the most paper manufacturers in the country  with    such enterprises  While only smaller specialty manufacturers remained in Pennsylvania and New England  New York retained    mills  followed by Georgia with     Michigan with     and Alabama with    respectively       Paper mills edit  Main article  Paper mill  The Nuremberg paper mill  the building complex at the lower right corner  in       Due to their noise and smell  paper mills were required by medieval law to be erected outside the city perimeter  The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim papermakers  However  evidence for water powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the   th century                  Scholars have identified paper mills  likely human or animal powered  in Abbasid era Baghdad during               It is evident that throughout the Islamic lands e g  Iran  Syria  Hama and Damascus   and North Africa  Egypt and Tripoli  water power mills were extensively used to beat the flax and rag wastes to prepare the paper pulp        The Water mill was built under Abd al Rahman II in C rdoba Donald Hill has identified a possible reference to a water powered paper mill in Samarkand  in the   th century work of the Persian scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni  but concludes that the passage is  too brief to enable us to say with certainty  that it refers to a water powered paper mill      This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper  but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time      Burns remains sceptical  given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the   th century      Clear evidence of a water powered paper mill dates to      in the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon      A decree by the Christian king Peter III addresses the establishment of a royal  molendinum   a proper hydraulic mill  in the paper manufacturing centre of X tiva      The crown innovation was operated by the Muslim Mud jar community in the Moorish quarter of X tiva      though it appears to have been resented by sections of the local Muslim papermakering community  the document guarantees them the right to continue the way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill      Paper making centers began to multiply in the late   th century in Italy  reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further  paper making centers reached Germany a century later      The first paper mill north of the Alps was established in Nuremberg by Ulman Stromer in       it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated Nuremberg Chronicle      From the mid   th century onwards  European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes       Fiber sources edit  Main article  Cotton paper Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles  called rags  The rags were from hemp  linen and cotton      It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in      that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers      It was not realized at the time how unstable wood pulp paper is  A means of removing printing inks from paper  allowing it to be re used  was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in           Today this process is called deinking     th century advances in papermaking edit  Although cheaper than vellum  paper remained expensive  at least in book sized quantities  through the centuries  until the advent of steam driven paper making machines in the   th century  which could make paper with fibres from wood pulp  Although older machines pre dated it  the Fourdrinier papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking  Nicholas Louis Robert of Essonnes  France  was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in       At the time he was working for Leger Didot with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention  Didot sent his brother in law  John Gamble  to meet Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier  stationers of London  who agreed to finance the project  Gamble was granted British patent      on    October       With the help particularly of Bryan Donkin  a skilled and ingenious mechanic  an improved version of the Robert original was installed at Frogmore Paper Mill  Hertfordshire  in       followed by another in       A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers  own mill at Two Waters  The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at St Neots intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop  However  experiments with wood showed no real results in the late   th century and at the start of the   th century  By       Matthias Koops  in London  England  further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper  and in      he wrote and published a book titled Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events  and to convey ideas  from the earliest date  to the invention of paper       His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings  and adhered together   No pages were fabricated using the pulping method  from either rags or wood   He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business  But his enterprise was short lived  Only a few years following his first and only printed book  the one he wrote and printed   he went bankrupt  The book was very well done  strong and had a fine appearance   but it was very costly                 Then in the     s and     s  two men on two different continents took up the challenge  but from a totally new perspective  Both Friedrich Gottlob Keller and Charles Fenerty began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making  instead of pulping rags  they thought about pulping wood  And at about the same time  by mid       they announced their findings  They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood  exactly as with rags  and made paper from it  Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white  This started a new era for paper making  By the end of the   th century almost all printers in the western world were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper       Together with the invention of the practical fountain pen and the mass produced pencil of the same period  and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary printing press  wood based paper caused a major transformation of the   th century economy and society in industrialized countries  With the introduction of cheaper paper  schoolbooks  fiction  non fiction  and newspapers became gradually available by       Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so  by       the clerk  or writer  ceased to be a high status job  Unfortunately  early wood based paper deteriorated as time passed  meaning that much of the output of newspapers and books from this period either has disintegrated or is in poor condition  some has been photographed or digitized  scanned   The acid nature of the paper  caused by the use of alum  produced what has been called a slow fire  slowly converting the paper to ash  Documents needed to be written on more expensive rag paper  In the  nd half of the   th century cheaper acid free paper based on wood was developed  and it was used for hardback and trade paperback books  However  paper that has not been de acidified was still cheaper  and remains in use        for mass market paperback books  newspapers  and in underdeveloped countries   Determining provenance edit  Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways   The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar   Using known sheets can produce an exact identification   Next  comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results   Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process   Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location       page needed   See also edit     Wikimedia Commons has
