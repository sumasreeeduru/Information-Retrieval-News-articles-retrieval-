strategically combining words and images to convey information   Contents    Universal   Meaning is suggested   Projects   Further reading   See also   External links   Universal edit  Visual journalism is premised upon the idea that at a time of accelerating change  often words cannot keep pace with concepts  Visual journalism incorporates ancient symbols that resonate with humans across cultures and time and conveys meaning instantaneously at a deep level  Visual journalism is an outgrowth of the practice of graphic facilitation and recording that began entering corporate board rooms  conferences  and think tank meetings in the     s with the leadership of David Sibbet  founder of The Grove Consultants International  But its roots date back to ancient cave paintings and carry forward in the work of designers  architects  and engineers  Only recently has interactive visualization of this sort moved out into common use in a variety of group engagements  The scholarly father of this visual form of communication is Robert Horn  Ph D   a fellow at Stanford University and author of the book Visual Language   Meaning is suggested edit  Visual journalism is not a series of symbols with precise meanings but rather images that suggest complex meanings and  in the Egyptian tradition of the cartouche  contain words  The symbols do not simply represent but participate in the meaning and  in combination with evocative phrases  are designed to provoke creative thinking  Visual language is one tool described by author Daniel Pink in his book A Whole New Mind for the emerging  conceptual age  where people must tolerate ambiguity and communicate quickly  often before concepts are ready to be captured in traditional writing   Projects edit         People s Republic of
