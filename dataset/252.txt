         Virgin Radio launch and early years edit   No   Golden Square with  Virgin Radio  branding               The Broadcasting Act      allowed for the launch of independent national radio  INR  stations in the United Kingdom     The Radio Authority was mandated to award three INR licences  one of which  INR   had to be for a  non pop  station  which was awarded to Classic FM   and one of which had to be for a predominantly speech based service  this would be advertised later as INR  and would be awarded to Talk Radio   The remaining licence was to be open to  all comers   The licences were to be awarded to the highest cash bidder  providing that the applicant met criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act     The second national licence  INR   would take over the      kHz and      kHz frequencies  which were to be relinquished by BBC Radio       The licence was advertised in October         and five organisations bid  the Independent National Broadcasting Company of Sheffield  which bid            per year  a TV am Virgin consortium               Chiltern Radio s       Radio               Radio Clyde s Score Radio             and a consortium of CLT  Harvey Goldsmith and RT                 The TV am Virgin consortium was awarded the licence in April       after the Radio Authority said that it was not satisfied that Independent National Broadcasting would be able to sustain the service     Later that year  TV am lost its ITV franchise    and its stake in the radio station was sold in March         to Apax Partners  JP Morgan Investment Corporation and Sir David Frost        The station launched as Virgin      at       pm on    April           The original line up of DJs included Richard Skinner  Russ Williams  Jono Coleman  Mitch Johnson  Graham Dene  Nick Abbot  Wendy Lloyd  Tommy Vance  Emperor Rosko and Dave Fanning  Chris Evans was also hired to present a Saturday morning show  following his success at BBC GLR in the weekend mid morning slot  The Show  The Big Red Mug Show was sponsored by Nescafe  The first song was a cover version of the Steppenwolf song  Born to be Wild   recorded by Australian group INXS  Richard Branson was the first voice to be heard  live from the Virgin Megastore in Manchester  with Richard Skinner the first voice back in the London studios      Skinner was also programme director  a role he shared with John Revell      John Pearson was launch sales director  a role he had previously held at LBC   Andy Mollett was launch finance director  David Campbell  previously managing director of one of Virgin s post production television companies      was the chief executive at launch     From before its launch on AM  Virgin Radio was campaigning for a national FM network  Initially  it lobbied for Radio   s FM network to be made available     and then  when the Radio Authority launched a consultation on the use of the         MHz band      it lobbied for it to be set aside as a national network      The Radio Authority decided  however  that         MHz would be licensed to new local and regional stations     and Virgin Radio applied for     and won one of the new FM licences advertised in London as a result      Virgin Radio launched on       MHz FM in London on    April          beginning with a message from broadcaster David Frost at   am followed by the Russ  n  Jono breakfast show  Part of the licence requirements for the London service meant that a daily London opt out was broadcast on FM  presented initially by Rowland Rivron      Within a year  Virgin Group was considering the next steps for the radio station  including the option of a flotation     or buying back the shares of JP Morgan  Apax and Sir David Frost     In May       it was announced that Capital Radio had agreed to acquire Virgin Radio in an     million deal      Capital s plans included moving Virgin Radio from   Golden Square to Capital s Leicester Square building and splitting programming between the AM and FM services      The Radio Authority approved the acquisition      but Nigel Griffiths  the Consumer Affairs Minister  referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission  MMC       The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January       and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin s London FM licence was left out of the deal      However  the delay in approval of the Capital acquisition would ultimately lead to the deal not going through  In January       Chris Evans had left his role as presenter of the Radio   breakfast show as a result of a disagreement between him and the programme controller Matthew Bannister  Evans had asked for Fridays off to allow more time for him to work on his Channel   television show  TFI Friday           Evans was keen to return to radio     and it had been reported that his agent  Michael Foster  had approached Matthew Bannister to ask if Evans would be allowed to be return to Radio        and he had gone as far as commencing negotiations to buy Talk Radio      Richard Branson wanted Evans to work for Virgin Radio  so much so that he joined him on a Concorde flight to New York to try to persuade him to join as the drive time presenter          In the end  Virgin Radio hired Evans to present the breakfast show  replacing the incumbent Russ  n  Jono show  presented by Russ Williams and Jonathan Coleman   His show started on    October       the same day that Zo  Ball started as Evans  replacement on Radio        The initial contract would only be for    weeks  until the MMC announced its decision on the Capital Radio takeover      Evans approached David Campbell to discuss buying the radio station and  with Michael Foster s help  they put together a deal to buy it with venture capital supplied by Apax Partners and Paribas  with Virgin Group retaining a     stake in the business      The deal was announced on   December       and would see the formation of the Ginger Media Group  an umbrella company overseeing Virgin Radio and producing programmes such as TFI Friday                      The Ginger Media Group edit  Evans  ownership of Virgin Radio started well  with a breakfast show audience increase of         to    m in his first three months      In August       Chris Evans took a spur of the moment decision one weekend to launch a Saturday afternoon show called Rock  n  Roll Football  a show that is still broadcast on Absolute Radio      From   October       Virgin Radio started simulcasts of the breakfast show on Sky One each morning for an hour between      and      am  When a track was played on the radio  viewers would see a video at the same time          The start of the new football season in August      saw Terry Venables join Russ Williams in a show that would precede Rock  n  Roll Football      At the end of       in response to the TV programme Who Wants To Be A Millionaire not having given away its top prize  Virgin Radio set a broadcasting first when Clare Barwick won    million at the culmination of  Someone s Going To Be A Millionaire           The management team at the Ginger Media Group were considering expansion opportunities  including a plan to acquire the Daily Star newspaper from United News   Media  and hire Piers Morgan to edit it  Their plans were stalled  however  when the shareholders got cold feet  Evans wrote in his autobiography that  the management wanted to stick to our original brief of expansion  whereas our investors only cared about extracting the added value                   SMG ownership edit  The management team therefore set itself on a strategy to sell the business three years ahead of schedule      It hired Goldman Sachs to run the sale process  and considered a public flotation      before selling to the Scottish Media Group  now STV Group plc  for      million in March       The Scottish Media Group  which owned Scottish Television and the Herald newspaper  fought off other bidders including Clear Channel  NRJ and Guardian Media  Evans personally made     million out of the sale      Evans was subsequently fired by his new employer in      for failing to report into work for five consecutive days while reportedly partying with his then wife Billie Piper      Chief executive John Pearson  who had been with the station since before launch  resigned in April           and was replaced by Fru Hazlitt  who had previously been managing director of Yahoo  UK and Ireland      On    June       SMG plc signed a deal with YooMedia to make Virgin Radio available on Freeview  It has always placed a great emphasis on other methods of transmission than medium wave  as the      kHz frequency suffers from considerable interference  particularly after dark   BBC Radio    which used      kHz for its first    years on air  moved to higher quality medium wave frequencies  now used by talkSport  in      mainly for this reason              Acquisition by Times of India and rebranding as Absolute Radio edit   No   Golden Square with Absolute Radio branding On    April       it was announced that SMG plc was to sell Virgin Radio  to enable the company to focus on its television station  STV      On    May      SMG sold Virgin Radio to TIML Golden Square Limited  a subsidiary of The Times Group for       million  with     million set aside for rebranding  TIML was given    days grace in which to rebrand the station   As part of the deal  Absolute Radio International  operator of two FM licences in Oxford  would manage the station          On   September      it was announced that Virgin Radio would be rebranded as Absolute Radio at the end of the month     September       At the same time  changes to the line up were made known with JK and Joel  Robin Burke  Tony Hadley and John Osborne leaving the station and Allan Lake  Joanna Russell  of Trent FM s Jo   Twiggy  and Tim Shaw joining      though Osborne would return shortly after  The last song to be played on Virgin Radio was  American Pie  by Don McLean and the first to be played on Absolute Radio was  A Day in the Life  by The Beatles      However  listening figures for the final quarter of      showed that almost     of former Virgin Radio listeners had been lost since the rebranding to Absolute Radio      The Virgin Radio brand  however  relaunched via DAB and online on    March       following a new partnership with Wireless Group and approval of its digital terrestrial commercial radio licence by Ofcom in March             present  Acquisition by Bauer Media edit  On    July       Bauer Media Group announced it intended to purchase Absolute from current owner  The Times Group for an amount believed to be between    m    m  pending regulatory approval of the sale      The deal was cleared by the Office of Fair Trading on    December      Subsequently  by September       all other London based Bauer stations permanently moved from Mappin House to a refurbished One Golden Square  creating a new national radio hub  Owner Bauer Radio announced in July      that Absolute Radio would be taking up the       FM frequency in the West Midlands  previously held by Planet Rock  Absolute launched on       FM on   September           However the station ended transmission on that frequency on    December      following Bauer s decision to broadcast Greatest Hits Radio on FM across the West Midlands   Programming edit  Audience and playlist edit  Virgin Radio launched aiming at a target group of     to    year olds     and with a focus on album music  arguing that  singles chart shows on Radio   and local commercial radio were outdated because albums outsold singles by three to one       It would provide a blend of recent album tracks and chart music from the past    years and aim to fill the  hole in the middle  between BBC Radio   and local commercial radio  which was specifically aimed at young audiences and  gold  stations offering classic hits      A year after launch  David Campbell was quoted as saying that  the music policy was wrong  even though Virgin had lots of research to suggest it was doing what listeners said they wanted  We did something we should never do  pursue critical acclaim  playing obscure tracks  gaining the praise of the music press   The station s approach had been to mix in more familiar music      Fru Hazlitt  when interviewed for The Guardian in September       described the type of music the station championed   It s pretty much mainstream rock festival type music  Razorlight  Keane  These bands are becoming some of the biggest in the world       When announcing the rebrand as Absolute Radio on the One Golden Square blog  Clive Dickens  chief operating officer  noted that the station would be  sticking with real music   not manufactured rubbish   and we re building on the amount of live music we do   we re just going to discover more of all of it       The music policy continues to focus on guitar based rock  mostly British  In a blog post in February       Head of Music James Curran noted that the    most played artists in the first four months of Absolute Radio had been  Manic Street Preachers  Coldplay  Arctic Monkeys  Snow Patrol  Kings of Leon  The Killers  Oasis  Travis  U   Placebo  Suede  Kaiser Chiefs  Kasabian  Queen  Keane
