archdiocese in the United States  Two thirds of the Mexican or  New Spain  settlers were mestizo or mulatto  a mixture of African  indigenous and European ancestry      The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades  but by       the population had increased to about     residents      Today  the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street

to more than              putting pressure on the city s water supply      The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in       under the supervision of William Mulholland  ensured the continued growth of the city      Because of clauses in the city s charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders  many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to annex themselves into Los Angeles              Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States  On September           the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones  The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type  where industrial uses were prohibited  The proscriptions included barns  lumber yards  and any industrial land use employing machine powered equipment  These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact  These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances  These included explosives warehousing  gas works  oil drilling  slaughterhouses  and tanneries  Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city  However  between      and       Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones  and as a consequence  some industrial uses emerged within them  There are two differences from the      Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States  First  the      laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the      New York City Zoning Ordinance did  Second  the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing  it treated apartments  hotels  and detached single family housing equally        Hill Street  looking north from  th Street  c        Notable sites include Central Park  today s Pershing Square   the trees

produced in one year than in all the pre war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in       combined  Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed  and as William S  Knudsen  of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it   We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production  the like of which he had never seen  nor dreamed possible       In the     s     s

west  The perimeter of the city is     miles      km   Los Angeles is both flat and hilly  The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens at       ft        m           located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley  The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley  Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt  Washington area north of Downtown  eastern parts such as Boyle Heights  the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills  and the San Pedro district  Surrounding the city are much higher mountains  Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains  which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos  Its high point is Mount San Antonio  locally known as Mount Baldy  which reaches        feet        m   Further afield  the highest point in the Greater Los Angeles area is San Gorgonio Mountain  with a height of        feet        m   The Los Angeles River  which is largely seasonal  is the primary drainage channel  It was straightened and lined in    miles     km  of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel      The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city  flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains  and turns south through the city center  flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean  The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey   Vegetation  Oldest palm tree in Los Angeles       Los Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats  including beaches  wetlands  and mountains  The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub  chaparral shrubland  and riparian woodland      Native plants include  the California poppy  matilija poppy  toyon  Ceanothus  Chamise  Coast Live Oak  sycamore  willow and Giant Wildrye  Many of these native species  such as the Los Angeles sunflower  have become so rare as to be considered endangered  Although it is not native to the area  the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree  Erythrina caffra      and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise  Strelitzia reginae       Mexican Fan Palms  Canary Island Palms  Queen Palms  Date Palms  and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area  although only the last is native   Geology Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire  The geologic instability has produced numerous faults  which cause approximately        earthquakes annually in Southern California  though most of them are too small to be felt      The strike slip San Andreas Fault system  which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate  passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area  The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every     to     years  and seismologists have warned about the next  big one   as the last major earthquake was the      Fort Tejon earthquake      The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes      Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the      Long Beach       San Fernando       Whittier Narrows  and the      Northridge events  All but a few are of low intensity and are not felt  The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast  which models earthquake occurrence in California  Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis  harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in       Valdivia earthquake in       Alaska earthquake

viewed from Griffith Observatory Left to right  Los Feliz  Echo Park  Downtown  and Hollywood  The city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods          some of which were incorporated cities that merged with Los Angeles      These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal  and are well defined enough that the city has signage marking nearly all of them       Overview The city s street patterns generally follow a grid plan  with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks  However  this is complicated by rugged terrain  which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers  Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city  many of which are extremely long  Sepulveda Boulevard is    miles     km  long  while Foothill Boulevard is over    miles     km  long  reaching as far east as San Bernardino  Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world  according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker  TomTom  LA drivers spend an additional    hours in traffic each year  During the peak rush hour there is     congestion  according to the index      Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low rise buildings  Outside of a few centers such as Downtown  Warner Center  Century City  Koreatown  Miracle Mile  Hollywood  and Westwood  skyscrapers and high rise buildings are not common  The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape  Most construction is done in separate units  rather than wall to wall  That being said  Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over    stories  with fourteen over    stories  and two over    stories  the tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center  Also  Los Angeles is increasingly becoming a city of apartments rather than single family dwellings  especially in the dense inner city and

enough annual precipitation to avoid semi arid climate  BSh        Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round  In winter  they average around     F      C  giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures          Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year  with an average of only    days with measurable precipitation annually      Temperatures in the coastal basin exceed     F      C  on a dozen or so days in the year  from one day a month in April  May  June and November to three days a month in July  August  October and to five days in September      Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer  Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings  in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over     F      C       The average annual temperature of the sea is     F      C   from     F      C  in January to     F      C  in August      Hours of sunshine total more than       per year  from an average of   hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of    in July        A very clear evening view of Mount Lee and the Hollywood Sign from the Griffith Observatory lawn  one day after a rain The Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate  causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other  For example  the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is     F      C  whereas it is     F      C  in Canoga Park     miles     km  away      The city  like much of the southern California coast  is subject to a late spring early summer weather phenomenon called  June Gloom   This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon      Downtown Los Angeles averages       in      mm  of precipitation annually  mainly occurring between November and March      generally in the form of moderate rain showers  but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms  Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift  Summer days are usually rainless  Rarely  an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer  especially to the mountains  The coast gets slightly less rainfall  while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more  Years of average rainfall are rare  The usual pattern is year to year variability  with a short string of dry years of      in          mm  rainfall  followed by one or two wet years with more than    in      mm       Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni o conditions in the Pacific  dry years with cooler water La Ni a episodes  A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills  especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes  Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast  with the last occurrence of a     F     C  reading at the downtown station being January               freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter  The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was     inches    cm  on January                   While the most recent snowfall occurred in February       the first snowfall since               At the official downtown station  the highest recorded temperature is      F      C  on

September          at the weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Woodland Hills      During autumn and winter  Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and

heavy reliance on automobiles  and the Los Angeles Long Beach port complex  Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog  The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion  which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles  airplanes  locomotives  shipping  manufacturing  and other sources       The percentage of small particle pollution  the kind that penetrates into the lungs  coming from vehicles in the city can get as high as    percent       The smog season lasts from approximately May to October       While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog  Los Angeles gets only    inches      mm  of rain each year  pollution accumulates over many consecutive days  Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation  including the Clean Air Act  When the act was passed  California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards  largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles       More recently  the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emission vehicles  Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it  which include electric and hybrid cars  improvements in mass transit  and other measures  The number of Stage   smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over     per year in the     s to almost zero in the new millennium       Despite

     In       the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year round particulate pollution       The city met its goal of providing    percent of the city s power from renewable sources in            The American Lung Association s      survey ranks the metro area as having the nation s worst smog  and fourth in both short term and year round pollution amounts
