 is a German upper bourgeois family that was historically a prominent group of European bankers  members of the fifteenth  and sixteenth century mercantile patriciate of Augsburg  international mercantile bankers  and venture capitalists  Alongside the Welser family  the Fugger family controlled much of the European economy in the sixteenth century and accumulated enormous wealth  The Fuggers held a near monopoly on the European copper market  This banking family replaced the de  Medici family  who influenced all of Europe during the Renaissance  The Fuggers took over many of the Medicis  assets and their political power and influence  They were closely affiliated with the House of Habsburg whose rise to world power they financed  Unlike the citizenry of their hometown and most other trading patricians of German free imperial cities  such as the Tuchers  they never converted to Lutheranism  as presented in the Augsburg Confession  but rather remained with the Roman Catholic Church and thus close to the Habsburg emperors  Jakob Fugger  the Rich  was elevated to the nobility of the Holy Roman Empire in May      and assumed the title Imperial Count of Kirchberg and Weissenhorn in       Today  he is considered to be one of the wealthiest people ever to have lived  The company was dissolved in       however the Fuggers remained wealthy landowners and ruled the County of Kirchberg and Weissenhorn  The Babenhausen branch became Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in       the Gl tt branch princes in the Kingdom of Bavaria in        Contents    History

  References   External links   History edit  Founding edit  The founder of the family was Johann Fugger  a weaver at Graben  near the Swabian Free City of Augsburg     The last name was originally spelled  Fucker    the first recorded reference to the family comes when Johann s son  also named Johann  or Hans   moves to Augsburg in       with the local tax register laconically noting Fucker advenit   Fugger has arrived         He married Klara Widolf and became an Augsburg citizen  After Klara s death  he married Elizabeth Gattermann  He joined the weaver s guild  and by      he was ranked high in the list of taxpayers  He added the business of a merchant to that of a weaver     His eldest son  Andreas Fugger  was a merchant in the weaving trade  and was nicknamed  Fugger the Rich     after buying land and other properties  The Fugger family itemized and inventoried a large number of Asian rugs  an unusual undertaking at the time     Andreas s son  Lukas Fugger  was granted arms by the Emperor Frederick III  a golden deer on a blue background  and he was soon nicknamed  the Fugger of the Deer      He was too ambitious  however  and went bankrupt  His descendants served their cousins of the famous younger branch and later went to Silesia  Contemporary members of the Fugger of the Deer  German  Fugger vom Reh  are descendants of Matth us Fugger                 The current patriarch is Markus Fugger von dem Rech  born          Portrait of Georg Fugger by Giovanni Bellini       Hans Fugger s younger son  Jakob the Elder  founded another branch of the family  This branch progressed more steadily and they became known as the  Fuggers of the Lily  after their chosen arms of a flowering lily on a gold and blue background  Jakob was a master weaver  a merchant  and an alderman  He married Barbara Basinger  the daughter of a goldsmith  His fortune progressed  and by       he was the twelfth richest man in Augsburg  He died in       Jakob s eldest son  Ulrich  took over the business on his father s death  and in      he provided new suits of clothes to Frederick  his son Maximilian I  and his suite on their journey to Trier to meet Charles the Bold of Burgundy and the betrothal of the young prince to Charles s daughter Maria  Thus began a very profitable relationship between the Fugger family and the Habsburgs  With the help of their brother in Rome  Markus  Ulrich and his brother George handled remittances to the papal court of monies for the sale of indulgences and the procuring of church benefices  From      to      they leased the Roman mint  Ulrich died in       When the Fuggers made their first loan to the Archduke Sigismund in       they took as security an interest in silver and copper mines in the Tirol  This was the beginning of an extensive family involvement in mining and precious metals     The Fuggers also participated in mining operations in Silesia  and owned copper mines in Hungary  Their trade in spices  wool  and silk extended to almost all parts of Europe      Jakob Fugger  the Rich  edit   Jakob Fugger   the Rich               by Albrecht D rer Ulrich s youngest brother Jakob Fugger  born in       was to become the most famous member of the dynasty  In      he married Sibylla Artzt  Grand Burgheress to Augsburg  the daughter of an eminent Grand Burgher of Augsburg  German Gro b rger zu Augsburg   They had no children  but this marriage gave Jakob the opportunity to elevate to Grand Burgher of Augsburg and later allowed him to pursue a seat on the city council  Stadtrat  of Augsburg  He was elevated to the nobility of the Holy Roman Empire in May       made Imperial Count in       and in      led a consortium of German and Italian businessmen that loaned Charles V         florins  about        oz t  or      kg of gold  to procure his election as Holy Roman Emperor over Francis I of France     The Fuggers  contribution was         florins  In       the Fuggers established their first public company  Jakob s aim was to establish a copper monopoly by opening foundries in Hohenkirchen and Fuggerau  named for the family  in Carinthia  and by expanding the sales organization in Europe  especially the Antwerp agency  Jakob leased the copper mines in Beszterceb nya in the Kingdom of Hungary  today Bansk  Bystrica  Slovakia  in       eventually making them the greatest mining centre of the time  At the height of his power Jakob Fugger was sharply criticized by his contemporaries  especially by Ulrich von Hutten and Martin Luther  for selling indulgences and benefices and urging the Pope to rescind or amend the prohibition on the levying of interest  The imperial fiscal and governmental authorities in Nuremberg brought action against him and other merchants in an attempt to halt their monopolistic practices  In       Jakob deposited        florins as an endowment for some almshouses  In       he bought up part of Augsburg and in      came to an agreement with the city that he would build and provide a number of almshouses for needy citizens  By          houses had been built  and the Fuggerei had come into existence  It is still used today     Jakob died in       He is considered to be one of the richest persons of all time     and today he is well known as Jakob Fugger  the rich    Later years edit      Ducats        minted as circulating currency by the Fugger Family     Jakob s successor was his nephew Anton Fugger  son of his elder brother Georg  Anton was born in       married Anna Rehlinger  and died in       In       the Fuggers were granted the revenues from the Spanish orders of knighthood together with the profits from mercury and silver mines      The formerly rich yield of the Tirolean and Hungarian mines decreased  but Anton established new trade ties with Peru and Chile and started mining ventures in Sweden and Norway  He was involved in the slave trade from Africa to America  but was more successful in the spice trade and the importation of Hungarian cattle  Eventually  he was forced to renounce the Maestrazgo lease after      and to give up the silver mines of Guadalcanal  After hard times under Anton s nephew and successor Johann Jakob  Anton s oldest son  Markus  carried on the business successfully  earning some            ducats between      and      from the production of mercury at Almad n alone  but the Fugger company was completely dissolved after the Thirty Years  War when Leopold Fugger returned the mines in Tyrol to the Habsburgs in         Fugger chapel of      at St  Anne s Church  Augsburg The
