          i  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Standard definition video mode  SDTV resolution by nation  countries using    i are in blue     i is a standard definition video mode originally used for terrestrial television in most countries of the world where the utility frequency for electric power distribution is    Hz  Because of its close association with the colour encoding system  it is often referred to as simply PAL  PAL SECAM or SECAM when compared to its    Hz  typically  see PAL M  NTSC colour encoded counterpart     i  In digital applications it is usually referred to as     i   in analogue contexts it is often called      lines      and the aspect ratio is usually     in analogue transmission and      in digital transmission  The     identifies a vertical resolution of     lines  and the i identifies it as an interlaced resolution  The field rate  which is    Hz  is sometimes included when identifying the video mode  i e     i    another notation  endorsed by both the International Telecommunication Union in BT     and SMPTE in SMPTE    M  includes the frame rate  as in    i     Its basic parameters common to both analogue and digital implementations are      scan lines or vertical pixels of picture content     frames  giving    fields  per second  In analogue    additional lines without image content are added to the displayed frame of     lines to allow time for older cathode ray tube circuits to retrace for the next frame     giving     lines per frame  Digital information not to be displayed as part of the image can be transmitted in the non displayed lines  teletext and other services and test signals are often implemented  Analogue television signals have no pixels  they are rastered in scan lines  but along each line the signal is continuous  In digital applications  the number of pixels per line is an arbitrary choice as long as it fulfils the sampling theorem  Values above about     pixels per line are enough for conventional free to air television  DVB T  DVD and DV allow better values such as     or      The video format can be transported by major digital television formats  ATSC  DVB and ISDB  and on DVD  and it supports aspect ratios of standard     and anamorphic        Contents    Baseband interoperability  analogue    Modulation for TVRO transmission   Baseband

true stereo service and can also carry multi lingual sound and radio services  These additional subcarriers are normally narrower bandwidth than the main mono subcarrier and are companded using Panda   or similar to preserve the signal to noise ratio  Data subcarriers may also be added Half transponder mode  e g      MHz   All of the above is done  but signal is bandwidth limited to    MHz The bandwidth limiting does not affect audio subcarriers Baseband interoperability  digital  edit  In digital video applications  such as DVDs and digital broadcasting  color encoding is no longer

PAL and SECAM  Digital video uses its own separate color space  so even the minor color space differences between PAL and SECAM become moot in the digital domain   Use with progressive sources edit  When    i is used to transmit content that was originally composed of    full progressive frames per second  the odd field of the frame is transmitted first  This is the opposite of NTSC  Systems which recover progressive frames  or transcode video should ensure that this field order is obeyed  otherwise the recovered frame will consist of a field from one frame and a field from an adjacent frame  resulting in  comb  interlacing artifacts   PAL speed up edit   Motion pictures are typically shot on film at    frames per second  When telecined and played back at PAL s standard of    frames per second  films run about    faster  This also applies to most TV series that are shot on film or digital   p     Unlike NTSC s telecine system  which uses     pulldown to convert the    frames per second to the    fps frame rate  PAL speed up results in the telecined video running    shorter than the original film as well as the equivalent NTSC telecined video  Depending on the sound system in use  it also slightly increases the pitch of the soundtrack by       cents         of a semitone   More recently  digital conversion methods have used algorithms which preserve the original pitch of the soundtrack  although the frame rate conversion still results in faster playback  Conversion methods exist that can convert    frames per second video to    frames per second with no speed increase  however image quality suffers when conversions of this type are used  This method is most commonly employed through conversions done digitally  i e  using a computer and software like VirtualDub   and is employed in situations where the importance of preserving the speed of the video outweighs the need for image quality  Many movie enthusiasts prefer PAL over NTSC despite the former s speed up  because the latter results in telecine judder  a visual distortion not present in PAL sped up video     states  the majority of authorities on the subject favour PAL over NTSC for DVD playback quality   Also DVD reviewers often make mention of this cause  For example  in his PAL vs  NTSC article     the founder of  MichaelDVD says   Personally  I find      pulldown  all but intolerable and find it very hard to watch a movie on an NTSC DVD because of it   In the DVD review of Frequency     one of his reviewers mentions   because of the     pull down artefacts that are associated with the NTSC format     I prefer PAL pretty much any day of the week   This is not an issue on modern upconverting DVD players and personal computers  as they play back       frame s encoded video at its true frame rate  without     pulldown  PAL speed up does not occur on native    fps video  such as British or European TV series or movies that are shot on video instead of film  Software which corrects the speed up is available for those viewing    i DVD films on their computers  WinDVD s  PAL TruSpeed  being the most ubiquitous citation needed   However  this method involves resampling the soundtrack s   which results in a slight decrease in audio quality  There is also a DirectShow Filter for Windows called ReClock developed by RedFox  formerly SlySoft  which can be used in a custom DirectShow Graph to remap the reference audio timing clock to correct the clock timing skew using an accurate self adaptive algorithm resulting in effective removal of judder during panning caused by Euro pulldown including audio pitch correction via time stretching with WASAPI Exclusive Mode and SPDIF AC   Encoding output modes   See also edit    Television portal List of common resolutions     p
