speech to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts  Sky News started broadcasting at   pm on   February           Visually Sky News looked very neat  with slick and classy presentation and John O Loan s original vocation as an architect showing in the studio set  Sky had gone for the same format as the Nine O Clock News on the BBC  which had recently been redesigned to give the impression of activity and immediacy by placing the newsreader against a backdrop of the working newsroom  Sky News  it was universally agreed as staff nodded in vigorous approval  had succeeded rather better at the same thing  The critics were mildly taken aback  Contrary to some of the horror scenarios bandied about by the chattering classes there seemed to be little to grumble about  And as its slogan of  We re there when you need us   emphasised  it was always on  In the early days  the channel operated on a     million budget  plus     million share of overheads   which led Sam Chisholm  chief executive of the newly merged BSkyB to suggest to Murdoch that the station be closed  but Murdoch was  pleased with its achievements     there were overriding reasons of prestige and politics for keeping it     the final hurdle of the Broadcasting Bill had still to be overcome and the case for the acceptability of Sky would collapse if suddenly there was no news channel        Former Home Secretary William Whitelaw said in the House of Lords in      that Sky News had  a very high reputation     I admire it  as do many other people  it will certainly waken up both the BBC and ITN and ensure that they compete with what is a very important news service   The channel has never been run for a profit     and has considered using ITN to supplement the service  citation needed  By March       Sky News  parent company turned from loss to profit     On the channel s growth  Murdoch said at that time   Sky News  has quietly  if expensively  become the first building block of what we envision will become the premier worldwide electronic news gathering network anywhere  Ask anyone in Europe  and particularly the BBC and you will be told that Sky News has added a new and better dimension to television journalism   Sky News was the UK s first    hour news channel  broadcast on Astra  A  It had no local competition until November       when BBC News launched a new    hour channel  BBC News     now known simply as BBC News  In September       the European Commission ruled against a Sky News complaint  which argued that the publicly funded BBC News    was unfair and illegal under EU law  The EC ruled that the television licence fee should be considered state aid  within the meaning of Article      but that the BBC s public service remit justified the channel

news bulletins to Channel    taking over from ITN in January          On    October       Sky News moved to new studios in Isleworth  Greater London  and underwent a major on screen revamp  The new studio was integrated with the newsroom and boasted the biggest video wall in Britain  it was designed by New York architects Janson Design Group     New music was scored by Adelphoi Music and recorded with a full orchestra at Air Studios  Hampstead  and mastered at Metropolis Studios      New on screen graphics were launched and the channel began broadcasting in widescreen        format  The      relaunch also had the introduction of a new schedule designed around  appointment to view  programmes rather than continuous rolling news     James Rubin joined to present a new evening programme called World News Tonight  Julie Etchingham presented another new  hard hitting  evening show called The Sky Report  Eamonn Holmes joined to present Sunrise  Kay Burley presented a new programme called Lunchtime Live from    to   pm  and the daytime show Sky News Today had the introduction of a three presenter format  However  the relaunched schedule was unsuccessful  and from October       the BBC News channel overtook Sky News in the ratings  In response to the schedule s unpopularity with viewers      July      saw the removal of the evening programmes  which were replaced by rolling news and an interactive programme  Sky News with Martin Stanford  and the return to a two presenter format on Sky News Today  These changes came with the arrival of John Ryley  who is still the head of Sky News  On   October       Sky introduced another new schedule  extending Kay Burley s Lunchtime Live programme and renaming it Afternoon Live  It also switched to a new format for much of the day  with a solo lead presenter and a summary newsreader  Sky News put more emphasis on interactive news with Martin Stanford s new SkyNews com programme  an early evening financial news programme presented by Jeff Randall  was also introduced  initially on Mondays only  Further changes were made to the Sky News schedule on   September       with Colin Brazier presenting a new show from       pm  The Live Desk  and Martin Stanford s Sky com News became SkyNews com  moving to   pm every weeknight   More changes took place during the early part of       These changes involved major changes to the layout of the newsroom studio  the introduction of a morning edition of The Live Desk and the extension of the financial news programme Jeff Randall Live to run for four nights each week  Monday to Thursday  From   am to midnight on   March       Sky News was presented and produced exclusively by women to mark International Women s Day      This exercise was repeated in      and       In preparation for the start of high definition broadcasting  Sky News moved to its second studio  Studio B  on the morning of    March       Broadcasting from Studio B continued until   pm on   May  when it moved back to the main newsroom and launched Sky News HD in time for the      general election results  Sky News received a graphics refresh and a new logo to coincide with the launch of the new HD channel   this was tried out during the soft launch for Sky News HD on    April  Sky News  distinctive orchestral theme music  in use since       was also updated on   May        The new title music  orchestrated by David Arnold  was recorded with a    piece Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Angel Recording Studios  London  and uses more than     audio channels for    seconds of sound      Following the      general election  Sky News was rebranded  with a new top of the hour sequence and on screen graphics  The traditional opening voiceover  read by Bruce Hammal  was dropped after two decades in use  On    October       Sky News began broadcasting from a new studio  Studio     at Sky Central  Sky s new headquarters in West London      The  glass box  studio was initially used for broadcasts from   am to      pm each weekday  with the exception of All Out Politics  which comes from Sky s Westminster studio    as of April      it is now only used from    am to   pm  and

over to Studio      the glass box   and a new studio in Sky Studios   Acquisition by Comcast edit  On   December       Sky shareholder   st Century Fox announced that it had made an offer to acquire the remainder of the company for       billion          The combination of Sky with Fox s other assets led to concerns that the Murdoch family would attain  material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms  and  increased influence over the UK news agenda and the political process   Concerns were also raised about recent sexual harassment allegations centered upon Fox s U S  network Fox News Channel  although Ofcom did deem   st Century Fox to be  fit and proper  to hold broadcast licences              On    December       The Walt Disney Company in turn announced its intent to acquire   st Century Fox  following the divestiture of certain assets  particularly the U S  Fox network proper   Analysts felt that would ease regulatory tensions surrounding the Fox purchase of Sky  as Sky was to be included in the purchase  and Disney s scope of media ownership in the UK was not as wide      In January       the Competition and Markets Authority issued a preliminary report recommending that Sky News be insulated from the remainder of Murdoch s assets  or divested  in order to preserve its editorial independence      The following month  Fox proposed a commitment to funding Sky News for    years  and the establishment of an independent editorial board  The commitments would have been inherited by Disney if it completed its purchase          On   April       Fox stated that Disney had expressed interest in acquiring Sky News in a separate transaction  not dependent on the outcome of the Disney Fox purchase      On   June       Culture Secretary Matt Hancock cleared Fox s proposed deal  contingent on the divestiture of Sky News  It also cleared counteroffers for Sky that were being made in a bidding war by U S  telecoms and media conglomerate Comcast          Comcast made a US    billion counter offer to acquire the   st Century Fox assets being sold to Disney      Fox rejected the offer  in favour of a higher valued offer from Disney      Comcast subsequently pursued a counter offer for Sky only  resulting in the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordering that a blind auction be held between Comcast and Fox  On    September  Comcast was declared the winner of the auction          resulting in Fox agreeing to sell its controlling stake in Sky to the company          The sale made Sky News a sister division to NBC News a U S  based news operation owned by Comcast s U S  media division NBCUniversal  its U S  pay television news channel MSNBC  as well as Euronews a pan European news channel which NBCUniversal owned a stake in at the time of purchase  In April       Comcast CEO Brian Roberts stated that the company was exploring the establishment of a  global  news channel as a joint venture between Sky News and NBC News      In January       it was stated that this new channel would also be carried on NBCUniversal s new U S  streaming video platform Peacock      In April       it was stated that the launch of the service  now known as NBC Sky World News  would be delayed due to the COVID    pandemic      On    April       NBCUniversal sold its stake in Euronews to one of its

Criticism and perception edit  Main article  Criticisms of Sky UK  Sky News viewing peaked during    September attacks  Iraq War  Asian tsunami    July      London bombings and the death of Diana  Princess of Wales but has generally declined to a quarter achieved in         Sky News operates under United Kingdom broadcasting regulations which require impartial  unbiased coverage and prevent the channel from being encrypted in the UK  The channel is viewed by some in the media establishment as an impartial and unbiased provider of news      There are occasional claims                     that Sky News may be inherently biased due to the fact that throughout the     s and     s it was minority owned and dominated by Rupert Murdoch s right leaning News Corporation  and thereafter the Murdoch family s   st Century Fox  Many News Corp subsidiaries  including News Corp UK   Ireland Ltd  the owner of the Sun  Times and Sunday Times newspapers  have an openly conservative or right wing outlook  In a      article in the New Statesman  prominent journalist and broadcaster Mehdi Hasan argued that  in style and in substance  of course  it is nothing like the pro war  pro Republican  pro Palin Fox News Channel    Sky News remains  as far as I can see  free of party political bias       As of October       Fox no longer has any stake in the broadcaster      Ofcom received complaints regarding the network s lack of neutrality ahead of the      General Election  but these were not upheld          In early      Kelvin MacKenzie  former editor of The Sun newspaper  was appointed managing director of BSkyB  Sky News s parent company at the time  MacKenzie s proposed changes to Sky News led to clashes with CEO Sam Chisholm and the head of Sky News  Ian Frykberg  who protested at what they saw as an attempt to take the channel s news values downmarket  The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with Lady Bienvenida Buck  Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards  The interview was broadcast on Sky One      MacKenzie announced his resignation in August           but not before Sky News had transmitted live pictures of the freeway chase of OJ Simpson white Bronco on    June      bringing US helicopter journalism to the UK      In      Sky News broadcast live coverage of Louise Woodward s trial  held in Boston  Massachusetts      When Sky returned to a regular schedule  viewers demanded the trial coverage be continued      Sky News broadcast reaction from Woodward s home town of Elton  Cheshire  leading to criticism that the station had a pro Louise Woodward stance      In November      the then head of BBC News  Peter Horrocks  acknowledged that Sky News remained the first choice for  key opinion formers       Ofcom received     complaints regarding the network s neutrality after it hosted the second leaders  debate ahead of the      General Election      Ofcom received     complaints about a May      interview with electoral reformist David Babbs conducted by Sky News presenter Kay Burley  The interview led to Burley being heckled by protesters while reporting from Westminster  and further protest via a Twitter campaign      Ofcom received     complaints relating to Sky News s then political editor Adam Boulton s conduct during a May      interview with Alastair Campbell      In       Sky News journalist Colin Brazier rifled through an Malaysia Airlines Flight    victim s possessions on live TV  He picked up objects and briefly described what he had before putting them down and saying  we shouldn t really be doing this I suppose  really       complaints were submitted to Ofcom  Sky News stated both Brazier  and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused       Sky News was again embroiled in controversy in October       when crime correspondent Martin Brunt and his camera crew doorstepped Brenda Leyland  who had posted controversial comments concerning the McCann investigation on social media          Following the confrontation Leyland was found dead in a hotel  leading to calls on social media for Brunt to be sacked      During the inquest into Leyland s death  Brunt expressed to the coroner that he was devastated at hearing the news of Leyland s suicide  Following the inquest  Ofcom reported it had received     complaints in relation to the case and that it would consider these complaints in light of the coroner s verdict      In       Kay Burley caused further controversy when  in response to the November      Paris attacks  she tweeted a photograph of a Golden Retriever dog  to which she had added   Sadness in his eyes  parisattacks            Fabrication edit  In April       Sky News carried a report from James Forlong aboard the British nuclear submarine HMS Splendid purportedly showing a live firing of a cruise missile during the Iraq war  The report was a fabrication  with the crew acting along for the benefit of the cameras  The Sky News team did not accompany the submarine when it left port and the scenes were actually recorded whilst the vessel was docked  The shot of the missile launch had been obtained from stock footage  The faked report was revealed because another film crew did accompany the vessel to sea  and its footage showed that a modern missile is not launched by a crew member pressing a red button marked with the word  FIRE   as had been portrayed in the Sky News report  but is actually launched with a left mouse click  When the fabrication was exposed  Forlong and his producer were suspended  The next day  The Guardian reported that Forlong had resigned following an internal investigation      In a follow up article  The Guardian speculated on the long term effects on Sky News credibility      In October       Forlong was found dead by his wife after committing suicide      In December  Sky News was fined         by the Independent Television Commission for breaching accuracy regulations          In August      Sky News was criticised after allegedly paying        to a group of Romanians to pretend they were part of an eastern European gang selling guns to terrorists in Syria  The Romanians were arrested by Romanian DIICOT and confessed that they were paid by Sky News journalist Stuart Ramsay to pretend they were gun traffickers  The guns featured in the report were legally owned and were hunting weapons          Sky News has said it stands by the story       Legal cases edit  November        BSkyB paid substantial undisclosed libel damages to Robert Murat in relation to their reporting of the abduction of Madeleine McCann  Sky News had falsely suggested that Murat  who was assisting in the search of McCann  had acted like child murderer Ian Huntley following McCann s disappearance  Sky News also falsely accused Murat of misleading journalists into thinking he was working for the police  An apology was also placed on the Sky News website  the libellous material removed and Murat s costs were paid      November        the Attorney General for England and Wales  Dominic Grieve QC  was given the right to launch contempt of court proceedings against Sky News over the broadcaster s alleged breach of a media injunction  It was in relation to the reporting of the story of Paul and Rachel Chandler  a Kent couple who were held captive by Somali pirates for    months  The media was blocked from publishing details of the couple s  health and welfare  prior to their being freed on    November       Sky claims that it  scrupulously observed the terms of the injunction   but also admitted that it  followed the spirit  if not the letter  of the order  At the time  lawyers representing the Chandlers obtained the court order over fears that their lives could be put in danger by the media reporting their capture  Sky News was alleged to have breached the injunction on the day of their release around from Somalia  leading the Attorney General to seek permission at the High Court to bring contempt proceedings      The Attorney General dropped the case in January       a spokesperson for his office said that continuing with proceedings would no longer be in the public interest      March        Sky News journalist Mark Stone and his camera operator were detained in Tiananmen Square live on British television  in what he described as a surreal but telling episode about reporting in China  Viewers saw Stone being directed into a police van live from Beijing  The square is a popular tourist site near the regime s nerve centre and the scene of      democracy protests that were crushed by the Chinese authorities  A police officer was filmed asking the Sky team to switch off their camera  saying they were now inside the Forbidden City and did not have permission to film there  While they had permission to film in the square  Stone said police told him the team were not displaying their passes correctly  and noted he was not carrying his passport as required  China s foreign ministry insists that press censorship does not exist in the country  but journalists report the constant threat of interference from government officials  Awards edit  Sky News won BAFTA awards for coverage of the    September      attacks     and the      Soham murders      Sky News s coverage of the   July
