First series  The Lobby  edit  In the UK  the National Union of Students  Jewish Labour Movement  Union of Jewish Students  Conservative Friends of Israel  Labour Friends of Israel and other UK based pro Israel groups    were profiled  Additionally  the series explores claims of antisemitism in the Labour Party and also the role of Joan Ryan   Production edit  Using undercover techniques  the film relied primarily on fly on the wall footage using a surreptitious bodycam and other cameras whose presence were not known to those being filmed  The film took six months to make and was broadcast on al Jazeera in January           Themes edit  Targeting pro Palestinian politicians  Shai Masot  an official at the embassy  was recorded as seeking in a conversation with a British civil servant to  take down  British politicians  including Alan Duncan  then Minister of State for Europe and the Americas  Crispin Blunt  chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee  was said by a British civil servant who was formerly an aide to another Conservative minister  to be on a  hitlist               Supporting lobbying groups  Masot was also recorded as seeking to promote the establishment of a pro Israel youth organisation  intended to be linked to the existing Labour Friends of Israel      He was also recorded as telling Joan Ryan  Chair of Labour Friends of Israel  that he had    million to fund trips to Israel      Allegations of antisemitism  Joan Ryan was shown arguing with Labour Party member and pro Palestine activist Jean Fitzpatrick about a two state solution between Israel and the Palestine at the      Labour Party Conference  Ryan lodged a formal complaint of antisemitic behaviour as a result of this conversation  Her account of the incident was disputed and her complaint was later dismissed  Fitzpatrick told al Jazeera that  If you do talk about Palestine  it would appear you re kind of sucked into having an accusation of anti Semitism brought against you   The film also included an interview with Jackie Walker  who was accused of antisemitism in relation to remarks she made at the conference  Walker told al Jazeera that  I would say there is a crisis in the way the anti Semitism is being manipulated and being used by certain parts   not just in the Labour Party but other parties and the media to discredit Jeremy Corbyn and a number of his supporters       Consequences and responses edit  The Israeli ambassador  Mark Regev apologized to Alan Duncan for the comments made by Masot     Masot was sent back to Israel and resigned  as did the civil servant involved      The Shadow Foreign Secretary  Emily Thornberry  called on the Commons foreign affairs committee to conduct an inquiry into what appeared to be improper interference in British politics by a foreign power      The Leader of the Opposition  Jeremy Corbyn  wrote to the Prime Minister along the same lines      Alex Salmond  the Scottish National Party s foreign affairs spokesman  asked for a full investigation      while Crispin Blunt questioned whether Israel s interests were best served by such methods     However  Boris Johnson  then Foreign Secretary  rejected calls to take action against the Israeli embassy and said that he regarded the matter as closed      The National Union of Students said it was investigating alleged attempts to influence last year s leadership election  which saw its first black  Muslim  female president Malia Bouattia voted in  Following claims that opposing NUS members held  secret meetings  with activists supported by the Israeli embassy  a spokesperson for the union said the organisation was looking into the allegations  particularly regarding NUS officers  citation needed  The Labour Party declined to investigate complaints arising from the programme against Joan Ryan and the Jewish Labour Movement director      In October       Ofcom rejected complaints that the series was antisemitic or had breached impartiality rules      Second series  The Lobby   USA  edit  A US version of the film  on the Israel lobby in the United States  was made  in which an Al Jazeera reporter named James Anthony Kleinfeld had infiltrated several pro Israel advocacy organizations in Washington  D C  including Stand With Us  Brandeis Center  The Israel Project  the Foundation for Defense of Democracies  the Israel on Campus Coalition  the Zionist Organization of America s  ZOA  Fuel For Truth  and the Canary Mission   One of the major claims in the film is that Israeli American real estate investor Adam Milstein  a  major donor to pro Israel campus groups  funds Canary Mission  an anonymous website that names and shames pro Palestinian activists at North American universities      The evidence for the claim is an exchange between Al Jazeera s undercover reporter  Toby  who is posing as an intern and Eric Gallagher  an employee at The Israel Project       Gallagher tells  Tony  that Milstein spoke with him on the phone about starting a  name and shame  effort  and solicited his feedback   So  Adam Milstein funds The Israel Project and he s funding the Canary Mission website   Tony asks    Yeah  which is interesting because it makes us seem as though we re a part of it  but we re not   Gallagher responds  referring to The Israel Project  In a statement to JTA  a spokesperson for Milstein denied that he funded Canary Mission  The spokesperson also provided an email from Gallagher where he denied having referred to Milstein       Blocked screening and subsequent leak edit  On October           Al Jazeera announced that it had installed an undercover journalist inside several Washington based pro Israel organisations in      and that it was planning to air a documentary film based on the reporter s work  Clayton Swisher  Al Jazeera s director of investigative reporting  also acknowledged that the network had stationed an undercover journalist in both the UK and US at the same time              On February          it was reported that Qatari leaders had reassured the leaders of Jewish American organisations that Al Jazeera would not be airing the US companion series  According to Haaretz  the Qatari government had reportedly hired Republican Senator Ted Cruz s former aide Nicolas Muzin to open communications channels with Jewish American organisations  Earlier  the network had sent letters to several American pro Israel organisations informing them that their employees would appear in the documentary  These letters generated speculation that the Qatari government had reneged on its earlier promise to block Al Jazeera from screening the controversial documentary which  like the earlier British series  had utilized clandestine footage and recordings of pro Israel activists          Al Jazeera s decision not to screen the documentary drew criticism from Clayton Swisher  who defended the network s investigation unit s use of undercover journalism and accused the network of capitulation to outside pressure  Swisher also took a sabbatical from Al Jazeera to express his disagreement with the network s handling of the situation      In March       a bipartisan group of US lawmakers including Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer  Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin  and Ted Cruz penned a letter urging United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate whether Al Jazeera should register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act  They also urged the Justice Department to investigate reports that the network had infiltrated non profit organisations and accused Al Jazeera of broadcasting antisemitic  anti Israel  and anti American content              On April           the Zionist Organization of America s president Morton Klein claimed credit for lobbying the Qatari government not to screen Al Jazeera s companion documentary series focusing on American pro Israel lobby  citation needed  In late August and early September       leaked portions of the documentary series were aired by several outlets including The Electronic Intifada          In early November  The Electronic Intifada released the four episodes of The Lobby USA simultaneously with the French media outlet Orient XXI and the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar              Al Jazeera issued a statement condemning its release       Reception edit  Asa Winstanley called The Lobby a  superb undercover investigation       The Jewish Chronicle dismissed the film as  the stupid bragging of two junior aides with close to zero influence       Ali Abunimah called The Lobby   USA a really  important film       unreliable source    See also edit  The Israel Lobby and U S  Foreign Policy References edit      The Lobby
