 region  local community  or an individual are improved according to targeted goals and objectives  The term has been used frequently in the   th and   st centuries  but the concept has existed in the West for far longer   Modernization    Westernization   and especially  industrialization  are other terms often used while discussing economic development  Whereas economic development is a policy intervention aiming to improve the well being of people  economic growth is a phenomenon of market productivity and increases in GDP  economist Amartya Sen describes economic growth as but  one aspect of the process of economic development   Economists primarily focus on the growth aspect and the economy at large  whereas researchers of community economic development concern themselves with socioeconomic development as well  Many institutions of higher education offer economic development as an area of study and research such as McGill University  London School of Economics

been contested  while economists in the   th century viewed development primarily in terms of economic growth  sociologists instead emphasized broader processes of change and modernization     Development and urban studies scholar Karl Seidman summarizes economic development as  a process of creating and utilizing physical  human  financial  and social assets to generate improved and broadly shared economic well being and quality of life for a community or region      Daphne Greenwood and Richard Holt distinguish economic development from economic growth on the basis that economic development is a  broadly based and sustainable increase in the overall standard of living for individuals within a community   and measures of growth such as per capita income do not necessarily correlate with improvements in quality of life     Economic development is a wider concept and has qualitative dimensions  Economic development implies economic growth plus progressive changes in certain important variables which determine well being of the people e g  health  education  The University of Iowa s Center for International Finance and Development states that    Economic development  is a term that practitioners  economists  politicians  and others have used frequently in the   th century  The concept  however  has been in existence in the West for centuries  Modernization  Westernisation  and especially Industrialisation are other terms people have used while discussing economic development   Economic development has a direct relationship with the environment  Though the concept s origin is uncertain  some scholars argue that development is closely bound up with the evolution of capitalism and the demise of feudalism      Others link it to the postcolonial state     Mansell and Wehn also state that economic development has been understood by non practitioners since the World War II to involve economic growth  namely the increases in per capita income  and  if currently absent  the attainment of a standard of living equivalent to that of industrialized countries        Economic development can also be considered as a static theory that documents the state of an economy at a certain time  According to Schumpeter and Backhaus         the changes in this equilibrium state to document in economic theory can only be caused by intervening factors coming from the outside      History edit  Economic development originated in the post war period of reconstruction initiated by the United States  In       during his inaugural speech  President Harry Truman identified the development of undeveloped areas  as a priority for the west    More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery  Their food is inadequate  they are victims of disease  Their economic life is primitive and stagnant  Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas  For the first time in history humanity possesses the knowledge  and the skill to relieve the suffering   from these people     I believe that we should make available to peace loving peoples the benefits of our  store of technical knowledge in order to help them  the realize their aspirations for a better life  What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing     Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace  And the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modem scientific and technical knowledge   There have been several major phases of development theory since       Alexander Gerschenkron argued that the less developed the country is at the outset of economic development  relative to others   the more likely certain conditions are to occur  Hence  all countries do not progress similarly      From the     s to the     s the state played a large role in promoting industrialization in developing countries  following the idea of modernization theory  This period was followed by a brief period of basic needs development focusing on human capital development and redistribution in the     s  Neoliberalism emerged in the     s pushing an agenda of free trade and removal of import substitution industrialization policies  In economics  the study of economic development was borne out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on national product  or the aggregate output of goods and services  Economic development was concerned with the expansion of people s entitlements and their corresponding capabilities  morbidity  nourishment  literacy  education  and other socio economic indicators      Borne out of the backdrop of Keynesian economics  advocating government intervention   and neoclassical economics  stressing reduced intervention   with the rise of high growth countries  Singapore  South Korea  Hong Kong  and planned governments  Argentina  Chile  Sudan  Uganda   economic development and more generally development economics emerged amidst these mid   th century theoretical interpretations of how economies prosper      Also  economist Albert O  Hirschman  a major contributor to development economics  asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the poor regions of the world  primarily in Africa  Asia and Latin America yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models      It has also been argued  notably by Asian and European proponents of infrastructure based development  that systematic  long term government investments in transportation  housing  education  and healthcare are necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in emerging countries   Growth and development edit  This section does not cite any sources

growth deals with an increase in the level of output  but economic development is related to an increase in output coupled with improvement in the social and political welfare of people within a country   Dependency theorists argue that poor countries have sometimes experienced economic growth with little or no economic development initiatives  for instance  in cases where they have functioned mainly as resource providers to wealthy industrialized countries  There is an opposing argument  however  that growth causes development because some of the increase in income gets spent on human development factors such as education and health  According to Ranis et al   economic growth and development is a two way relationship  According to them  the first chain consists of economic growth benefiting human development  since economic growth is likely to lead families and individuals to use their heightened incomes to increase expenditures  which in turn furthers human development  At the same time  the increased consumption and spending  health  education  and infrastructure systems grow and contribute to economic growth  In addition to increasing private incomes  economic growth also generates additional resources that can be used to improve social services  such as healthcare  safe drinking water  etc    By generating additional resources for social services  unequal income distribution will be mitigated as such social services are distributed equally across each community  thereby benefiting each individual  Concisely  the relationship between human development and economic development can be explained in three ways  First  an increase in average income leads to improvement in health and nutrition  known as Capability Expansion through Economic Growth   Second  it is believed that social outcomes can only be improved by reducing income poverty  known as Capability Expansion through Poverty Reduction   Lastly  social outcomes can also be improved with essential services such as education  healthcare  and clean drinking water  known as Capability Expansion through Social Services   John Joseph Puthenkalam s research aims at the process of economic growth theories that lead to economic development  After analyzing the existing capitalistic growth development theoretical apparatus  he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom  democracy  and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future economic growth development of any nation depends on this emerging model as we witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the Middle East  He develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of  micro knowledge  and  macro knowledge   Micro knowledge is what an individual learns from school or various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently receive  How to combine both these pieces of knowledge would determine further growth that leads to the economic development of developing nations  Yet others believe that several basic building blocks need to be in place for growth and development to take place   For instance  some economists believe that a fundamental first step toward development and growth is to address property rights issues  otherwise  only a small part of the economic sector will be able to participate in growth   That is  without inclusive property rights in the equation  the informal sector will remain outside the mainstream economy  excluded and without the same opportunities for study   The economic development of countries can also be implicated or contributed by the multinational corporations  companies   Economic development goals edit  The development of a country has been associated with different concepts but generally encompasses economic growth through higher productivity      political systems that represent as accurately as possible the preferences of its citizens          the extension of rights to all social groups and the opportunities to get them     and the proper functionality of institutions and organizations that are able to attend more technically and logistically complex tasks  i e  raise taxes and deliver public services           These processes describe the State s capabilities to manage its economy  polity  society and public administration      Generally  economic development policies attempt to solve issues in these topics  With this in mind  economic development is typically associated with improvements in a variety of areas or indicators  such as literacy rates  life expectancy  and poverty rates   that may be causes of economic development rather than consequences of specific economic development programs  For example  health and education improvements have been closely related to economic growth  but the causality with economic development may not be obvious  In any case  it is important to not expect that particular economic development programs be able to fix many problems at once as that would be establishing unsurmountable goals for them that are highly unlikely they can achieve  Any development policy should set limited goals and a gradual approach to avoid falling victim to something Prittchet  Woolcock and Andrews call  premature load bearing       Many times the economic development goals of specific countries cannot be reached because they lack the State s capabilities to do so  For example  if a nation has little capacity to carry out basic functions like security and policing or core service delivery it is unlikely that a program that wants to foster a free trade zone  special economic zones  or distribute vaccinations to vulnerable populations can accomplish their goals  This has been something overlooked by multiple international organizations  aid programs and even participating governments who attempt to carry out  best practices  from other places in a carbon copy manner with little success  This isomorphic mimicry  adopting organizational forms that have been successful elsewhere but that only hide institutional dysfunction without solving it on the home country  can contribute to getting countries stuck in  capability traps  where the country does not advance in its development goals      An example of this can be seen through some of the criticisms of foreign aid and its success rate at helping countries develop  citation needed  Beyond the incentive compatibility problems that can happen to foreign aid donations  that foreign aid granting countries continue to give it to countries with little results of economic growth     but with corrupt leaders that are aligned with the granting countries  geopolitical interests and agenda      there are problems of fiscal fragility associated to receiving an important amount of government revenues through foreign aid  Governments that can raise a significant amount of revenue from this source are less accountable to their citizens  they are more autonomous  as they have less pressure to legitimately use those resources      Just as it has been documented for countries with an abundant supply of natural resources such as oil      countries whose government budget consists largely of foreign aid donations and not regular taxes are less likely to have incentives to develop effective public institutions      This in turn can undermine the country s efforts to develop   Economic development policies edit  In its broadest sense  policies of economic development encompass two major areas   Governments undertaking to meet broad economic objectives such as price stability  high employment  and sustainable growth  Such efforts include monetary and fiscal policies  regulation of financial institutions  trade  and tax policies  Programs that provide infrastructure and services such as highways  parks  affordable housing  crime prevention  and K    education  Job creation and retention through specific efforts in business finance  marketing  neighborhood development  workforce development  small business development  business retention and expansion      technology transfer  and real estate development  This third category is a primary focus of economic development professionals  Contractionary monetary policy is a tool used by central banks to slow down a country s economic growth  An example would be raising interest rates to decrease lending  In the United States  the use of contractionary monetary policy has increased women s unemployment      Seguino and Heintz uses a panel dataset for each    states with unemployment  labor force participation by race  and annual labor market statistics  In addition  for contractionary monetary policy they utilize the federal funds rate  the short term interest rates charged to banks  Seguino and Heintz Seguino concludes that the impact of a one percentage point increase in the federal funds rate relative to white and black women s unemployment is       and        respectively     One growing understanding in economic development is the promotion of regional clusters and a thriving metropolitan economy  In today s global landscape  location is vitally important and becomes a key in competitive advantage  citation needed  International trade and exchange rates are a key issue in economic development  Currencies are often either under valued or over valued  resulting in trade surpluses or deficits  Furthermore  the growth of globalization has linked economic development with trends on international trade and participation in global value chains  GVCs  and international financial markets  The last financial crisis had a huge effect on economies in developing countries  Economist Jayati Ghosh states that it is necessary to make financial markets in developing countries more resilient by providing a variety of financial institutions  This could also add to financial security for small scale producers       Organization edit  Main article  economic development organization This section does not cite any sources  Please help improve this

Learn how and when to remove this template message  Economic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners  The practitioners have two key roles  one is to provide leadership in policy making  and the other is to administer policy  programs  and projects  Economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state  regional  or municipal level  or in public private partnerships organizations that may be partially funded by local  regional  state  or federal tax money  These economic development organizations function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments  Their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth  There are numerous other organizations whose primary function is not economic development that work in partnership with economic developers  They include the news media  foundations  utilities  schools  health care providers  faith based organizations  and colleges  universities  and other education or research institutions   International Economic Development Council edit  With more than        professional economic developers employed worldwide in this highly specialized industry  the International Economic Development Council  IEDC  headquartered in Washington  D C  is a non profit organization dedicated to helping economic developers do their job more effectively and raising the profile of the profession  With over       members across the US and internationally  serving exclusively the economic development community  IEDC membership represents the entire range of the profession ranging from regional  state  local  rural  urban  and international economic development organizations  as well as chambers of commerce  technology development agencies  utility companies  educational institutions  consultants and redevelopment authorities  Many individual states also have associations comprising economic development professionals  who work closely with IEDC  citation needed   Development indicators and indices edit  There are various types of macroeconomic and sociocultural indicators or  metrics  used by economists and geographers to assess the relative economic advancement of a given region or nation  The World Bank s  World Development Indicators  are compiled annually from officially recognized international sources and include national  regional and global estimates       GDP per capita   growing development population edit  GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by mid year population  GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidizes not included in the value of the products  It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources   Modern transportation edit  European development economists have argued that the existence of modern transportation networks  such as high speed rail infrastructure constitutes a significant indicator of a country s economic advancement  this perspective is illustrated notably through the Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index  known as BRTI Index      and related models such as the  Modified  Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index  RTI        Introduction of The GDI and GEM edit  In an effort to create an indicator that would help measure gender equality  the UN has created two measures  the Gender related Development Index  GDI  and the Gender Empowerment Measure  GEM   These indicators were first introduced in the      UNDP Human Development Report       Gender Empowerment Measure edit  The Gender Empowerment Measure  GEM  focuses on aggregating various indicators that focus on capturing the economic  political  and professional gains made by women  The GEM is composed of just three variables  income earning power  share in professional and managerial jobs  and share of parliamentary seats       Gender Development Index edit  The Gender Development  GDI  measures the gender gap in human development achievements  It takes disparity between men and women into account in through three variables  health  knowledge  and living standards       Community competition edit  This section does not cite any sources  Please help

consequence of economic development is the intense competition between communities  states  and nations for new economic development projects in today s globalized world  For example  when Amazon was looking for the next location to place their second headquarters  Amazon HQ    cities and regions across the nation began submitting bids to Amazon  Other countries  such as Canada and Mexico  also submitted proposals in an attempt to win      With the struggle to attract and retain business  competition is further intensified by the use of many variations of economic incentives to the potential business such as  tax incentives  investment capital  donated land  utility rate discounts  and many others  IEDC places significant attention on the various activities undertaken by economic development organizations to help them compete and sustain vibrant communities  Additionally  the use of community profiling tools and database templates to measure community assets versus other communities is also an important aspect of economic development  Job creation  economic output  and increase in taxable basis are the most common measurement tools  When considering measurement  too much emphasis has been placed on economic developers for  not creating jobs   However  the reality is that economic developers do not typically create jobs  but facilitate the process for existing businesses and start ups to do so  Therefore  the economic developer must make sure that there are sufficient economic development programs in place to assist the businesses achieve their goals  Those types of programs are usually policy created and can be local  regional  statewide and national in nature   See also edit   Constitutional economics Development finance institution European Free Trade
