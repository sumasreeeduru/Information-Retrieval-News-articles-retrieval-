  t kv l   to k        was a French aristocrat  diplomat  political scientist  political philosopher and historian  He is best known for his works Democracy in America  appearing in two volumes       and       and The Old Regime and the Revolution         In both  he analysed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies  Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville s travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science  Tocqueville was active in French politics  first under the July Monarchy             and then during the Second Republic             which succeeded the February      Revolution  He retired from political life after Louis Napol on Bonaparte s   December      coup and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution     Tocqueville argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV  The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals  Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government and was skeptical of the extremes of democracy     During his time in parliament  he sat on the centre left     but the complex and restless nature of his liberalism has led to contrasting interpretations and admirers across the political spectrum               Regarding his political position

Herv  Louis Fran ois Jean Bonaventure Cl rel  Count of Tocqueville  an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King Louis XVI  and Louise Madeleine Le Peletier de Rosanbo narrowly escaped the guillotine due to the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in           Under the Bourbon Restoration  Tocqueville s father became a noble peer and prefect      Tocqueville attended the Lyc e Fabert in Metz        The Fabert School in Metz  where Tocqueville was a student between      and      Tocqueville  who despised the July Monarchy              began his political career in       From      to       he served as member of the lower house of parliament for the Manche department  Valognes   He sat on the centre left          defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade while supporting the colonisation of Algeria carried on by Louis Philippe s regime  In       he sought to found a Young Left  Jeune Gauche  party which would advocate wage increases  a progressive tax      and other labor concerns in order to undermine the appeal of the socialists      Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of Manche in      and became the president of the department s general council between      and       he resigned as he refused to pledge allegiance to the Second Empire  According to one account  Tocqueville s political position became untenable during this time in the sense that he was mistrusted by both the left and right and was looking for an excuse to leave France       Travels edit  In       Tocqueville obtained from the July Monarchy a mission to examine prisons and penitentiaries in the United States and proceeded there with his lifelong friend Gustave de Beaumont  While he did visit some prisons  Tocqueville traveled widely in the United States and took extensive notes about his observations and reflections      He returned within nine months and published a report  but the real result of his tour was De la d mocratie en Am rique  which appeared in          Beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in Jacksonian America  Marie or Slavery in the United States             During this trip  he made a side trip to Montreal and Quebec City in Lower Canada from mid August to early September           Apart from North America  Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England  producing Memoir on Pauperism  In      and       he traveled to Algeria  His first travel inspired his Travail sur l Alg rie  in which he criticized the French model of colonisation based on an assimilationist view  preferring instead the British model of indirect rule  which avoided mixing different populations together  He went as far as openly advocating racial segregation between the European colonists and the Arabs through the implementation of two different legislative systems  a half century before implementation of the      Indigenous code based on religion    In       Tocqueville made a journey through Ireland  His observations provide one of the best pictures of how Ireland stood before the Great Famine              The observations chronicle the growing Catholic middle class and the appalling conditions in which most Catholic tenant farmers lived  Tocqueville made clear both his opposition to aristocratic power and his affinity for his Irish co religionists      After the fall of the July Monarchy during the February      Revolution  Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of       where he became a member of the commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the Second Republic              He defended bicameralism and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage  As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of Paris  universal suffrage was conceived as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of Paris  During the Second Republic  Tocqueville sided with the Party of Order against the socialists  A few days after the February insurrection  he believed that a violent clash between the Parisian workers  population led by socialists agitating in favour of a  Democratic and Social Republic  and the conservatives  which included the aristocracy and the rural population  was inescapable  As Tocqueville had foreseen  these social tensions eventually exploded during the June Days Uprising of           Led by General Cavaignac  the suppression was supported by Tocqueville  who advocated the  regularization  of the state of siege declared by Cavaignac and other measures promoting suspension of the constitutional order      Between May and September  Tocqueville participated in the Constitutional Commission which wrote the new Constitution  His proposals underlined the importance of his North American experience as his amendment about the President and his reelection       Minister of Foreign Affairs edit   Tocqueville at the       Commission de la r vision de la Constitution   l Assembl e nationale  A supporter of Cavaignac and of the Party of Order  Tocqueville accepted an invitation to enter Odilon Barrot s government as Minister of Foreign Affairs from   June to    October       During the troubled days of June       he pleaded with Interior Minister Jules Armand Dufaure for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators  Tocqueville  who since February      had supported laws restricting political freedoms  approved the two laws voted immediately after the June      days which restricted the liberty of clubs and freedom of the press      This active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in Democracy in America  According to Tocqueville  he favored order as  the sine qua non for the conduct of serious politics  He  hoped  to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change       Tocqueville had supported Cavaignac against Louis Napol on Bonaparte for the presidential election of       Opposed to Louis Napol on Bonaparte s   December      coup which followed his election  Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the   th arrondissement of Paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for  high treason  as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office  Detained at Vincennes and then released  Tocqueville  who supported the Restoration of the Bourbons against Napoleon III s Second Empire              quit political life and retreated to his castle  Ch teau de Tocqueville       Against this image of Tocqueville  biographer Joseph Epstein has concluded   Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot  He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed had given it  in all  thirteen years of his life         He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight  but conducting it now from libraries  archives  and his own desk       There  he began the draft of L Ancien R gime et la R volution  publishing the first tome in       but leaving the second one unfinished   Death edit  A longtime sufferer from bouts of tuberculosis  Tocqueville would eventually succumb to the disease on    April      and was buried in the Tocqueville cemetery in Normandy  citation needed  Tocqueville s professed religion was Roman Catholicism      He saw religion as being compatible with both equality and individualism  but felt that religion would be strongest when separated from politics       Democracy in America edit  Main article  Democracy in America  A page from original working manuscript of Democracy in America  c       In Democracy in America  published in       Tocqueville wrote of the New World and its burgeoning democratic order  Observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist  Tocqueville wrote of his travels through the United States in the early   th century when the Market Revolution  Western expansion and Jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the fabric of American life      According to political scientist Joshua Kaplan  one purpose of writing Democracy in America was to help the people of France get a better understanding of their position between a fading aristocratic order and an emerging democratic order and to help them sort out the confusion      Tocqueville saw democracy as an equation that balanced liberty and equality  concern for the individual as well as for the community  citation needed  Tocqueville was an ardent supporter of liberty   I have a passionate love for liberty  law  and respect for rights   he wrote   I am neither of the revolutionary party nor of the conservative        Liberty is my foremost passion   He wrote of  Political Consequences of the Social State of the Anglo Americans  by saying   But one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality  which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level  and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom       The above is often misquoted as a slavery quote because of previous translations of the French text  The most recent translation by Arthur Goldhammer in      translates the meaning to be as stated above  Examples of misquoted sources are numerous on the internet      but the text does not contain the words  Americans were so enamored by equality  anywhere  citation needed  His view on government reflects his belief in liberty and the need for individuals to be able to act freely while respecting others  rights  Of centralized government  he wrote that it  excels in preventing  not doing       Tocqueville continues to comment on equality by saying   Furthermore  when citizens are all almost equal  it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power  As none of them is strong enough to fight alone with advantage  the only guarantee of liberty is for everyone to combine forces  But such a combination is not always in evidence       Tocqueville explicitly cites inequality as being incentive for the poor to become rich and notes that it is not often that two generations within a family maintain success and that it is inheritance laws that split and eventually break apart someone s estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and the rich  thereby over generations making the poor rich and the rich poor  He cites protective laws in France at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs  thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in      within the United States  citation needed   On civil and political society and the individual edit  Part of a series onLiberalism

media   Liberalism portal  Politics portalvte Tocqueville s main purpose was to analyze the functioning of political society and various forms of political associations  although he brought some reflections on civil society too  and relations between political and civil society   For Tocqueville  as for Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx  civil society was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by civil code      As a critic of individualism  Tocqueville thought that through associating the coming together of people for mutual purpose  both in public and private  Americans are able to overcome selfish desires  thus making both a self conscious and active political society and a vibrant civil society functioning according to political and civil laws of the state          According to political scientist Joshua Kaplan  Tocqueville did not originate the concept of individualism  instead he changed its meaning and saw it as a  calm and considered feeling which deposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and to withdraw into the circle of family and friends         W ith this little society formed to his taste  he gladly leaves the greater society to look for itself       While Tocqueville saw egotism and selfishness as vices  he saw individualism as not a failure of feeling  but as a way of thinking about things which could have either positive consequences such as a willingness to work together  or negative consequences such as isolation and that individualism could be remedied by improved understanding      When individualism was a positive force and prompted people to work together for common purposes and seen as  self interest properly understood   then it helped to counterbalance the danger of the tyranny of the majority since people could  take control over their own lives  without government aid      According to Kaplan  Americans have a difficult time accepting Tocqueville s criticism of the stifling intellectual effect of the  omnipotence of the majority  and that Americans tend to deny that there is a problem in this regard       Others such as the Catholic writer Daniel Schwindt disagree with Kaplan s interpretation  arguing instead that Tocqueville saw individualism as just another form of egotism and not an improvement over it      To make his case  Schwindt provides citations such as the following  Egoism springs from a blind instinct  individualism from wrong headed thinking rather than from depraved feelings  It originates as much from defects of intelligence as from the mistakes of the heart  Egoism blights the seeds of every virtue  individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue  In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism      On democracy and new forms of tyranny edit  Part of a series onConservatism Variants Cultural Fiscal Green Liberal Libertarian National Neo New

equality could lead to the materialism of an expanding bourgeoisie and to the selfishness of individualism   In such conditions  we might become so enamored with  a relaxed love of present enjoyments  that we lose interest in the future of our descendants   and meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one   wrote The New Yorker s James Wood      Tocqueville worried that if despotism were to take root in a modern democracy  it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the Roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time      In contrast  a despotism under a democracy could see  a multitude of men   uniformly alike  equal   constantly circling for petty pleasures   unaware of fellow citizens and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an  immense protective power       Tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens  children  as  perpetual children  and which does not break men s wills  but rather guides it and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a  flock of timid animals        On American social contract edit  Tocqueville s penetrating analysis sought to understand the peculiar nature of American political life  In describing the American  he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power  but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors  Tocqueville tried to understand why the United States was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy  In contrast to the aristocratic ethic  the United States was a society where hard work and money making was the dominant ethic  where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented  where commoners never deferred to elites and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree  citation needed  Tocqueville writes   Among a democratic people  where there is no hereditary wealth  every man works to earn a living        Labor is held in honor  the prejudice is not against but in its favor       Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old world ethics and social arrangements  Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails  resulting in more widely distributed land holdings  This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child  usually a man  inherited the estate  which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation      In contrast  landed elites in the United States were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture  which meant that as time went by large estates became broken up within a few generations which in turn made the children more equal overall      According to Joshua Kaplan s Tocqueville  it was not always a negative development since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings  characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern      Overall  hereditary fortunes in the new democracies became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living  citation needed    A sketch of Tocqueville As Tocqueville understood it  this rapidly democratizing society had a population devoted to  middling  values which wanted to amass through hard work vast fortunes  In Tocqueville s mind  this explained why the United States was so different from Europe  In Europe  he claimed  nobody cared about making money  The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth while the upper classes found it crass  vulgar and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money and many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted  At the same time in the United States  workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries  citation needed  Despite maintaining that the balance of property determined the balance of power  Tocqueville argued that as the United States showed  equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men  In fact  it did quite the opposite as the widespread  relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished the United States and determined its mores and values also explained why the United States masses held elites in such contempt       On majority rule and mediocrity edit  Beyond the eradication of old world aristocracy  ordinary Americans also refused to defer to those possessing  as Tocqueville put it  superior talent and intelligence and these natural elites could not enjoy much share in political power as a result  Ordinary Americans enjoyed too much power and claimed too great a voice in the public sphere to defer to intellectual superiors  This culture promoted a relatively pronounced equality  Tocqueville argued  but the same mores and opinions that ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity  Those who possessed true virtue and talent were left with limited choices      Tocqueville said that those with the most education and intelligence were left with two choices  They could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society  or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector  He wrote that he did not know of any country where there was  less independence of mind  and true freedom of discussion  than in America       Tocqueville blamed the omnipotence of majority rule as a chief factor in stifling thinking   The majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence  A writer is free inside that area  but woe to the man who goes beyond it  not that he stands in fear of an inquisition  but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution  A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys       According to Kaplan s interpretation of Tocqueville  he argued in contrast to previous political thinkers that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong  but that people were  too weak  and felt powerless as the danger is that people felt  swept up in something that they could not control        On slavery  blacks and Indians edit  Uniquely positioned at a crossroads in American history  Tocqueville s Democracy in America attempted to capture the essence of American culture and values  Though a supporter of colonialism  Tocqueville could clearly perceive the evils that black people and natives had been subjected to in the United States  Tocqueville devoted the last chapter of the first volume of Democracy in America to the question while his travel companion Gustave de Beaumont wholly focused on slavery and its fallouts for the American nation in Marie or Slavery in America  Tocqueville notes among the American races  The first who attracts the eye  the first in enlightenment  in power and in happiness  is the white man  the European  man par excellence  below him appear the Negro and the Indian  These two unfortunate races have neither birth  nor face  nor language  nor mores in common  only their misfortunes look alike  Both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit  both experience the effects of tyranny  and if their miseries are different  they can accuse the same author for them      Tocqueville contrasted the settlers of Virginia with the middle class  religious Puritans who founded New England and analyzed the debasing influence of slavery  The men sent to Virginia were seekers of gold  adventurers without resources and without character  whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony        Artisans and agriculturalists arrived afterwards          hardly in any respect above the level of the inferior classes in England  No lofty views  no spiritual conception presided over the foundation of these new settlements  The colony was scarcely established when slavery was introduced  this was the capital fact which was to exercise an immense influence on the character  the laws and the whole future of the South  Slavery       dishonors labor  it introduces idleness into society  and with idleness  ignorance and pride  luxury and distress  It enervates the powers of the mind and benumbs the activity of man  On this same English foundation there developed in the North very different characteristics      Tocqueville concluded that return of the Negro population to Africa could not resolve the problem as he writes at the end of Democracy in America  If the colony of Liberia were able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year  and if the Negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage  if the Union were to supply the society with annual subsidies  and to transport the Negroes to Africa in government vessels  it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population among the blacks  and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born upon its territory within that time  it could not prevent the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the states  The Negro race will never leave those shores of the American continent to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of Europeans  and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it continues to exist  The inhabitants of the United States may retard the calamities which they apprehend  but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause  In       Tocqueville wrote the following text published by Maria Weston Chapman in the Liberty Bell  Testimony against Slavery  I do not think it is for me  a foreigner  to indicate to the United States the time  the measures  or the men by whom Slavery shall be abolished  Still  as the persevering enemy of despotism everywhere  and under all its forms  I am pained and astonished by the fact that the freest people in the world is  at the present time  almost the only one among civilized and Christian nations which yet maintains personal servitude  and this while serfdom itself is about disappearing  where it has not already disappeared  from the most degraded nations of Europe An old and sincere friend of America  I am uneasy at seeing Slavery retard her progress  tarnish her glory  furnish arms to her detractors  compromise the future career of the Union which is the guaranty of her safety and greatness  and point out beforehand to her  to all her enemies  the spot where they are to strike  As a man  too  I am moved at the spectacle of man s degradation by man  and I hope to see the day when the law will grant equal civil liberty to all the inhabitants of the same empire  as God accords the freedom of the will  without distinction  to the dwellers upon earth      On policies of assimilation edit  According to Tocqueville  assimilation of black people would be almost impossible and this was already being demonstrated in the Northern states  As Tocqueville predicted  formal freedom and equality and segregation would become this population s reality after the Civil War and during Reconstruction as would the bumpy road to true integration of black people  citation needed  However  assimilation was the best solution for Native Americans  and since they were too proud to assimilate  they would inevitably become extinct  Displacement was another part of America s Indian policy  Both populations were  undemocratic   or without the qualities  intellectual and otherwise needed to live in a democracy  Tocqueville shared many views on assimilation and segregation of his and the coming epochs  but he opposed Arthur de Gobineau s theories as found in The Inequality of Human Races                   On the United States and Russia as future global powers edit  In his Democracy in America  Tocqueville also forecast the preeminence of the United States and Russia as the two main global powers  In his book  he stated   There are now two great nations in the world  which starting from different points  seem to be advancing toward the same goal  the Russians and the Anglo Americans        Each seems called by some secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world        On civil jury service edit  Tocqueville believed that the American jury system was particularly important in educating citizens in self government and rule of law      He often expressed how the civil jury system was one of the most effective showcases of democracy because it connected citizens with the true spirit of the justice system  In his      treatise Democracy in America  he explained   The jury  and more especially the civil jury  serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens  and this spirit  with the habits which attend it  is the soundest preparation for free institutions        It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy  it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge toward society  and the part which they take in the Government       Tocqueville believed that jury service not only benefited the society as a whole  but enhanced jurors  qualities as citizens  Because of the jury system   they were better informed about the rule of law  and they were more closely connected to the state  Thus  quite independently of what the jury contributed to dispute resolution  participation on the jury had salutary effects on the jurors themselves             discourse on the Conquest of Algeria edit  French historian of colonialism Olivier LeCour Grandmaison has underlined how Tocqueville  as well as Jules Michelet  used the term  extermination  to describe what was happening during the colonization of Western United States and the Indian removal period      Tocqueville thus expressed himself in      concerning the conquest of Algeria  As far as I am concerned  I came back from Africa with the pathetic notion that at present in our way of waging war we are far more barbaric than the Arabs themselves  These days  they represent civilization  we do not  This way of waging war seems to me as stupid as it is cruel  It can only be found in the head of a coarse and brutal soldier  Indeed  it was pointless to replace the Turks only to reproduce what the world rightly found so hateful in them  This  even for the sake of interest is more noxious than useful  for  as another officer was telling me  if our sole aim is to equal the Turks  in fact we shall be in a far lower position than theirs  barbarians for barbarians  the Turks will always outdo us because they are Muslim barbarians  In France  I have often heard men I respect but do not approve of  deplore that crops should be burnt and granaries emptied and finally that unarmed men  women  and children should be seized  In my view these are unfortunate circumstances that any people wishing to wage war against the Arabs must accept  I think that all the means available to wreck tribes must be used  barring those that the human kind and the right of nations condemn  I personally believe that the laws of war enable us to ravage the country and that we must do so either by destroying the crops at harvest time or any time by making fast forays also known as raids the aim of which it to get hold of men or flocks          Whatever the case  we may say in a general manner that all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria      Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons  first  his understanding of the international situation and France s position in the world  and second  changes in French society      Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would  restore national pride  threatened   he believed  by  the gradual softening of social mores  in the middle classes  Their taste for  material pleasures  was spreading to the whole of society  giving it  an example of weakness and egotism       Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud  Tocqueville went so far to claim that  war in Africa is a science  Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success  One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread  perfected and made everyone aware of this new science       Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations  one for European colonists and one for the Arab population      Such a two tier arrangement would be fully realised with the      Cr mieux decree and the Indigenousness Code  which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second class citizenship  citation needed   Tocqueville s opposition to the invasion of Kabylie edit        caricature by Honor  Daumier In opposition to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison  Jean Louis Beno t said that given the extent of racial prejudices during the colonization of Algeria  Tocqueville was one of its  most moderate supporters   Beno t said that it was wrong to assume Tocqueville was a supporter of Bugeaud despite his      apologetic discourse  It seems that Tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to Algeria in      as he criticized Bugeaud s desire to invade Kabylie in an      speech to the Assembly  citation needed  Although Tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law  administrators  schools and so on for Arabs who had come under French control  he judged the Berber tribes of Kabylie  in his second of Two Letters on Algeria        as  savages  not suited for this arrangement because he argued they would best be managed not by force of arms  but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction      Tocqueville s views on the matter were complex  Although in his      report on Algeria he applauded Bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated Abd el Kader s resistance  he had advocated in the Two Letters that the French military advance leave Kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into Kabylie  citation needed  In the debate about the      extraordinary funds  Tocqueville denounced Bugeaud s conduct of military operations and succeeded in convincing the Assembly not to vote funds in support of Bugeaud s military columns      Tocqueville considered Bugeaud s plan to invade Kabylie despite the opposition of the Assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice                 Report on Algeria  edit  In his       Report on Algeria   Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the European colonization of the Americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences      More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged  colonization will end in a blood bath  Tocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria  including the various Arab tribes  independent Kabyles living in the Atlas Mountains and the powerful political leader Abd el Kader  In his various letters and essays on Algeria  Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country can approach imperialism  In particular  the author differentiates between what he terms  dominance  and a particular version of  colonization       The latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth  In the case of Algeria  the Port of Algiers and the control over the Strait of Gibraltar were considered by Tocqueville to be particularly valuable whereas direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria was not  Thus  the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas      Tocqueville argued that though unpleasant  domination via violent means is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war  Such laws are not discussed in detail  but given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self defense  it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with just war theory s jus ad bellum criteria of just cause  Further  given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory  his approach does not accord with just war theory s jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination       The Old Regime and the Revolution edit  Main article  The Old Regime and the Revolution In       Tocqueville published The Old Regime and the Revolution  The book analyzes French society before the French Revolution the so called Ancien R gime and investigates the forces that caused the Revolution  citation needed   References in popular literature edit  Tocqueville was quoted in several chapters of Toby Young s memoirs How to Lose Friends and Alienate People to explain his observation of widespread homogeneity of thought even amongst intellectual elites at Harvard University during his time spent there  He is frequently quoted and studied in American history classes  Tocqueville is the inspiration for Australian novelist Peter Carey in his      novel Parrot and Olivier in America       Works edit  Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave de
