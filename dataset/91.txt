 G satellite in late       Broadcast of video tests began in HD in December       with SD following shortly thereafter  The channel was officially made available on    February       Ahead of the launch  it had been suggested that the network would begin on satellite  then launch on Freeview in the spring  however  in practice the channel went live on all four of the UK s main TV platforms on the same date  The free to air channel was also made available on Freesat  The Freesat broadcast uses an HD swap out system similar to that used by Channel    S C and TRT World  Smithsonian Channel has also been made available on the Virgin Media cable platform  As Virgin no longer supplies SD receivers to its customers  only the HD version of the channel is available on cable  Prior to the channel s launch it had been indicated that Smithsonian Channel would be made available to Freeview devices  in the spring     In practice  though  capacity on the Arqiva operated COM  multiplex was secured to enable the channel to go live at the same time as on other platforms  Smithsonian eventually moved to provide increased coverage  Only the standard definition version of Smithsonian broadcasts on a DVB T multiplex alongside other SD channels  so most homes can receive the channel with their DVB T receivers on channel number     Advance weekly listings for the Smithsonian Channel were carried in Radio Times magazine from February       On January          following the closure of  Spike  Smithsonian Channel moved to channel    on Freeview  On March          the channel moved to channel     on Sky following closure of VH  to prevent the slot from no longer being able to be reused  later to move to channel     there on    April      to allow Sky plc to move Challenge to
