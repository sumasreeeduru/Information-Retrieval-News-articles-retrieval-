March      at      pm GMT  having been delayed from the original planned      launch  BBC Four began originally as a late schedule to BBC Two  before it received its own channel  along with BBC Three  Curiously  BBC Four had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans  The channel replaced BBC Knowledge  an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime  in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming  essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule  BBC Four would rebrand this channel  and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time  Planning for the new channel  along with the new BBC Three  had been in progress since October       however  the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans  The BBC Four plans were approved earlier  and as a result launched before BBC Three  BBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge  the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast    hours a day  This was because on the Freeview digital terrestrial platform  BBC Four is broadcast in a statistically multiplexed stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the CBeebies channel  which is on air from       until         As a result  BBC Four broadcasts from       to around       each night  with an hour s down time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel s schedule  On    May       BBC Four was added to the Sky EPG in the Republic of Ireland on channel      It later moved to EPG     to free up space for new channels     It later moved to channel     on   May      to sit beside BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland there  and the    s being used for    channels     On    August       BBC Four announced BBC      a special two nights of programming which would revolve around artificial intelligence  AI  selecting the programmes broadcast on the channel  based on  what BBC Four audiences might like  based on the channel s previous schedules and programme attributes   It would then   rank  programmes it thought were most relevant  to what BBC Four viewers would like       The programming was aired on the nights of   and   September          This included a few special programmes about AI      such as  Made by Machine  When AI Met The Archive   which documented how the AI works     and  The Joy of AI   where  the emergence of machine learning  is discussed  as well as  why  AI  shouldn t spook us           On    February       Virgin Media stopped providing BBC Four in standard definition      Due to the launch of BBC Scotland on    February       BBC Four has been on a lower Freeview EPG number in Scotland than elsewhere  moving to    to make room for BBC Scotland  Following eventual closures  it moved to channel    there  and later to channel     and eventually channel         On   November       due to Ofcom proposals regarding certain PSB channels requiring greater prominence on each UK TV provider s channel listing  BBC Four moved to channel    in Scotland  while every channel from that number  ITV   to channel      SELECT  moved down one place      In May       the BBC submitted its annual general plan for          which included a proposal for BBC Two to supplant BBC Four as its main outlet for specialist programmes  Under the plan  BBC Four would cease originating new programmes  and become a service showcasing the BBC s  rich archive   The plan also included the possibility of the BBC expanding BBC Four into a global brand  to   take  our strengths in specialist factual to the world stage                Organisation edit  The channel direction is determined by the channel s remit  set by royal charter and the corporation s governing body  the BBC Board   and by the channel controller  In October       following the departure of Richard Klein from the controllership  the management of the channel changed  with the role of Controller of BBC Four scrapped  from this point the Controller of BBC Two would have ultimate oversight of BBC Four as part of their role  absorbing some of the former duties of the Controller of BBC Four  but a new  Channel Editor  post  reporting up to this controller  would be created to take day to day charge of Four  The controllers of BBC Four from      to      have been              Roly Keating            Janice Hadlow                Richard Klein                Janice Hadlow  as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four   on an interim basis        Hadlow had been Controller of BBC Two since departing BBC Four in      Early       Adam Barker  interim Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four following Janice Hadlow s departure to a new post                 Kim Shillinglaw  as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four      Channel Editors of BBC Four have been        present  Cassian Harrison     BBC Four has an annual budget of       million     On    January       Kim Shillinglaw announced that she had decided to leave the BBC as the Controller of BBC Two   BBC Four  As a result of the reorganisation  the post of BBC Two and Four control had closed after her departure later that year       BBC Four HD edit  On    July       the BBC announced that a high definition  HD  simulcast of BBC Four would be launched by early           The channel launched on    December      at       GMT  and rolled out nationwide up to June       as did BBC News HD and CBeebies HD       The channel broadcasts on the BBC s new HD multiplex on Freeview and shares its stream with CBeebies HD as they both air at different times  Prior to launch  the majority of BBC Four s HD output was broadcast on the BBC HD channel before its closure on    March       In      BBC Four HD along with CBBC HD and Cbeebies HD launched in Ireland   Programming edit  Main article  List of programmes broadcast by the BBC BBC Four s primary role is to reflect a range of UK and international arts  music and culture  It should provide an ambitious range of innovative  high quality programming that is intellectually and culturally enriching  taking an expert and in depth approach to a wide range of subjects   BBC Four Remit  BBC Four share of viewing           BARB figures The first evening s BBC Four programmes were simulcast on BBC Two     BBC Four is notable for first showing Larry David s Seinfeld follow up  Curb Your Enthusiasm      Armando Iannucci s cutting political satire  The Thick of It  The Chaser s War on Everything  Flight of the Conchords  Mad Men and Danish thriller The Killing  The channel broadcasts a mixture of art and science documentaries  vintage drama  including many rare black and white programmes   and non English language productions such as films from the Artificial Eye catalogue  the French thriller Spiral and the Swedish detective series Wallander      BBC Four further supports foreign language films with its annual World Cinema Award which has been running since       Until the middle of       BBC Four broadcast a global news bulletin on weekdays at       which most recently was a simulcast of Beyond     Days Monday Thursday and an edition of World News Today on Fridays which was produced by BBC World News  This replaced The World and BBC Four News which aired in the slot from the launch of the channel  As of autumn       BBC Four no longer broadcasts a news bulletin  It screens a number of documentaries such as The Century of the Self and The Trials of Henry Kissinger  The channel is also home to many political travel shows such as Holidays in the Axis of Evil which features investigative journalism  Drama has given the channel some of its most popular programmes  with The Alan Clark Diaries        and Kenneth Williams  Fantabulosa         being among the highest rated  with over         viewers  The highly acclaimed Hattie  broadcast in       holds the record for BBC  s best ever consolidated ratings of  m           Before that The Curse of Steptoe brought the channel its highest audience figures  estimated as      million viewers  a    share of multichannel audiences between       and        based on overnight returns      The official audience figures for the broadcast  including time shifting  were later published as                Another notable production was a live re make of the      science fiction serial The Quatermass Experiment  adapted from the original scripts into a single  two hour version  though on the night it  in fact  underran considerably  lasting less than   hour    minutes   broadcast on the evening of Saturday   April       Discounting BBC Four s previous live relays of theatrical Shakespeare productions  this was the first live made for television drama to be broadcast by the BBC for twenty years  Another notable programme broadcast on BBC Four is Charlie Brooker s Screenwipe which contains reviews of current shows  as well as stories and commentary on how television is produced  The show is presented by broadcaster Charlie Brooker  The channel is also curator and leader of the BBC Archive project whose aim is that the BBC s television archive is re broadcast as much as appropriate so that the Archive can be enjoyed again and not isolated      Some output from BBC Four  documentaries rather than foreign films  was for a time repeated on BBC Two in a  BBC Four on Two  branded area  although this was often in a late night broadcast slot after Newsnight and has since been discontinued  According to BARB the comedy panel game QI has the highest ratings of any show on BBC Four      At the Edinburgh International Television Festival  BBC Four won the Non Terrestrial Channel of the Year award in            and       In      Dirk Gently became the first continuing drama series produced for the channel      BBC Four is occasionally used to show live sports coverage  The channel aired additional games from the UEFA Euro      football tournament  and temporarily extended its broadcast hours to show live action from the      Summer Olympics

idents The channel s initial series of idents were generated dynamically reflecting the frequencies of the continuity announcers  voice or of backing music and were designed by Lambie Nairn  As a result  no two idents were ever the same  The first continuity announcer was Zeb Soanes  When the channel first started airing  it used the slogan  Everybody Needs A Place To Think   but the BBC stopped using this several months after the launch  However the BBC Four logo and above slogan can be found  engraved on benches along the South Bank in London  between the London Eye and Waterloo Bridge  On    September       the channel began showing new idents comprising a central BBC Four logo surrounded by four quadrants which show different stages of the same footage thus making for a sort of optical illusion  for example  a swimming pool where a person on an inflatable ring appears in the bottom left corner  though ripples don t enter the remaining quarters  Although the image appears as one at the start of the ident  by the end it is clearly four separate images  In March       BBC Four added several new idents inspired by  oddly satisfying videos  in tandem with the quadrants theme  originally premiering for a programme season honouring the   th anniversary of the World Wide Web   See also edit    BBC portal List of documentary channels BBC Four World Cinema
