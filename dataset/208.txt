founded by Steve Chen  Chad Hurley  and Jawed Karim  who were all early employees of PayPal      Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania  and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign      Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson s role in      Super Bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance  and later from the      Indian Ocean tsunami  Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online  which led to the idea of a video sharing site      Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service  and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not          They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a      reward      Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans  with the site s founders deciding to accept uploads of any type of video      According to a story that has often been repeated in the media  Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of       after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen s apartment in San Francisco  Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred  but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party  was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible         The YouTube logo was used from its launch until       Another version of this logo without their  Broadcast Yourself  slogan was used until       YouTube began as a venture capital funded technology startup  primarily from an       million investment by Sequoia Capital and an    million investment from Artis Capital Management between November      and April               YouTube s early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Mateo  California      The domain name www youtube com was activated on February           and the website was developed over the subsequent months      The first YouTube video  titled Me at the zoo  shows co founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo      The video was uploaded on April           and can still be viewed on the site      YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May       The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in November               Following a      million investment from Sequoia Capital in November  the site launched officially on December           by which time the site was receiving   million views a day          At the time of the official launch  YouTube did not have much market recognition  It was not the first video sharing site on the Internet  as Vimeo was launched in November       though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor at the time and did not grow much either      The week of YouTube s launch  NBC Universal s Saturday Night Live ran a skit  Lazy Sunday  by The Lonely Island  Besides helping to bolster ratings and long term viewership for Saturday Night Live   Lazy Sunday  s status as an early viral video helped established YouTube as an important website      Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February      before they were removed at request of NBC Universal about two months later  raising questions of copyright related to viral content      Despite eventually being taken down  these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube s reach and led to the upload of further third party content          The site grew rapidly and  in July       the company announced that more than        new videos were being uploaded every day  and that the site was receiving     million video views per day      The choice of the name www youtube com led to problems for a similarly named website  www utube com  The site s owner  Universal Tube   Rollform Equipment  filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November      after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube  Universal Tube has since changed the name of its website to www utubeonline com           Acquisition by Google             On October          Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for       billion in Google stock          The deal was finalized on November                   Google s acquisition launched new newfound interest in

January               hours every minute in May                   hours every minute in November           and     hours every minute in February           As of January       the site had     million unique users a month      It has been claimed  by The Daily Telegraph in       that in       YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in           According to third party web analytics providers  Alexa and SimilarWeb  YouTube is the second most visited website in the world  as of December      update   SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally

Home Feed  Videos Playlists  Discussion  About  rather than one unified page       New revenue streams       ongoing  In May       YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer

major expansion of the service into Canada and    European markets   as well as the upcoming launch of a separate YouTube Music subscription      In September       YouTube began to phase out the separate YouTube Gaming website and app and introduced a new Gaming portal within the main service  YouTube staff argued that the separate platform was causing confusion and that the integration would allow the features developed for the service  including game based portals and enhanced discoverability of gaming related videos and live streaming  to reach a broader audience through the main YouTube website      In July       It was announced that YouTube will discontinue support for Nintendo  DS systems on September          However  owners of New Nintendo  DS  or New Nintendo  DS XL

of           As of August       the classic studio is no longer available      During the COVID    pandemic  when most of the world was under stay at home orders  usage of services such as YouTube grew greatly  In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information  YouTube along with Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by     to comply with the EU s request      YouTube later announced that they will continue with this move worldwide   We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation       In June       the ability to use categories was phased out  citation needed   Features Video technology YouTube primarily uses the VP  and H     MPEG   AVC video formats  and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol      By January       YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV  format       Playback Previously  viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug in to be installed in the browser      In January       YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML  standard      This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug in to be installed          The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML  trial  Only browsers that supported HTML  Video using the MP   with H     video  or WebM  with VP  video  formats could play the videos  and not all videos on the site were available          On January           YouTube announced that HTML  would be the default playback method on supported browsers  YouTube used to employ Adobe Dynamic Streaming for Flash      but with the switch to HTML  video now streams video using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP  MPEG DASH   an adaptive bit rate HTTP based streaming solution optimizing the bitrate and quality for the available network       Uploading All YouTube users can upload videos up to    minutes each in duration  Users can verify their account  normally through a mobile phone  to gain the ability to upload videos up to    hours in length  as well as produce live streams           When YouTube was launched in       it was possible to upload longer videos  but a ten minute limit was introduced in March      after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films       The    minute limit was increased to    minutes in July            In the past  it was possible to upload videos longer than    hours  Videos can be at most     GB in size      Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded  Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate  so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy       YouTube formerly offered a  Community Captions  feature  where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader  but this was deprecated on September            Captions that have already been added using the feature will be retained        YouTube accepts nearly all consumer video and audio encodings  including but not limited to MPEG    MPEG    H     AVC  H     HEVC  VC    VP   VP   and AV  for video and MP   linear PCM  AAC  FLAC  Vorbis  Opus  and Dolby Digital  also known as AC    for audio  Nearly any container format can be used  including but not limited to MP   Matroska  FLV  AVI  WebM   GP  MPEG PS  and the QuickTime File Format  Some intermediate video formats  i e   primarily used for professional video editing  not for final delivery or storage  are also accepted  such as ProRes       YouTube does stipulate a  recommended  upload format to maximize the quality of the transcoded video that will be shown to viewers  as of late      this is H     AVC video and AAC audio in an MP  container       Videos with progressive scanning or interlaced scanning can be uploaded  but for the best video quality  YouTube suggests interlaced videos be deinterlaced before uploading  All the video formats on YouTube use progressive scanning       YouTube s statistics shows that interlaced videos are still being uploaded to YouTube  and there is no sign of that dwindling  YouTube attributes this to uploading of made for TV content        Quality and formats YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level  displayed at a resolution of         pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec  a variant of H                 with mono MP  audio       In June       YouTube added an option to watch videos in  GP format on mobile phones       In March       a high quality mode was added  which increased the resolution to         pixels       In December          p HD support was added  At the time of the    p launch  the YouTube player was changed from a     aspect ratio to a widescreen            With this new feature  YouTube began a switchover to H     MPEG   AVC as its default video compression format  In November           p HD support was added  In July       YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in  K format  which allows a resolution of up to           pixels            In March       support for  K resolution was added  with the videos playing at             pixels  In June       support for  K resolution was added  with the videos playing at           pixels       In November       support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with Hybrid Log Gamma  HLG  or Perceptual Quantizer  PQ        HDR video can be encoded with the Rec       color space       In June       YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to    frames per second  as opposed to    before   becoming available for user uploads in October  YouTube stated that this would enhance  motion intensive  videos  such as video game footage                      YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels  The former names of standard quality  SQ   high quality  HQ   and high definition  HD  have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video  The default video stream is encoded in the VP  format with stereo Opus audio  if VP  WebM is not supported in the browser device or the browser s user agent reports Windows XP  then H     MPEG   AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead             picture quality cut On March           Thierry Breton  a European commissioner in charge of digital policy of the European Union urged streaming services including YouTube to limit their services  The request came as a result of the prevention of Europe s broadband networks from crashing as tens of millions of people started telecommuting  due to the COVID    pandemic in Europe  According to the EU  the streaming platforms should consider offering only standard definition  rather than high definition  programs and users should be responsible for their data consumption       On March     YouTube responded by temporarily downgrading the videos in standard definition across the EU including the traffic in the UK as well             Annotations From      to       users could add  annotations  to their videos such as pop up text messages and hyperlinks  These functions were notably used as the basis for interactive videos  which used hyperlinks to other videos to achieve branching elements  In March       it was announced that the annotations editor had been discontinued and the feature would be sunset because their use had fallen rapidly  users had found them to be an annoyance  and because they were incompatible with mobile versions of the service  Annotations were removed entirely from all videos on January           YouTube had introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross platform manner  including  end screens   a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video  and  cards   but they are not backwards compatible with existing annotations  while the removal of annotations will also break all interactive experiences which depended on them                       Live streaming YouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming  including a concert by U  in       and a question and answer session with US President Barack Obama in February            These tests had relied on technology from  rd party partners  but in September       YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure       In April       YouTube announced the rollout of YouTube Live  with a portal page at the URL  www youtube com live   The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners       It was used for real time broadcasting of events such as the      Olympics in London       In October       more than   million people watched Felix Baumgartner s jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube       In May       creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least       subscribers  in August of that year the number was reduced to     subscribers       and in December the limit was removed       In February       live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app  Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least        subscribers       but as of mid      it has been reduced to     subscribers       Live streams can be up to  K resolution at    fps  and also support      video       In February       a live streaming feature called Super Chat was introduced  which allows viewers to donate between    and      to have their comment highlighted         D videos In a video posted on July                YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users could now upload  D videos  The videos can be viewed in several different ways  including the common anaglyph  cyan red lens  method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the  D effect                 The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows  columns or a checkerboard pattern  side by side or anaglyph using a red cyan  green magenta or blue yellow combination  In May       an HTML  version of the YouTube player began supporting side by side  D footage that is compatible with Nvidia  D Vision       The feature set has since been reduced  and the  D feature currently only supports red cyan anaglyph with no side by side support       degree videos In January       Google announced that     degree video would be natively supported on YouTube  On March           YouTube enabled      videos which can be viewed from

     YouTube began to promote an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR     which is limited to a     degree field of view but is promoted as being easier to produce than     degree video and allowing more depth to be maintained by not subjecting the video to equirectangular projection        User features Community On September           YouTube launched a public beta of Community  a social media based feature that allows users to post text  images  including GIFs   live videos and others in a separate  Community  tab on their channel       Prior to the release  several creators

subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos            In April       YouTube set an eligibility requirement of        lifetime views for a paid subscription       On January           the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to       hours of watchtime within the past    months and       subscribers       The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy  but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels       YouTube Play Buttons  a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards  are a

advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos  the company retains     of the ad revenue       In       it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders  YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue       In May       Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games       In February       Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators                  Controversies YouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site s features  Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content  videos of animal abuse  shock videos  content uploaded without the copyright holder s consent  hate speech  spam  and predatory behavior       Despite the guidelines  YouTube has faced criticism from news sources for retaining content in violation of these guidelines   Copyrighted material At the time of uploading a video  YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws       Despite this advice  many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube  YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online  and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act  Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike  Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted            Organizations including Viacom  Mediaset  and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube  claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material                 Viacom  demanding    billion in damages  said that it had found more than         unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed  an astounding     billion times   YouTube responded by stating that it  goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works        During the same court battle  Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over    terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site  The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation  which called the court ruling  a setback to privacy rights             In June       Viacom s lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment  with U S  federal Judge Louis L  Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling       On April          the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the case  allowing Viacom s lawsuit against Google to be heard in court again       On March           the lawsuit was settled after seven years with an undisclosed agreement       In August       a US court ruled in Lenz v  Universal Music Corp  that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material  The case involved Stephanie Lenz from Gallitzin  Pennsylvania  who had made a home video of her    month old son dancing to Prince s song  Let s Go Crazy   and posted the    second video on YouTube       In the case of Smith v  Summit Entertainment LLC  professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube       He asserted seven causes of action  and four were ruled in Smith s favor       In April       a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users  The performance rights organization GEMA argued that YouTube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of German copyrighted music  YouTube responded by stating   We remain committed to finding a solution to the music licensing issue in Germany that will benefit artists  composers  authors  publishers  and record labels  as well as the wider YouTube community       On November          the dispute with GEMA was resolved  with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA       In April       it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored  even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter notice  When a dispute occurs  the uploader of the video has to contact UMG            YouTube s owner Google announced in November      that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply        Content ID Main article  Content ID  algorithm  In June       YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright  Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom  which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute       The system  which was initially called  Video Identification            and later became known as Content ID       creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material  and stores it in a database  When a video is uploaded  it is checked against the database  and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found       When this occurs  the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable  tracking the viewing statistics of the video  or adding advertisements to the video   By       YouTube had  already invested tens of millions of dollars in this technology        In       YouTube described Content ID as  very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File        By       Content ID accounted for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube       An independent test in      uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was  surprisingly resilient  in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos  it was not infallible       The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases  as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use       If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID  it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision       Before       videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved  Since April       videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress  and the money goes to whoever won the dispute       Should the uploader want to monetize the video again  they may remove the disputed audio in the  Video Manager        YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site s rules were modified in December      to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length        Controversial videos See also  Criticism of Google   YouTube  and Censorship by Google   YouTube YouTube has also faced criticism over the handling of offensive content in some of its videos  The uploading of videos containing defamation  pornography  and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube s  Community Guidelines        YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate  and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site s guidelines       To limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube  it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how to planned to deal with technically manipulated videos       YouTube has also been criticized for suppressing opinions dissenting from governments  positions  especially related to the COVID    pandemic                  Public disasters Controversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster  in which    football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in                 In July       the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was  unimpressed  with YouTube s system for policing its videos  and argued that  proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user generated content   YouTube responded by stating   We have strict rules on what s allowed  and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our      review team and have it dealt with promptly  We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users  Given the volume of content uploaded on our site  we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly        July       Imam Anwar al Awlaki In October       U S  Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al Awlaki       YouTube pulled some of the videos in November       stating they violated the site s guidelines       In December       YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content        PRISM Following media reports about PRISM  NSA s massive electronic surveillance program  in June       several technology companies were identified as participants  including YouTube  According to leaks from the program  YouTube joined the PRISM program in             Restricted monetization policies YouTube s policies on  advertiser friendly content  restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized  this includes strong violence  language       sexual content  and  controversial or sensitive subjects and events  including subjects related to war  political conflicts  natural disasters and tragedies  even if graphic imagery is not shown   unless the content is  usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator s intent is to inform or entertain        In September       after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations  YouTube s policies were criticized by prominent users  including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers  DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was  censorship by a different name   A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new  the service had  improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators                  Boing Boing reported in      that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization        Advertiser mass boycott In March       the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube  after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content  The government demanded assurances that its advertising would  be delivered safely and appropriately   The Guardian newspaper  as well as other major British and U S  brands  similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content  Google stated that it had  begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear             In early April       the YouTube channel h h Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video  citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader  The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video            On April          YouTube announced that to  ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules   it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review  and have at least        lifetime views  before they may join the Partner Program        Logan Paul corpse scandal In January       YouTube creator Logan Paul faced criticism for a video he had uploaded from a trip to Japan  where he encountered a body of a suicide death in the Aokigahara forest  The corpse was visible in the video  although its face was censored  The video proved controversial due to its content  with its handling of the subject matter being deemed insensitive by critics  On January    eleven days after the video was published YouTube announced that it would cut Paul from the Google Preferred advertising program  Six days later  YouTube announced tighter thresholds for the partner program to  significantly improve our ability to identify creators who contribute positively to the community   under which channels must have at least       hours of watch time within the past    months and at least       subscribers  YouTube also announced that videos approved for the Google Preferred program would become subject to manual review and that videos would be rated based on suitability  with advertisers allowed to choose                  These changes led to further criticism of YouTube from independent channels  who alleged that the service had been changing its algorithms to give higher prominence to professionally produced content  such as celebrities  music videos  and clips from late night talk shows   that attract wide viewership and has a lower risk of alienating mainstream advertisers  at the expense of the creators that had bolstered the service s popularity             Conspiracy theories and fringe discourse YouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories  falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse                 According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal   YouTube s recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories  partisan viewpoints and misleading videos  even when those users haven t shown interest in such content  When users show a political bias in what they choose to view  YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases  often with more extreme viewpoints             When users search for political or scientific terms  YouTube s search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories            After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking news queries during the      Las Vegas shooting  YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources                      In       it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news  giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain s death       In       it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos  including videos by rape apologists  anti Semites  and hate preachers who received ad payouts       After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting  YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed       Alex Jones  known for right wing conspiracy theories  had built a massive audience on YouTube       YouTube drew criticism in      when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones  stating that it violated its policies on  harassment and bullying        On August          however  YouTube removed Alex Jones  YouTube page following a content violation       University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as  The Great Radicalizer   saying  YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the   st century        Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a  conspiracy ecosystem             In January       YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing  content that could misinform users in harmful ways   YouTube gave flat earth theories  miracle cures  and      trutherism as examples       Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech  and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement       In late       the site began implementing measures directed towards  raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation        A July      study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to the climate and climate change  the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change       A      BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube s algorithm promoted health misinformation  including fake cancer cures       In Brazil  YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters  as well as elevated far right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories       Following the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID    pandemic that  G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease      which led to numerous  G towers in the United Kingdom to be destroyed  YouTube removed all such videos linking  G and the coronavirus in this manner        Hateful content Before       YouTube has taken steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site wide policies against hate speech       In the wake of the March      Christchurch mosque attacks  YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech  which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks            These platforms were pressured to remove such content  but in an interview with The New York Times  YouTube s chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer aided algorithms  general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle  and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction       YouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May      to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations  to be implemented at the national level  to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech  though the United States declined to participate            Subsequently  on June          YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service   specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination  segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age  gender  race  caste  religion  sexual orientation or veteran status   YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that  promote or glorify Nazi ideology  which is inherently discriminatory   YouTube further stated it would  remove content denying that well documented violent events  like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary  took place             In June       YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy  including those of Stefan Molyneux  David Duke  and Richard B  Spencer  asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech  The banned occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub forums including r The Donald        Child protection See also  FamilyOFive  Fantastic Adventures scandal  and Elsagate Leading into       there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children  coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family s activities  and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family friendly material  In       YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by                However  with the increase in videos featuring children  the site began to face several controversies related to child safety  During Q        the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive  which featured themselves playing  pranks  on their children  were accused of child abuse  Their videos were eventually deleted  and two of their children were removed from their custody                      A similar case happened in      when the owners of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children  Her videos would later be deleted       Later that year  YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent  sexual or otherwise disturbing situations  many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views  The term  Elsagate  was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy                      On November           YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content  Later that month  the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters  As part as a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube  the wave of deletions also targeted channels which showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults  Most notably  the company removed Toy Freaks  a channel with over     million subscribers  that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations                           According to analytics specialist SocialBlade  it earned up to      million annually prior to its deletion       Even for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child friendly content  YouTube s system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos  These questions have been raised in the past  as YouTube has had to remove channels with children s content which  after becoming popular  then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children s content       Alternative  some of the most watched children s programming on YouTube comes from channels who have no identifiable owners  raising concerns of intent and purpose  One channel that had been of concern was  Cocomelon  which provided numerous mass produced animated videos aimed at children  Up through       it had drawn up to US    million a month in ad revenue  and was one of the largest kid friendly channels on YouTube before       Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to  Treasure Studio   itself an unknown entity  raising questions as to the channel s purpose                 but Bloomberg News had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February      regarding  Cocomelon   who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children  wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors       The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve       The difficulty to identify who operates these channels  adds to the lack of accountability   according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood  and educational consultant Ren e Chernow O Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate  all leading to both critics and parents to be concerns for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels       Content creators that earnestly make kid friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels like ChuChu TV  unable to produce content at the same rate as these large channels  and lack the same means of being promoted through YouTube s recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared       In January       YouTube officially banned videos containing  challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm   such as  for example  the Tide Pod Challenge   and videos featuring pranks that  make victims believe they re in physical danger  or cause emotional distress in children        Sexualization of children See also  Elsagate Also in November       it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children often uploaded by the minors themselves  and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics were attracting comments from pedophiles           with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian       Other child centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web  and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles       As a result of the controversy  which added to the concern about  Elsagate   several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube            In December       The Times found more than     grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior  such as taking off clothes  adopting sexualised poses and touching other children inappropriately  by strangers       After a reporter flagged the videos in question  half of them were removed  and the rest were removed after The Times contacted YouTube s PR department       In February       YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a  wormhole  that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content  and make all of that user s recommended content feature only these types of videos  Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions  or otherwise making indecent remarks  In some cases  other users had reuploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos  and then monetized these  propagating this network       In the wake of the controversy  the service reported that they had deleted over     channels and tens of millions of comments  and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  A spokesperson explained that  any content including comments that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube  There s more to be done  and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly             Despite these measures  AT T  Disney  Dr  Oetker  Epic Games  and Nestl  all pulled their advertising from YouTube            Subsequently  YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments  The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem       YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children  and preemptively disable their comments sections   Trusted partners  can request that comments be re enabled  but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments  These actions mainly target videos of toddlers  but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual  such as gymnastics  YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators            A related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string  CP   an abbreviation of child pornography  resulted in a number of prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation  including videos related to the mobile video game Pok mon Go  which uses  CP  as an abbreviation of the statistic  Combat Power    and Club Penguin  YouTube apologized for the errors  and reinstated the affected videos       Separately  online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said  this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T Series rivalry in early       YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity       In June       The New York Times cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children       As a result  Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as  recommended  videos  excluding those that were  professionally produced   such as videos of televised talent shows       YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system  as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system        COPPA settlement See also  YouTube Kids In April       a coalition of    groups  including the CCFC  CDD  as well as Common Sense Media  filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission  alleging that YouTube collected information from users under the age of    without parental consent  in violation of the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act  COPPA        In September       YouTube was fined      million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of     in particular  viewing history  without parental consent  in order to allow channel operators to serve targeted advertising on their videos  In particular  the FTC ruled that YouTube was partly liable under COPPA  as the service s rating and curation of content as being suitable for children constituted the targeting of the website towards children       In order to comply with the settlement  YouTube was ordered to  develop  implement  and maintain a system for Channel Owners to designate whether their Content on the YouTube Service is directed to Children   YouTube also announced that it would invest      million over the next three years to support the creation of  thoughtful  original children s content             YouTube began to implement its compliance approach in November       in line with its settlement with the FTC  All channels must declare if their content is  made for kids   either as a blanket claim for their entire channel  or on a per video basis  The company states that a video is considered  made for kids  if its primary audience is children  or is  directed  to children based on various factors as guidelines  even if they are not the primary audience   including use of child actors   characters  celebrities  or toys that appeal to children   depictions of  activities that appeal to children  such as play acting  simple songs or games  or early education   and poems  songs  and stories intended for children  among others  YouTube will employ machine learning to find videos that they believe are clearly  made for kids  and automatically mark them as such  but will not help or advise content creators for videos that fall into unclear categories  as this constitutes legal advice                 In order to prevent data to be collected from minors without consent  videos marked as being  made for kids  were automatically reduced in functionality beginning on January          As a result  social and community features such as end screens and other widgets  notification functions  and comments are disabled  and videos can only be monetized with contextual advertising based on the video s metadata                      Further  liability for failing proper marking channels or videos as  made for kids  would fall onto the channel owners  with the FTC able to issue up to         fines per infringing video  though the FTC clarified that the amount would be based on  a company s financial condition and the impact a penalty could have on its ability to stay in business        The new policies have faced criticism  with some channel owners having considered YouTube and the FTC s guidance to be unclear in certain edge cases  such as video gaming  where content may typically be directed towards teens and young adults  but may still contain characters that appeal to children   They also noted that according to YouTube  a lack of targeted ads can reduce a video s revenue  and that the lack of social features may impact the ability for their videos to receive promotion            Videos marked as  made for kids  are also excluded from Google search engine results  further lowering revenue for content creators       Content creators who were unsure of whether their content was  made for kids  argued they would either need to preemptively mark their videos as such or make their videos private  or otherwise would be at risk of being fined by the FTC            The legal language of COPPA offered the ability for content to be marked for  mixed audience   which would allow for data collection from the viewers once the viewer had identified themselves of being    years or older  YouTube s decision not to include a  mixed audience  as a third option has been criticized  since this option would alleviate content creator concerns            YouTube had stated in their information page related to the COPPA requirements that  there are some complexities with the mixed audience category  which they have submitted to the FTC during public comment periods  and in the interim  decided to streamline the options for creators by creating a single  Made for kids  category to avoid further confusion in an already unclear space        FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter noted in dissenting remarks that many of the child directed channels on YouTube were run by owners outside of the U S   which may fall outside the jurisdiction of COPPA and the FTC s  practical reach        The FTC issued a blog post on November           to clarify what it considered  made for kids  and that several factors will be used to make this determination  and that it recognized that some types of content  like animated programming  can appeal to all ages and would not be immediately become subject to COPPA s requirements  The FTC also directed creators to its original complaint against YouTube  identifying channels and video content that they considered to be under COPPA that was the basis of their case       On December           citing the aforementioned criticism  YouTube filed comments with the FTC requesting clarity on its rules  citing the aforementioned edge cases       YouTube started treating all videos designated as  made for kids  as liable under COPPA on January                User comments See also  Criticism of Google   YouTube user comments Most videos enable users to leave comments  and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content  In       Time praised Web     for enabling  community and collaboration on a scale never seen before   and added that YouTube  harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom  Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone  never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred        The Guardian in      described users  comments on YouTube as        Juvenile  aggressive  misspelled  sexist  homophobic  swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL  YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance with the occasional burst of wit shining through  In September       The Daily Telegraph commented that YouTube was  notorious  for  some of the most confrontational and ill formed comment exchanges on the internet   and reported on YouTube Comment Snob   a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts        The Huffington Post noted in April      that finding comments on YouTube that appear  offensive  stupid and crass  to the  vast majority  of the people is hardly difficult       On November          Google implemented a comment system oriented on Google  that required all YouTube users to use a Google  account in order to comment on videos  The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments  thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone       The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments  which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse            In response  YouTube co founder Jawed Karim posted the question  why the fuck do I need a google  account to comment on a video   on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change       The official YouTube announcement      received         thumbs down  votes and generated more than        comments in two days       Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island  Chase Melvin noted that  Google  is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook  but it s essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don t want to lose their ability to comment on videos  and  Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system   In the same article Melvin goes on to say        Perhaps user complaints are justified  but the idea of revamping the old system isn t so bad  Think of the crude  misogynistic and racially charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation  Isn t any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot  The system is far from perfect  but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity  On July           Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google  account to post comments to YouTube       On November          YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve  hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments       Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam  They can also allow other users to moderate their comments       In May       it was noted that comments in videos and live streams containing the mandarin phrases        communist bandit   or           cent party   were automatically deleted within    seconds                      The censorship was considered odd as YouTube is blocked in China  In December      it was reported that YouTube is launching a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that  may be offensive to others              View counts In December       two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube  prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site s terms of service  which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts  This was disputed by Billboard  which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo  since the videos were no longer active on YouTube            On August          YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video s view count to freeze at        later         until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud       YouTube view counts once again updated in real time        Other algorithm design or implementation issues In       YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news  filling the infobox with content from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech       In the wake of the Notre Dame de Paris fire on April           several user uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube  system automatically with an Encyclopedia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September    attacks  Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection  YouTube officials apologized for this  stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically  and were taking steps to remedy this       Five leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ  materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August       alleging that YouTube s algorithms diverts discovery away from their channels  impacting their revenue  The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like  lesbian  or  gay   which would be predominant in their channels  content  and because of YouTube s near monopolization of online video services  they are abusing that position        Content moderation YouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators  who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube s content policies and determines if they should be removed  In September       a class action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  after an    month period on the job  The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube s stated limited of four hours per day of viewing graphic content  The lawsuit alleges that YouTube s contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderator s mental health  made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing  and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums  It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred  reduced in size or made monochrome  per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company                  Addy A Game and Street Attraction channels design In October       YouTube deactivated two channels run by  pick up artists  after a BBC investigation into the online industry  The company added   YouTube strictly prohibits explicit sexual  graphic or harassing content  Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of our community  and we will continue to review and refine our policies in this area         Censorship and bans Main article  Censorship of YouTube  Availability of YouTube as of January         Has local YouTube version   Accessible   Currently blocked   Previously blocked YouTube has been censored  filtered  or banned for a variety of reasons  including        Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest  Preventing criticism of a ruler  e g  in North Korea   government  e g  in China  or its actions  e g  in Morocco   government officials  e g  in Turkey and Libya   or religion  e g  in Pakistan   Morality based laws  e g  in Iran  Access to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws  e g  in Germany   violations of hate speech  and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth       which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with  restricted mode        Businesses  schools  government agencies  and other private institutions often block social media sites  including YouTube  due to its bandwidth limitations           and the site s potential for distraction            As of      update   public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries  including China  North Korea  Iran  Syria  Turkmenistan       Uzbekistan            Tajikistan  Eritrea  Sudan and South Sudan  In some countries  YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest  the run up to an election  or in response to upcoming political anniversaries  In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video  YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service       Reports emerged that since October       comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Communist Party of China     or  communist bandit   or     or     Cent Party   referring to state sponsored commentators  were being automatically deleted within    seconds       Specific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include   Thailand blocked access in April      over a video said to be insulting the Thai king       Morocco blocked access in May       possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco s occupation of Western Sahara       YouTube became accessible again on May           after Maroc Telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere  technical glitch        Turkey blocked access between      and      after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atat rk                 In November       a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly  and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video       During the two and a half year block of YouTube  the video sharing website remained the eighth most accessed site in Turkey            In       Turkey blocked the access for the second time  after  a high level intelligence leak                  Pakistan blocked access on February           because of  offensive material  towards the Islamic faith  including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad       This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours  as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries  On February           the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government            Many Pakistanis circumvented the three day block by using virtual private network software       In May       following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day  Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube  citing  growing sacrilegious content        The ban was lifted on May           after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government  However  individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked            Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September       after the site refused to remove the film Innocence of Muslims  with the ban still in operation as of September            The ban was lifted in January      after YouTube launched a Pakistan specific version       Libya blocked access on January           because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in       and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties  The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch       In November       after the Libyan Civil War  YouTube was once again allowed in Libya       Afghanistan  Bangladesh  Pakistan  and Sudan blocked access in September      following controversy over a    minute trailer for the film Innocence of Muslims which had been posted on the site                           A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled Innocence of Muslims should be banned       In Libya and Egypt  it was blamed by whom   for violent protests  YouTube stated that  This video which is widely available on the Web is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube  However  given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries             See also Listen to this article       megabytes   This audio
