beginning to worry him  The Bahrainis landed at Zubarah  which was abandoned since      and then moved to establish themselves at Fuwayrit  close to Al Huwaila  Despite being reinforced by a small number of Wahhabi horsemen and infantry  the chief of Al Huwaila sought mediation which was successful in keeping the status quo but required the desertion of Al Huwaila and the moving of its inhabitants to Bahrain  However  the Al Khalifas family induced some members of the Al Bukuwara tribe of Fuwayrit to attack Al Huwaila  killing a member of the Isa bin Tarif s family in the process  Moving to Abu Dhabi and intent on continuing his disagreement with Bahrain  Isa bin Tarif chief of Al Huwaila found himself constrained by the British  who refused to allow them to continue warfare

Tarif settled on the Persian island of Qais in      where he was considered to be no threat to the stability of the region     In the year       Shaikh Isa Bin Tarif was one of the men who assisted

deposed ruler of Bahrain  Abdullah bin Ahmed bin Khalifa  lived in Qatar during this period  After garnering support from the Wahhabis of Najd  he threatened to occupy Bahrain  Isa pledged allegiance to Abdullah and offered to assist him  This prompted Mohammed bin Khalifa to write a letter to Captain William Lowe  captain of the East India Company s naval squadron  in November  Captain Lowe responded to the letter by requesting Mohammed to refrain from hostilities at sea  and warned that any vessels found being used for war would be seized  Mohammed retorted by blaming Isa and Abdullah

Intent on defending the coast from Bahraini intervention  Isa and Mubarak bin Ahmed arrived in Fuwayrit with     troops in the first week of November  Mohammed retorted by sending   small ships and    battils and advancing towards Fuwayrit by way of Zubarah  As the tensions worsened  the British dispatched several naval ships to blockade Al Bida and wrote warning letters to Isa  Abdullah and Mohammed  Shortly after  Ali bin Khalifa landed on the coast of Al Khor with     Bahraini troops under his command  The Bahraini forces were accompanied by the governors of Al Hasa and Qatif  The forces of Isa and Mubarak bin Ahmed numbered     troops      The decisive battle took place on    November near Fuwayrit  Isa s forces were defeated after he and eighty of his men were killed  After proclaiming victory  Mohammed sent his warships to attack and demolish Al Bida  and relocated most of its inhabitants to Bahrain       References edit      R            Hennell  Political Resident in
