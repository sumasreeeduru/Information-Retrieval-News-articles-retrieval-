Britain  Ireland and the United Kingdom  Between the     s and     s  the Whigs contested power with their rivals  the Tories  By       the remnants of the Whig Party would merge with their old Tory rivals  to become the modern day Conservative Party  UK   The Whigs  origin lay in constitutional monarchism and opposition to absolute monarchy  supporting a parliamentary system  The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of      and were the standing enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders  who were Roman Catholic  The Whigs took full control of the government in      and remained totally dominant until King George III  coming to the throne in       allowed Tories back in  The Whig supremacy             was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in      and the failed Jacobite rising of      by Tory rebels  The Whigs thoroughly purged the Tories from all major positions in government  the army  the Church  the legal profession and local offices  The party s hold on power was so strong and durable that historians call the period from roughly      to      the age of the Whig oligarchy     The first great leader of the Whigs was Robert Walpole  who maintained control of the government             and whose prot g  Henry Pelham led              While the Whigs and Tories began as loose groupings or tendencies  both became quite formal by      with the ascension of Charles James Fox as the leader of a reconstituted Whig party  arrayed against the governing party of the new Tories under William Pitt the Younger  Both parties were founded on rich politicians more than on popular votes  Although there were elections to the House of Commons  only a few men controlled most of the voters  The Whig party slowly evolved during the   th century  Its tendency supported the aristocratic families  generally the continued disenfranchisement of Catholics and toleration of nonconformist Protestants  the dissenters such as the Presbyterians  while the Tories favoured the relative smallholders  whether narrowly  or minor gentry with High Tories preferring high church elements or even the exiled Stuarts  claim to the throne  Jacobitism  and virtually all maintained the legitimacy of a strongly established Church of England  Later  the Whigs drew support from the emerging industrial reformists and mercantile class while the Tories drew support from farmers  landowners  imperial military spending and relatedly royalists  By the first half of the   th century  the Whig programme came to encompass the supremacy of parliament  free trade and acceleration of the completion of Catholic equal rights  the abolition of slavery and expansion of the franchise  suffrage   The   th century Whig support for Catholic emancipation was a

term Whig was originally short for whiggamor  a term meaning  cattle driver  used to describe western Scots who came to Leith for corn  In the reign of Charles I the term was used during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms to refer derisively to a radical faction of the Scottish Covenanters who called themselves the Kirk Party  see the Whiggamore Raid   It was then applied to Scottish Presbyterian rebels who were against the King s Episcopalian order in Scotland          The term Whig entered English political discourse during the Exclusion Bill crisis of           when there was controversy about whether or not King Charles II s brother  James  should be allowed to succeed to the throne on Charles s death  Whig was a term of abuse applied to those who wanted to exclude James on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic  The fervent Tory Samuel Johnson often joked that  the first Whig was the Devil       In his six volume history of England  David Hume wrote   The court party reproached their antagonists with their affinity to the fanatical conventiclers in Scotland  who were known by the name of Whigs  The country party found  a resemblance between the courtiers and the popish banditti in Ireland  to whom the appellation of Tory was affixed  And after this manner  these foolish terms of reproach came into public and general use  and even at present seem not nearer their end than when they were first invented      Origins edit  Exclusion Crisis edit  Main articles  Exclusion Crisis and Green Ribbon Club  Anthony Ashley Cooper   st Earl of Shaftesbury  painted more than once during his chancellorship in      by John Greenhill Under Lord Shaftesbury s leadership  the Whigs in the Parliament of England wished to exclude the Duke of York  who later became King James II  from the throne due to his Roman Catholicism  his favouring of monarchical absolutism  and his connections to France  They believed the heir presumptive  if allowed to inherit the throne  would endanger the Protestant religion  liberty and property      The first Exclusion Bill was supported by a substantial majority on its second reading in May       In response  King Charles prorogued Parliament and then dissolved it  but the subsequent elections in August and September saw the Whigs  strength increase  This new parliament did not meet for thirteen months  because Charles wanted to give passions a chance to die down  When it met in October       an Exclusion Bill was introduced and passed in the Commons without major resistance  but was rejected in the Lords  Charles dissolved Parliament in January       but the Whigs did not suffer serious losses in the ensuing election  The next Parliament first met in March at Oxford  but Charles dissolved it after only a few days  when he made an appeal to the country against the Whigs and determined to rule without Parliament  In February  Charles had made a deal with the French King Louis XIV  who promised to support him against the Whigs  Without Parliament  the Whigs gradually crumbled  mainly due to government repression following the discovery of the Rye House Plot  The Whig peers  the Earl of Melville  the Earl of Leven  and Lord Shaftesbury  and Charles II s illegitimate son the Duke of Monmouth  being implicated  fled to and regrouped in the United Provinces  Algernon Sidney  Sir Thomas Armstrong and William Russell  Lord Russell  were executed for treason  The Earl of Essex committed suicide in the Tower of London over his arrest for treason  whilst Lord Grey of Werke escaped from the Tower       Glorious Revolution edit   Equestrian portrait of William III by Jan Wyck  commemorating the landing at Brixham  Torbay    November      After the Glorious Revolution of       Queen Mary II and King William III governed with both Whigs and Tories  despite the fact that many of the Tories still supported the deposed Roman Catholic James II      William saw that the Tories were generally friendlier to royal authority than the Whigs and he employed both groups in his government  His early ministry was largely Tory  but gradually the government came to be dominated by the so called Junto Whigs  a group of younger Whig politicians who led a tightly organised political grouping  The increasing dominance of the Junto led to a split among the Whigs  with the so called Country Whigs seeing the Junto as betraying their principles for office  The Country Whigs  led by Robert Harley  gradually merged with the Tory opposition in the later     s       History edit    th century edit  Although William s successor Anne had considerable Tory sympathies and excluded the Junto Whigs from power  after a brief and unsuccessful experiment with an exclusively Tory government she generally continued William s policy of balancing the parties  supported by her moderate Tory ministers  the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin  However  as the War of the Spanish Succession went on and became less and less popular with the Tories  Marlborough and Godolphin were forced to rely more and more on the Junto Whigs  so that by      they headed an administration of the Parliament of Great Britain dominated by the Junto  Anne herself grew increasingly uncomfortable with this dependence on the Whigs  especially as her personal relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough deteriorated  This situation also became increasingly uncomfortable to many of the non Junto Whigs  led by the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Shrewsbury  who began to intrigue with Robert Harley s Tories  In the spring of       Anne dismissed Godolphin and the Junto ministers  replacing them with Tories      The Whigs now moved into opposition and particularly decried the      Treaty of Utrecht  which they attempted to block through their majority in the House of Lords  The Tory administration led by Harley and the Viscount Bolingbroke persuaded the Queen to create twelve new Tory peers to force the treaty through       Liberal ideals edit  Main article  Whiggism The Whigs primarily advocated the supremacy of Parliament  while calling for toleration for Protestant dissenters  They adamantly opposed a Catholic as king      They opposed the Catholic Church because they saw it as a threat to liberty  or as the Pitt the Elder stated   The errors of Rome are rank idolatry  a subversion of all civil as well as religious liberty  and the utter disgrace of reason and of human nature       Ashcraft and Goldsmith        have traced in detail  in the period      to       the major influence of the liberal political ideas of John Locke on Whig political values  as expressed in widely cited manifestos such as  Political Aphorisms  or  the True Maxims of Government Displayed   an anonymous pamphlet that appeared in      and was widely cited by Whigs      The   th century Whigs borrowed the concepts and language of universal rights employed by political theorists Locke and Algernon Sidney                  By the     s the ideas of Adam Smith  a founder of classical liberalism became important  As Wilson and Reill        note   Adam Smith s theory melded nicely with the liberal political stance of the Whig Party and its middle class constituents       Samuel Johnson              a leading London intellectual  repeatedly denigrated the  vile      Whigs and praised the Tories  even during times of Whig political supremacy  In his great Dictionary         Johnson defined a Tory as  one who adheres to the ancient Constitution of the state and the apostolical hierarchy of the Church of England  opposed to a Whig   He linked   th century Whiggism with   th century revolutionary Puritanism  arguing that the Whigs of his day were similarly inimical to the established order of church and state  Johnson recommended that strict uniformity in religious externals was the best antidote to the objectionable religious traits that he linked to Whiggism       Protectionism edit  At their inception  the Whigs were protectionist in economic policy  with free trade policies being advocated by Tories      The Whigs were opposed to the pro French policies of the Stuart kings Charles II and James II as they believed that such an alliance with the Catholic absolute monarchy of France endangered liberty and Protestantism  The Whigs claimed that trade with France was bad for England and developed an economic theory of overbalance  that is a deficit of trade with France was bad because it would enrich France at England s expense      In       the Whigs passed the Prohibition of      that banned certain French goods from being imported into England  The economic historian William Ashley claimed that this Act witnessed the  real starting point in the history of Whig policy in the matter of trade       It was repealed upon the accession of James II by a Tory dominated House of Commons but upon the accession of William III in      a new Act was passed that prohibited the importation of French goods      In       the Whigs passed the Trade with France Act that renewed protectionism against France  In       Queen Anne appointed the predominantly Tory Harley Ministry  which favoured free trade  When the Tory minister Lord Bolingbroke proposed a commercial treaty with France in      that would have led to freer trade  the Whigs were vehemently against it and it had to be abandoned      In       Pitt s government negotiated the Eden Agreement  a commercial treaty with France which led to freer trade between the two countries  All of the Whig leaders attacked this on traditional Whig anti French and protectionist grounds  Fox claimed that France was England s natural enemy and that it was only at Britain s expense that she could grow  Edmund Burke  Richard Sheridan  William Windham and Charles Grey all spoke out against the trade agreement on the same grounds      Ashley claimed that   t he traditional policy of the Whig party from before the Revolution  of       down to the time of Fox was an extreme form of Protectionism       The Whigs  protectionism of this period is today increasingly cited with approval by heterodox economists such as Ha Joon Chang  who wish to challenge contemporary prevailing free trade orthodoxies via precedents from the past      Later on  they came to oppose the protectionism of the Corn Laws   Whig supremacy edit   John Somers   st Baron Somers With the succession of Elector George Louis of Hanover as king in       the Whigs returned to government with the support of some Hanoverian Tories  The Jacobite rising of      discredited much of the Tory party as treasonous Jacobites  and the Septennial Act ensured that the Whigs became the dominant party  establishing the Whig Oligarchy  Between      and      the Whig Split led to a division in the party  Government Whigs led by the former soldier James Stanhope were opposed by Robert Walpole and his allies  While Stanhope was backed by George I  Walpole and his supporters were closer to the Prince of Wales  Following his success in defeating the government over the Peerage Bill in       Walpole was invited back into government the following year  He was able to defend the government in the Commons when the South Sea Bubble collapsed  When Stanhope died unexpectedly in       Walpole replaced him as leader of the government and became known as the first Prime Minister  In the      general election the Whigs swept to a decisive victory  Between      and       the Tories struggled as an active political force  but always retained a considerable presence in the House of Commons  The governments of Walpole  Henry Pelham and his older brother the Duke of Newcastle dominated between      and       with a brief break during the also Whig Carteret ministry   The leading entities in these governments consistently referred to themselves as  Whigs        George III s accession edit  This arrangement changed during the reign of George III  who hoped to restore his own power by freeing himself from the great Whig magnates  Thus George promoted his old tutor Lord Bute to power and broke with the old Whig leadership surrounding the Duke of Newcastle  After a decade of factional chaos  with distinct Bedfordite  Chathamite  Grenvillite and Rockinghamite and  factions successively in power and all referring to themselves as  Whigs   a new system emerged with two separate opposition groups  The Rockingham Whigs claimed the mantle of Old Whigs as the purported successors of the party of the Pelhams and the great Whig families  With such noted intellectuals as Edmund Burke behind them  the Rockingham Whigs laid out a philosophy which for the first time extolled the virtues of faction  or at least their faction  The other group were the followers of Lord Chatham  who as the great political hero of the Seven Years  War generally took a stance of opposition to party and faction      The Whigs were opposed by the government of Lord North which they accused of being a Tory administration  While it largely consisted of individuals previously associated with the Whigs  many old Pelhamites as well as the Bedfordite Whig faction formerly led by the Duke of Bedford and elements of that which had been led by George Grenville  it also contained elements of the Kings  Men  the group formerly associated with Lord Bute and which was generally seen as Tory leaning       American impact edit  The association of Toryism with Lord North s government was also influential in the American colonies and writings of British political commentators known as the Radical Whigs did much to stimulate colonial republican sentiment  Early activists in the colonies called themselves Whigs  example  needed  seeing themselves as in alliance with the political opposition in Britain  until they turned to independence and started emphasising the label Patriots  In contrast  the American Loyalists  who supported the monarchy  were consistently also referred to as Tories  Later  the United States Whig Party was founded in      and focused on opposition to a strong presidency just as the British Whigs had opposed a strong monarchy      The True Whig Party  which for a century dominated Liberia  was named for the American party rather than directly for the British one   Two party system edit   In A Block for the Wigs         caricaturist James Gillray caricatured Charles James Fox s return to power in a coalition with Frederick North  Lord North  George III is the blockhead in the centre  Dickinson reports the following   All historians are agreed that the Tory party declined sharply in the late     s and     s and that it ceased to be an organized party by       The research of Sir Lewis Namier and his disciples       has convinced all historians that there were no organized political parties in Parliament between the late     s and the early     s  Even the Whigs ceased to be an identifiable party  and Parliament was dominated by competing political connections  which all proclaimed Whiggish political views  or by independent backbenchers unattached to any particular group      The North administration left power in March      following the American Revolution and a coalition of the Rockingham Whigs and the former Chathamites  now led by the Earl of Shelburne  took its place  After Rockingham s unexpected death in July       this uneasy coalition fell apart  with Charles James Fox  Rockingham s successor as faction leader  quarrelling with Shelburne and withdrawing his supporters from the government  The following Shelburne administration was short lived and Fox returned to power in April       this time in an unexpected coalition with his old enemy Lord North  Although this pairing seemed unnatural to many at the time  it was to last beyond the demise of the coalition in December       The coalition s untimely fall was brought about by George III in league with the House of Lords and the King now brought in Chatham s son William Pitt the Younger as his prime minister  It was only now that a genuine two party system can be seen to emerge  with Pitt and the government on the one side  and the ousted Fox North coalition on the other  On    December       Fox stated in the House of Commons that   i f       a change must take place  and a new ministry is to be formed and supported  not by the confidence of this House or the public  but the sole authority of the Crown  I  for one  shall not envy that hon  gentleman his situation  From that moment I put in my claim for a monopoly of Whig principles       Although Pitt is often referred to as a Tory and Fox as a Whig  Pitt always considered himself to be an independent Whig and generally opposed the development of a strict partisan political system  Fox s supporters saw themselves as legitimate heirs of the Whig tradition and they strongly opposed Pitt in his early years in office  notably during the regency crisis revolving around the King s temporary insanity in            when Fox and his allies supported full powers as regent for their ally  the Prince of Wales  The opposition Whigs were split by the onset of the French Revolution  While Fox and some younger members of the party such as Charles Grey and Richard Brinsley Sheridan were sympathetic to the French revolutionaries  others led by Edmund Burke were strongly opposed  Although Burke himself was largely alone in defecting to Pitt in       much of the rest of the party  including the influential House of Lords leader the Duke of Portland  Rockingham s nephew Lord Fitzwilliam and William Windham  were increasingly uncomfortable with the flirtations of Fox and his allies with radicalism and the French Revolution  They split in early      with Fox over the question of support for the war with France and by the end of the year they had openly broken with Fox  By the summer of the next year  large portions of the opposition had defected and joined Pitt s government     th century edit  Many of the Whigs who had joined with Pitt would eventually return to the fold  joining again with Fox in the Ministry of All the Talents following Pitt s death in       The followers of Pitt led until      by Fox s old colleague the Duke of Portland rejected the label of Tories and preferred to call themselves The Friends of Mr  Pitt  After the fall of the Talents ministry in       the Foxite Whigs remained out of power for the better part of    years  The accession of Fox s old ally  the Prince of Wales  to the regency in      did not change the situation  as the Prince had broken entirely with his old Foxite Whig companions  The members of the government of Lord Liverpool from      to      called themselves Whigs       Structure and appeal edit  By       the Whigs were still far from being a  party  in the modern sense  They had no definite programme or policy and were by no means even united  Generally  they stood for reducing crown patronage  sympathy towards nonconformists  support for the interests of merchants and bankers and a leaning towards the idea of a limited reform of the voting system  citation needed  Most Whig leaders  such as Lord Grey  Lord Grenville  Lord Althorp  William Lamb  later Lord Melbourne  and Lord John Russell  were still rich landowners  The most prominent exception was Henry Brougham  the talented lawyer  who had a relatively modest background      Hay argues that Whig leaders welcomed the increasing political participation of the English middle classes in the two decades after the defeat of Napoleon in       The fresh support strengthened their position in Parliament  Whigs rejected the Tory appeals to governmental authority and social discipline and extended political discussion beyond Parliament  Whigs used a national network of newspapers and magazines as well as local clubs to deliver their message  The press organised petitions and debates and reported to the public on government policy  while leaders such as Henry Brougham             built alliances with men who lacked direct representation  This new approach to the grass roots helped to define Whiggism and opened the way for later success  Whigs thereby forced the government to recognise the role of public opinion in parliamentary debate and influenced views of representation and reform throughout the   th century       Return to power edit  Whigs restored their unity by supporting moral reforms  especially the abolition of slavery  They triumphed in      as champions of Parliamentary reform  They made Lord Grey prime minister           and the Reform Act      championed by Grey became their signature measure  It broadened the franchise and ended the system of  rotten boroughs  and  pocket boroughs   where elections were controlled by powerful families  and instead redistributed power on the basis of population  It added         voters to an electorate of         in England and Wales  Only the upper and middle classes voted  so this shifted power away from the landed aristocracy to the urban middle classes  In       the party abolished enslavement in the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act       It purchased and freed the slaves  especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands  After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour  limited reforms were passed in       The Whigs also passed the Poor Law Amendment Act      that reformed the administration of relief to the poor      It was around this time that the great Whig historian Thomas Babington Macaulay began to promulgate what would later be coined the Whig view of history  in which all of English history was seen as leading up to the culminating moment of the passage of Lord Grey s reform bill  This view led to serious distortions in later portrayals of   th century and   th century history  as Macaulay and his followers attempted to fit the complex and changing factional politics of the Restoration into the neat categories of   th century political divisions  In       a private gentleman s Club was constructed in Pall Mall  Piccadilly as a consequence of the successful Reform Act       The Reform Club was founded by Edward Ellice Sr   MP for Coventry and Whig Whip  whose riches came from the Hudson s Bay Company but whose zeal was chiefly devoted to securing the passage of the Reform Act       This new club  for members of both Houses of Parliament  was intended to be a forum for the radical ideas which the First Reform Bill represented  a bastion of liberal and progressive thought that became closely associated with the Liberal Party  who largely succeeded the Whigs in the second half of the   th century  Until the decline of the Liberal Party in the early   th century  it was de rigueur for Liberal MPs and peers to be members of the Reform Club  being regarded as an unofficial party headquarters  However  in      the National Liberal Club was established under William Ewart Gladstone s chairmanship  designed to be more  inclusive  towards Liberal grandees and activists throughout the United Kingdom   Transition to the Liberal Party edit  The Liberal Party  the term was first used officially in       but had been used colloquially for decades beforehand  arose from a coalition of Whigs  free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel and free trade Radicals  first created  tenuously under the Peelite Earl of Aberdeen in      and put together more permanently under the former Canningite Tory Lord Palmerston in       Although the Whigs at first formed the most important part of the coalition  the Whiggish elements of the new party progressively lost influence during the long leadership of the former Peelite William Ewart Gladstone and many of the old Whig aristocrats broke from the party over the issue of Irish home rule in      to help form the Liberal Unionist Party  which in turn would merge with the Conservative Party by           However  the Unionist support for trade protection in the early twentieth century under Joseph Chamberlain  probably the least Whiggish character in the Liberal Unionist party  further alienated the more orthodox Whigs  By the early twentieth century  Whiggery  was largely irrelevant and without a natural political home  One of the last active politicians to celebrate his Whiggish roots was the Liberal Unionist statesman Henry James       In popular culture edit   The British Whig March  for piano was written by Oscar Telgmann in Kingston
