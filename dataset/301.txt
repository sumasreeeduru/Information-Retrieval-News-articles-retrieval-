   the area is split into     Palestinian  islands  under partial Palestinian National Authority civil rule  and     Israeli settlements into which Israeli law is  pipelined   The  West Bank  name was given to the territory after it was captured by Jordan in the      Arab Israeli War because it sits on the west side of the Jordan river  Jordan subsequently annexed the territory in      and held it until      when it was  occupied by Israel during the      Six Day War  The Oslo Accords  signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel  created administrative districts with varying levels of Palestinian autonomy within each area  Area C  in which Israel maintained complete civil and security control  accounts for over     of the territory of the West Bank     The West Bank

administration by Jordan  which subsequently annexed it in       This annexation was considered illegal and was recognized only by Britain  Iraq and Pakistan      The term was chosen to differentiate the west bank of the River Jordan from the  east bank  of this river   Cisjordan The neo Latin name Cisjordan or Cis Jordan  literally  on this side of the River Jordan   is the usual name for the territory in the Romance languages and Hungarian  The name West Bank  however  has become the standard usage for this geopolitical entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages since its creation following the Jordanian army s conquest  In English  the name Cisjordan is occasionally used to designate the entire region between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean  particularly in the historical context of the British Mandate and earlier times  citation needed  The analogous Transjordan  literally  on the other side of the River Jordan   has historically been used to designate the region now roughly comprising the state of Jordan  which lies to the east of the Jordan River   History See also  History of the ancient Levant  History of Palestine  Samaria   History  and Judea

the League of Nations were the basic documents upon which the British Mandate for Palestine was constructed  The British proclaimed Abdullah emir of Transjordan on    April       He declared it an independent Hashemite kingdom on    May       In       it was subsequently designated as part of a proposed Arab state by the United Nations  UN  partition plan for Palestine  The resolution recommended partition of the British Mandate into a Jewish State  an Arab State  and an internationally administered enclave of Jerusalem      a broader region of the modern day West Bank was assigned to the Arab State  The resolution designated the territory described as  the hill country of Samaria and Judea       the area now known as the  West Bank   as part of the proposed Arab state  but

Following the December      Jericho Conference  Transjordan annexed the area west of the Jordan River in       naming it  West Bank  or  Cisjordan   and designated the area east of the river as  East Bank  or  Transjordan   Jordan  as it was now known  ruled over the West Bank from      until       Jordan s annexation was never formally recognized by the international community  with the exception of the United Kingdom and Iraq              A two state option  dividing Palestine  as opposed to a binary solution arose during the period of the British mandate in the area  The United Nations Partition Plan had envisaged two states  one Jewish and the other Arab Palestinian  but in the wake of the war only one emerged at the time       During the      war  Israel occupied parts of what was designated in the UN partition plan as  Palestine   King Abdullah of Jordan had been crowned King of Jerusalem by the Coptic Bishop on    November           Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were granted Jordanian citizenship and half of the Jordanian Parliament seats          Many refugees continued to live in camps and relied on UNRWA assistance for sustenance  Palestinian refugees constituted more than a third of the kingdom s population of     million  The last Jordanian elections in which West Bank residents would vote were those of April       but their parliamentary representatives would continue in office until       when West Bank seats were finally abolished  Palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state without discrimination      Agriculture remained the primary activity of the territory  The West Bank  despite its smaller area  contained half of Jordan s agricultural land  In           of the labor force of        worked in agriculture  and       km  were under cultivation  In              workers were employed in industry  producing    of the GNP  This number fell after the      war  and would not be

occupation the West Bank accounted for     of Jordanian GNP  between     and     of its agricultural output and almost half of its manpower  though only a third of Jordanian investment was allocated to it and mainly to the private housing construction sector      Though its per capita product was    times greater than that of the West Bank  the Israeli economy on the eve of occupation had experienced two years             of a sharp recession  Immediately after the occupation  from      to       the economy boomed  In      the Palestinian economy had a gross domestic product of        per capita for a million people      with the West Bank population at          a  of whom     were refugees  and was growing annually by     West Bank growth  compared to Gaza       had lagged  due to the effect of mass emigration of West Bankers seeking employment in Jordan      As agriculture gave way to industrial development in Israel  in the West Bank the former still generated     of domestic

Civil Administration In June       the West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured by Israel as a result of the Six Day War  With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli Jordanian no man s land  the West Bank was not annexed by Israel  it remained under Israeli military control until       Although the      Arab League summit resolution at Rabat designated the Palestinian Liberation Organization  PLO  as the  sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people   Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until           when it severed all administrative and legal ties with the West Bank and eventually stripped West Bank Palestinians of Jordanian citizenship      In       as a result of the Israeli Egyptian peace treaty  the direct military rule was transformed into a semi civil authority  operating directly under the Israeli Ministry of Defense  thus taking control of civil matters of Palestinians from the IDF to civil servants in the Ministry of Defense  The Israeli settlements were  on the other hand  administered subsequently as Judea and Samaria Area directly by Israel  Since the      Oslo Accords  the Palestinian Authority officially controls a geographically non contiguous territory comprising approximately     of the West Bank  known as Area A  which remains subject to Israeli incursions  Area B  approximately      is subject to joint Israeli Palestinian military and Palestinian civil control  Area C  approximately      is under full Israeli control  Though     nations refer to the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  as  Occupied Palestinian Territory           the state of Israel quotes the UN that only territories captured in war from  an established and recognized sovereign  are considered occupied territories      After the      split between Fatah and Hamas  the West Bank areas under Palestinian control are an exclusive part of the Palestinian Authority  while the Gaza Strip is ruled by Hamas   Early economic impact The Jordanians neglected to invest much in the area during their time governing the area  although there was some investment in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem  Soon after the      war  Yigal Allon produced the Allon Plan  which would have annexed a strip along the Jordan River valley and excluded areas closer to the pre      border  which had a high density of Palestinians  Moshe Dayan proposed a plan which Gershom Gorenberg likens to a  photo negative of Allon s   b  The Allon plan evolved over a period of time to include more territory  The final draft dating from      would have annexed about half of the West Bank      Israel had no overall approach for integrating the West Bank  c  The early occupation set severe limits on public investment and comprehensive development programmes in the territories  British and Arab commercial banks operating in the West Bank were closed down soon after Israel assumed power there  Bank Leumi then opened nine branches  without successfully replacing the earlier system  Farmers could get loans  but Palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them since they charged    compared to    interest in Jordan          By June       only a third of West Bank land had been registered under Jordan s Settlement of Disputes over Land and Water Law and in      Israel moved to cancel the possibility of registering one s title with the Jordanian Land Register      Ian Lustick states that Israel  virtually prevented  Palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture      At the same time  Israel encouraged Arab labour to enter into Israel s economy  and regarded them as a new  expanded and protected market for Israeli exports  Limited export of Palestinian goods to Israel was allowed      Expropriation of prime agricultural land in an economy where two thirds of the workforce had farmed is believed to account for the flight of labourers to work in Israel      As much as     of the workforce commuted to Israel on a daily basis finding only poorly paid menial employment      Remittances from labourers earning a wage in Israel were the major factor in Palestinian economic growth during the         boom years      but the migration of workers from the territories had a negative impact on local industry by creating an internal labour scarcity in the West Bank and consequent pressure for higher wages there      the contrast between the quality of their lives and Israelis  growing prosperity stoked resentment      Attempting to impose governmental authority  Israel established a licensing system according to which no industrial plant could be built without obtaining a prior Israeli permit  With Military Order No          June        the local commander was given the power and authority to block any construction if  in his evaluation  the building might pose a danger to Israel s security  The overall effect was to obstruct manufacturing development and subordinate any local industrial activity to the exigencies of Israel s economy  or to block the creation of industries that might compete with Israel s  For example  entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in Hebron  In order to protect Israeli farmers  melon production was forbidden  imports of grapes and dates were banned  and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced      Israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the Ministry for Industry and Trade to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in Ramallah      The sum effect after two decades was that     of all Palestinian firms in the West Bank  and Gaza  employing over eight people  and     with seven or less  were prohibited from selling their products in Israel      Israeli protectionist policies thus distorted wider trade relations to the point that  by           of all West Bank imports came from Israel  with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise

renounced its territorial claims in       signing the Treaty of Lausanne  and the area now called the West Bank became an integral part of the British Mandate for Palestine  During the Mandate period Britain had no right of sovereignty  which was held by the people under the mandate      Nevertheless  Britain  as custodians of the land  implemented the land tenure laws in Palestine  which it had inherited from the Ottoman Turks  as defined in the Ottoman Land Code of        applying these laws to both Arab and Jewish legal tenants or otherwise      In      the UN General Assembly recommended that the area that became the West Bank become part of a future Arab state  but this proposal was opposed by the Arab states at the time  In       Jordan occupied the West Bank and annexed it in           In       Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the Six Day War  UN Security Council Resolution     followed  calling for withdrawal  return to the      armistice lines  from territories occupied in the conflict in exchange for peace and mutual recognition   Since       the United Nations Security Council      the United Nations General Assembly      the United States      the EU      the International Court of Justice      and the International Committee of the Red Cross     refer to the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  as occupied Palestinian territory or the occupied territories  General Assembly resolution            May       affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over the area      The International Court of Justice and the Supreme Court of Israel have ruled that the status of the West Bank is that of military occupation     In its      advisory opinion the International Court of Justice concluded that   The territories situated between the Green Line and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in      during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan  Under customary international law  the Court observes  these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power  Subsequent events in these territories have done nothing to alter this situation  The Court concludes that all these territories  including East Jerusalem  remain occupied territories and that Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power         In the same vein the Israeli Supreme Court stated in the      Beit Sourik case that   The general point of departure of all parties   which is also our point of departure   is that Israel holds the area in belligerent occupation  occupatio bellica       The authority of the military commander flows from the provisions of public international law regarding belligerent occupation  These rules are established principally in the Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land  The Hague     October       hereinafter   the Hague Regulations   These regulations reflect customary international law  The military commander s authority is also anchored in IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War              The executive branch of the Israeli government  through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  has defined the West Bank as  disputed  instead of  occupied  territory  whose status can only be determined through negotiations  The Ministry says that occupied territories are territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign  and that since the West Bank wasn t under the legitimate and recognized sovereignty of any state prior to the Six Day War  it shouldn t be considered an occupied territory      The International Court of Justice ruling of   July       however  found that the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  is territory held by Israel under military occupation  regardless of its status prior to it coming under Israeli occupation  and that the Fourth Geneva convention applies de jure       The international community regards the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  as territories occupied by Israel      International law  Article    of the Fourth Geneva Convention  prohibits  transfers of the population of an occupying power to occupied territories   incurring a responsibility on the part of Israel s government to not settle Israeli citizens in the West Bank      As of February                   of the     member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine     within the Palestinian territories  which are recognized by Israel to constitute a single

independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with Israel  see also proposals for a Palestinian state   However  the  Road Map  states that in the first phase  Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel  whereas Israel must dismantle all outposts  The Palestinian Authority believes that the West Bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation  and that the presence of Israeli military control is a violation of their right to Palestinian Authority rule  The United Nations calls the West Bank and Gaza Strip Israeli occupied territories  The United States State Department also refers to the territories as occupied              In      the United States ambassador to Israel  Daniel C  Kurtzer  expressed U S  support  for the retention by Israel of major Israeli population centres  in the West Bank  as an outcome of negotiations       reflecting President Bush s statement a year earlier that a permanent peace treaty would have to reflect  demographic realities  on the West Bank      In May      US President Barack Obama officially stated US support for a future Palestinian state based on borders prior to the      War  allowing for land swaps where they are mutually agreeable between the two sides  Obama was the first US president to formally support the policy  but he stated that it had been one long held by the US in its Middle East

Jerusalem Law  the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution      declaring that the law was  null and void   Although permanent residents are permitted  if they wish  to receive Israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the State and renouncing any other citizenship  most Palestinians did not apply for Israeli citizenship for political reasons      There are various possible reasons as to why the West Bank had not been annexed     to Israel after its capture in       The government of Israel has not formally confirmed an official reason  however  historians and analysts have established a variety of such  most of them demographic  Among those most commonly cited have been   Reluctance to award its citizenship to an overwhelming number of a potentially hostile population whose allies were sworn to the destruction of Israel          To ultimately exchange land for peace with neighbouring states         Fear that the population of ethnic Arabs  including Israeli citizens of Palestinian ethnicity  would outnumber the Jewish Israelis west of the Jordan River          The disputed legality of annexation under the Fourth Geneva Convention     The importance of demographic concerns to some significant figures in Israel s leadership was illustrated when Avraham Burg  a former Knesset Speaker and former chair of the Jewish Agency for Israel  wrote in The Guardian in September         Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there is no longer a clear Jewish majority  And so  fellow citizens  it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price  We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East  There cannot be democracy without equal rights for all who live here  Arab as well as Jew  We cannot keep the territories and preserve a Jewish majority in the world s only Jewish state   not by means that are humane and moral and Jewish       Israeli settlements Main article  International law and Israeli settlements  Map of Israeli settlements and Area C  magenta and blue        As of       more than         Israelis live in over     settlements in the West Bank  Of those          live in settlements in East Jerusalem and         live in other parts of the West Bank      of those settlements are officially recognized by the Israeli government  A further     settlements are not officially recognized and are illegal under Israeli law  but have nevertheless been provided with infrastructure  water  sewage  and other services by the authorities  They are colloquially known as  illegal outposts        As a result of  Enclave law   large portions of Israeli civil law are applied to Israeli settlements and Israeli residents in the occupied territories       The international consensus is that all Israeli settlements on the West Bank beyond the Green Line are illegal under international law                      In particular  the European Union as a whole      considers the settlements to be illegal  Significant portions of the Israeli public similarly oppose the continuing presence of Jewish Israelis in the West Bank and have supported the      settlement relocation       The majority of legal scholars also hold the settlements to violate international law     however individuals including Julius Stone            and Eugene Rostow      have argued that they are legal under international law       Immediately after the      war Theodor Meron  legal counsel of Israel s Foreign Ministry advised Israeli ministers in a  top secret  memo that any policy of building settlements across occupied territories violated international law and would  contravene the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention                  The UN Security Council has issued several non binding resolutions addressing the issue of the settlements  Typical of these is UN Security Council resolution     which states  the  practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since      have no legal validity  and it calls on Israel as the occupying Power  to abide scrupulously by the      Fourth Geneva Convention       The Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention held in Geneva on   December      called upon  the Occupying Power to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  including East Jerusalem  and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention   The High Contracting Parties reaffirmed  the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof        On    December       Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert issued an order requiring approval by both the Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli Defense Minister of all settlement activities  including planning  in the West Bank       The change had little effect with settlements continuing to expand  and new ones being established  On    August       Israel announced it was appropriating     hectares of land in the West Bank to eventually house       Israel families  The appropriation was described as the largest in more than    years       According to reports on Israel Radio  the development is a response to the      kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers        Palestinian outposts  A Palestinian demonstration against the demolition of the village Susya The Haaretz published an article in December      about demolition of  Palestinian outposts  in Bil in       the demolitions sparked a political debate as according to PeaceNow it was a double standard   After what happened today in Bil in  there is no reason that the state should defend its decision to continue the construction  credited to Michael Sfard   In January       the European Union approved the  Area C and Palestinian state building  report  The report said Palestinian presence in Area C has been continuously undermined by Israel and that state building efforts in Area C of the Palestinian Authority  PA  and the EU were of  utmost importance in order to support the creation of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state   The EU will support various projects to  support the Palestinian people and help maintain their presence             In May       a petition      was filed to the Israeli Supreme Court about the legality of more         Palestinian outposts and Palestinian building in  Area C   The cases were filed by Regavim            The petition was one of    different petitions with the common ground of illegal land takeover and illegal construction and use of natural resources  Some of the petitions      had been set for trials      and the majority received a verdict  Ynet News stated on    January      that a group of     Palestinians with unknown number of foreign activists created an outpost named Bab al Shams   Gate of the Sun    contains    tents      Ynet News stated on    January      that Palestinian activists built an outpost on a disputed area in Beit Iksa  where Israel plans to construct part of the separation fence in the Jerusalem vicinity while the Palestinians claim that the area belongs to the residents of Beit Iksa  named Bab al Krama       West Bank barrier Main article  Israeli West Bank barrier  West Bank barrier  Separating Wall   Qalandiya Checkpoint between Ramallah and Jerusalem The Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier ordered for construction by the Israeli Government  consisting of a network of fences with vehicle barrier trenches surrounded by an on average    meters      ft  wide exclusion area       and up to   meters     ft  high concrete walls        although in most areas the wall is not nearly that high        It is located mainly within the West Bank  partly along the      Armistice line  or  Green Line  between the West Bank and Israel  As of April      the length of the barrier as approved by the Israeli government is     kilometers      mi  long  needs update  Approximately       has been constructed        is under construction  and construction has not yet begun on     of the barrier       The space between the barrier and the green line is a closed military zone known as the Seam Zone  cutting off      of the West Bank and encompassing dozens of villages and tens of thousands of Palestinians                 The barrier generally runs along or near the      Jordanian Israeli armistice Green Line  but diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of Jewish settlements in the West Bank such as East Jerusalem  Ariel  Gush Etzion  Immanuel  Karnei Shomron  Givat Ze ev  Oranit  and Maale Adumim  Supporters of the barrier claim it is necessary for protecting Israeli civilians from Palestinian attacks  which increased significantly during the Al Aqsa Intifada            it has helped reduce incidents of terrorism by     from      to       over a     reduction in terror attacks in the six years ending in            though Israel s State Comptroller has acknowledged that most of the suicide bombers crossed into Israel through existing checkpoints       Its supporters claim that the onus is now on the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorism       Opponents claim the barrier is an illegal attempt to annex Palestinian land under the guise of security       violates international law       has the intent or effect to pre empt final status negotiations       and severely restricts Palestinian livelihoods  particularly limiting their freedom of movement within and from the West Bank thereby undermining their economy        Administrative divisions Main article

the military order       entitled  An order concerning transition station   Later  Order       was issued which annexed the Damia Bridge crossing point to the Allenby Bridge as a commercial crossing point only  Goods were exported to Jordan  while the import was banned for security purposes       In       the Palestinian National Authority  according to Oslo Accord assigned by PLO and the Israeli government  became a partial supervisor over the Rafah Border Crossing to Gaza Strip  The Palestinian Authority was responsible for issuing passports to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip  However  Israel remained the major responsible party for this crossing point  According to the agreement  Israel has the right to independently inspect luggage and to maintain security  In addition  it can prevent anyone from using the crossing             Economy Main article  Economy of the Palestinian territories As of the early   st century  the economy of the Palestinian territories is chronically depressed  with unemployment rates constantly over     since           in the West Bank in first half of              Consequences of occupation Economic consequences According to a      World Bank report  Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank       A      World Bank report calculates that  if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted  a few key industries alone would produce US     billion per annum more  or     of      Palestinian GDP  and reduce by some US     million       the Palestinian Authority s deficit  the employment would increase by            Water supply Main article  Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories Amnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources   Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories  OPT  do not have access to adequate  safe water supplies   Discriminatory Israeli policies in the OPT are the root cause of the striking disparity in access to water between Palestinians and Israelis   The inequality is even more pronounced between Palestinian communities and unlawful Israeli settlements  established in the OPT in violation of international law  Swimming pools  well watered lawns and large irrigated farms in Israeli settlements in the OPT stand in stark contrast next to Palestinian villages whose inhabitants struggle even to meet their essential domestic water needs  In parts of the West Bank  Israeli settlers use up to    times more water per capita than neighbouring Palestinian communities  who survive on barely    litres of water per capita a day  the minimum amount recommended by the WHO for emergency situations response       Israeli settlers in the West Bank have seized dozens of wells from Palestinians  The wells are privately owned by Palestinians and the settlers forcible took them  gave them Hebrew names and  with the assistance of the Israeli military  prevent Arab people  including the wells  owners  from using the wells and the pools the wells feed        Israeli garbage disposal Israel ratified the international Basel Convention treaty on Israel on    December       according to which  any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people  It forbids the creation among them of  environmental sacrifice zones        Israel  it is argued  uses the West Bank as a  sacrifice  zone for placing    waste treatment plants  which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment  The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations  These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge  infectious medical waste  used oils  solvents  metals  electronic waste and batteries       In      it was estimated that         mcm a year  of all wastewater flowing into the West Bank derived from settlements and Jerusalem       Of the     settlements surveyed     had wastewater treatrment plant  much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown  with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where Palestinian villages are located  Only   of    indictments for waste pollution were made over the years from      to       whereas in Israel the laws are strictly applied and  in      alone      enforcements for the same abuse were enforced       At the same time        of Palestinian wastewater was not treated  with only   of   Israeli plants built in the     s to that purpose functioning  and the neglect to improve the infrastructure is attributed to Israeli budgetary problems       After the Oslo Accords  the global community earmarked              for West Bank wastewater infrastructure  Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements  which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted  Most of the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations       The PA did raise funds from Germany for    plants  but only managed to build one  at al Bireh  within Area B  though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of Psagot  though refusing to pay fees for the treatment       Palestinian towns like Salfit have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of Ariel            Unlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel  the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on    million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank  It claims     is treated adequately but independent Israeli studies        suggest that only    met Israeli treatment standards  while     was either not treated adequastely or discharged raw  Since then some improvements have been implemented       The landfill near Al Jiftlik in the Jericho Governorate  built on absentee Palestinian property without planning or an environment impact analysis  is for the exclusive use of waste        tons per day  produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel       Palestinians are restricted to   landfills  and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage  Even if a permit is given without this agreement  settler waste under military escort is still dumped there       Israel has been accused of engaging in  warfare ecology  in the West Bank       In response to local opposition in Israel to waste treatment plants and the high cost of meeting stringent environment laws in that country  It has been argued that Israel had used the area of the West Bank as a  sacrifice zone  where its waste can be dumped     d  Many waste treatment facilities in the West Bank were built for processing waste generated inside Israeli sovereign territory  according to B Tselem  Israel s leading human rights organization for monitoring the West Bank                  At least    waste treatment plants operate in the West Bank and most of the waste they process is brought over from within the Green line inside Israel proper  citation needed  Of these    facilities  six process hazardous waste  including infectious medical waste  used oils and solvents  metals  batteries and electronic industry byproducts  and one facility that processes sewage sludge  citation needed  The Israel government requires no reporting by these West Bank facilities of the amount of waste they process or the risks they pose to the local population  and applies less rigorous regulatory standards to these facilities than it does to solid waste treatment facilities in Israel  citation needed  B Tselem  Israel s leading independent human rights organization for monitoring human rights in the West Bank  has observed that  any transfer of waste to the West Bank is a breach of international law which Israel is dutybound to uphold  because according to international law  an occupied territory or its resources may not be used for the benefit of the occupying power s own needs                              Experts have also warned that some of these facilities are garbage dumps that endanger the purity of the mountain aquifer  which is one of the largest sources of water in the region        Palestinian garbage and sewage Main article  Water supply and sanitation in the State of Palestine In       the Palestinian Water Authority  PWA  was established by a presidential decree  One year later  its functions  objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by law  giving the PWA the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy       About     of the Palestinians in the Territories had access to improved sanitation in            Cesspits were used by     of households  while access to the sewer network increased to     in       up from     in            In the West Bank  only        out of        m  of wastewater were treated in five municipal wastewater treatment plants in Hebron  Jenin  Ramallah  Tulkarem and Al Bireh       The Al Bireh plant was constructed in      with funding by the German aid agency KfW       According to the World Bank report  the other four plants perform poorly concerning efficiency and quality        Resource extraction Based on the number of quarries per km  in Areas A and B  it is calculated that  were Israel to lift restrictions  a further     quarries could be opened in Area C   The World Bank estimates that Israel s virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US     million per year       In International law drawing on the Hague Conventions  Article      it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets  and that the usufruct must benefit the people under occupation  The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority  Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell     of their material to Israel  which arguably constitutes  depletion  and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities       Thus the German cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba paid out                     in taxes to the Samaria Regional Council in      alone       The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after   decades Israeli law must adapt to  the realities on the ground   The state did undertake not to open more quarries       As an illustrative example  a Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian owned quarry company in Beit Fajar and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land  The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone  whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly    Beit Fajar quarries  or nearly any other Palestinian owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration       Israel had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank       The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm Ahava  established in       were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of Mitzpe Shalem and Kalya      of their production is sold in the EU market       In      The UN  stating that the violations were both  pervasive and devastating  to the local Palestinian population  identified some     companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank       Roughly    percent of global bromine production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea  The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of potash  bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US     million per annum  or   percent of GDP            The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash  and for making bromide based flame retardants  based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan  suggest a figure of      million        Loss of cultural property Albert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony  by confiscating Arab cultural resources  In      it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum e  and its library in East Jerusalem  f  Often these losses are personal  as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables  The journalist Hamdi Faraj  jailed for endangering public order  had his     volume library confiscated  including copies of the Bible and Qur an and  when he applied for their restitution  was told all the books had been accidentally burnt       The Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity  which clings to a sense of a  paradise lost  before the changes brought out by the      conquest       g   Tourism Main article  Tourism in the Palestinian territories The Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims  Christians and Jews  and are endowed with a world class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims       The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation  Based on      figures  the Palestinian Dead Sea Coastline is roughly    km in length  of which        kilometres  could lend itself to the same tourist infrastructure developed by Jordan and Israel in their respective areas  Were Israel to permit a parallel development of this Palestinian sector  the World Bank estimates that       jobs would be added  allowing the Palestinian economy a potential value added input of something like      million annually       It is also the only maritime recreational outlet for West Bankers  but according to an Acri complaint to the Israeli Supreme Court in      Palestinians are often barred or turned away from the beaches at their only access point  the Beit Ha arava checkpoint on Route     Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches  h  The key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem  Bethlehem and Jericho  All access points are controlled by Israel and the road system  checkpoints and obstacles in place for visitors desiring to visit Palestinian towns leaves their hotels half empty       From    to    cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel       The general itineraries under Israeli management focus predominantly on Jewish history  Obstacles placed in the way of Palestinian managed tourism down to      included withholding licenses from tour guides  and hotels  for construction or renovation  and control of airports and highways  enabling Israel to develop a virtual monopoly on tourism        Demographics Main article  Demographics of the Palestinian territories  Palestinian girl in Nablus In December       an official census conducted by the Palestinian Authority found that the Palestinian Arab population of the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  was                      However  the World Bank and American Israeli Demographic Research Group identified a     discrepancy between first grade enrollment statistics documented by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  PCBS        projections       with questions also raised about the PCBS  growth assumptions for the period                 The Israeli Civil Administration put the number of Palestinians in the West Bank at           as of May                   Jewish children in Tal Menashe  There are         Israeli settlers living in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem       as well as around         living in Israeli annexed East Jerusalem  There are also small ethnic groups  such as the Samaritans living in and around Nablus  numbering in the hundreds       As of October       around        Palestinians in the West Bank worked in Israel every day  while another       worked in Israeli settlements  In addition  around        Palestinian traders from the West Bank were allowed to travel every day into Israel       By              Palestinians worked in Israel legally or illegally  twice as many as in            In       approximately     of Palestinians or         persons living in the West Bank were refugees or descendants of refugees from villages and towns located in what became Israel during the      Arab Israeli War  according to UNRWA statistics                 A      EU report titled  Area C and Palestinian State Building  reported that before the Israeli occupation in       between         and         Palestinians used to live in the Jordan Valley      which is in Area C  but demolition of Palestinian homes and prevention of new buildings has seen the number drop to             of which live in Area A  in Jericho                 In a similar period  the Jewish population in Area C has grown from       to

Main article  Palestinian freedom of movement   Restriction of movement in the West Bank In       the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had       km        mi  of roadways     It has been said that for  Jewish settlers  roads connect  for Palestinians  they separate        Between      and       the Israeli Defense Forces  IDF  built     miles of bypass roads in the territories  on appropriated land because they ran close to Palestinian villages       The given aim was said to be to afford protection to settlers from Palestinian sniping  bombing  and drive by shootings       For TAU emeritus professor of geography Elisha Efrat  they ignored the historical topography  road systems and environmental characteristics of the West Bank  and simply formed an apartheid network of  octopus arms which hold a grip on Palestinian population centres   i  A large number of embankments  concrete slabs and barriers impeded movement on primary and secondary roads   The result was to cantonize and fragment Palestinian townships  and cause endless obstacles to Palestinians going to work  schools  markets and relatives  j  Ramallah was cut off from all of its feeder villages in            Though prohibited by law  confiscation of Palestinian identity cards at checkpoints is a daily occurrence  At best drivers must wait for several hours for them to be returned  when  as can happen  the IDs themselves are lost as soldiers change shifts  in which case Palestinians are directed to some regional office the next day  and more checkpoints to get there       Even before the Al Aqsa Intifada  UNFPA estimated that     of pregnant West Bank women were unable to access prenatal care because of the difficulties and delays caused by crossing checkpoints  and dozens were forced to deliver their children on the roadside       Constant uncertainty and the inability to plan are the results for Palestinians of the Israeli military rules governing their movements   The World Bank noted that additional costs arising from longer travelling caused by restrictions on movement through three major routes in the West Bank alone ran to        USD     million a year  adding that other  earlier calculations        suggest restrictions on the Palestinian labour market cost the West Bank approximately US     million per annum  It concluded that such imposed restrictions had a major negative impact on the local economy  hindering stability and growth       In       official Israeli statistics indicated that there were         Palestinians on Israel s secret travel ban list      roadblocks and checkpoints were in place  October   the number of Palestinians licensed to drive private cars was        and the annual cost of permits was            These checkpoints  together with the separation wall and the restricted networks restructure the West Bank into  land cells   freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives       Israel sets up flying checkpoints without notice  Some       flying checkpoints were rigged up along West Bank roads  averaging some     a month  in       A further     unstaffed physical obstacles  such as dirt mounds  concrete blocks  gates and fenced sections had been placed on roads for Palestinian use  Of the gates erected at village entrances     were always closed       The checkpoint system did not ease up after the Oslo Accords  but was strengthened after them  which has been interpreted as suggesting their function is to assert control over Palestinians  and as a sign of an unwillingness to yield ground in the West Bank       According to PA Health Ministry statistics relating to the period from      to       of    Palestinian women who gave birth to their children while held up at checkpoints     miscarried and   died while delivering their child there       Machsom Watch accumulated over a mere five years              some        eyewitness reports and testimonies regarding the innumerable difficulties faced by Palestinians trying to negotiate West Bank checkpoints       Transportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted  and travel times can be inordinate  the Palestinian Authority has also been unable to develop roads  airports or railways in or through Area C       while many other roads were restricted only to public transportation and to Palestinians who have special permits from Israeli authorities                 At certain times  Israel maintained more than     checkpoints or roadblocks in the region       As such  movement restrictions were also placed on main roads traditionally used by Palestinians to travel between cities  and such restrictions are still blamed for poverty and economic depression in the West Bank       Underpasses and bridges     of which have been constructed and    of which are planned  link Palestinian areas separated from each other by Israeli settlements and bypass roads         Checkpoint before entering Jericho       Israeli restrictions were tightened in            There is a road  Route       which has a concrete wall dividing the two sides  one designated for Israeli vehicles  the other for Palestinian  The wall is designed to allow Palestinians to pass north south through Israeli held land and facilitate the building of additional Jewish settlements in the Jerusalem neighborhood       As of February      update   a plan for     kilometer rail network  establishing    new rail lines in West Bank  was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry  The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin  Nablus  Ramallah  Jerusalem  Ma aleh Adumim  Bethlehem and Hebron  Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea  Jericho and Beit She an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction  The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes  such as between Nablus and Tul Karm in the West Bank  and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan        Airports The only airport in the West Bank is the Atarot Airport near Ramallah  but it has been closed since        Telecom Main article  Telecommunications in the Palestinian territories The Palestinian Paltel telecommunication companies provide communication services such as landline  cellular network and Internet in the West Bank and Gaza Strip  Dialling code      is used in the West Bank and all over the Palestinian territories  Until       the Palestinian mobile market was monopolized by Jawwal  A new mobile operator for the territories launched in      under the name of Wataniya Telecom  The number of Internet users increased from        in      to         in             Radio and television The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts from an AM station in Ramallah on     kHz  numerous local privately owned stations are also in operation  Most Palestinian households have a radio and TV  and satellite dishes for receiving international coverage are widespread  Recently  PalTel announced and has begun implementing an initiative to provide ADSL broadband internet service to all households and businesses  Israel s cable television company HOT  satellite television provider  DBS  Yes  AM and FM radio broadcast stations and public television broadcast stations all operate  Broadband internet service by Bezeq s ADSL and by the cable company is available as well  The Al Aqsa Voice broadcasts from Dabas Mall in Tulkarem at       FM  The Al Aqsa TV station shares these

An Najah College in Nablus likewise became An Najah National University in            Hebron University was established as College of Shari a in      and became Hebron University in            Al Quds University was founded in       unifying several colleges and faculties in and around East Jerusalem       In       the Arab American University   the only private university in the West Bank   was founded outside of Zababdeh  with the purpose of providing courses according to the American system of education       Ariel University is located in the Israeli settlement of Ariel and was granted full university status on    July            It was established in       Most universities in the West Bank have politically active student bodies  and elections of student council officers are normally along party affiliations  Although the establishment of the universities was initially allowed by the Israeli authorities  some were sporadically ordered closed by the Israeli Civil Administration during the     s and     s to prevent political activities and violence against the IDF  Some universities remained closed by military order for extended periods during years immediately preceding and following the first Palestinian Intifada  but have largely remained open since the signing of the Oslo Accords despite the advent of the Al Aqsa Intifada  Second Intifada  in       The founding of Palestinian universities has greatly increased education levels among the population in the West Bank  According to a Birzeit University study  the percentage of Palestinians choosing local universities as opposed to foreign institutions has been steadily increasing  as of           of Palestinians with bachelor s degrees had obtained them from Palestinian institutions       According to UNESCO  Palestinians are one of the most highly educated groups in the Middle East  despite often difficult circumstances        The literacy rate among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  PCBS  is       for             See also West Bank closures Notes     According to Mansour  the population stood at

geographic area that has become irrevocably impaired by environmental damage or economic neglect            The one center of archaeological activity that might have provided a base for Palestinian archaeologists was the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem  which was under the control not of Jordan but of trustees made up of the directors of the several foreign schools of archaeology in the city  It is therefore not clear why persons like Dimitri Baramki did not continue their work as archaeologists employed by the Palestine Museum  In any event  Jordan nationalized the museum only months before the June      war  enabling the Israelis to claim it as theirs by right of conquest            Fourth  the disappearance of the Palestinian patrimony  material evidence  through the deliberate confiscation of Arab cultural resources by Israelis  such as the large library of Dr  Tawfiq Canaan in       the Palestine Archaeological Museum and its library in Jerusalem in       and the library of the Palestine Research Center in Beirut in        as well as the destruction of cultural property in the form of entire villages in          This last is particularly crucial  since the Palestinians  link to their past is largely through the villages  few towns  and fewer cities that predominated in their land during the last thirteen centuries           Israeli settlers forced to evacuate their settlements have also called their prior state as one of a  lost paradise            The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to  prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches    One of the reservists  Doron Karbel  testified that as a  side note   the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander  Colonel Yigal Slovik  had said the reason for the checkpoint was that  when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding yishuvim  Jewish communities               This imposed network of roads could be characterized by lack of consideration for the existing historical road network in the region  by inappropriateness of topography  by construction in marginal areas for a small population  by land confiscation of Arab villages  by lack of a logical hierarchy of roads with defined traffic functions  and above all by the development of a new road system as a means of territorial dominance of the region             With Palestinian traffic banned from all the main and secondary roads  clusters of yellow group taxis gather at each such barrier  and groups of people trying to get to work  school  clinics  universities  relatives houses  or markets clamber up and down sand embankments or across ditches to circumvent concrete slabs and soldiers  who sometimes shoot at them          Citations     Karayanni  Michael         Conflicts in

real controversy hovering over all the litigation on the security barrier concerns the fate of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories  Since       Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements established in the territories  motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel  This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests  taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before       where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge   The international community  for its part  has viewed this policy as patently illegal  based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation     Drew  Catriona          Self determination and population transfer    In Bowen  Stephen  ed    Human

can thus clearly be concluded that the transfer of Israeli settlers into the occupied territories violates not only the laws of belligerent occupation but the Palestinian right of self determination under international law  The question remains  however  whether this is of any practical value  In other words  given the view of the international community that the Israeli settlements are illegal under the law if belligerent occupation  what purpose does it serve to establish that an additional breach of international law has occurred     a b c d Domb  Fania         International Law and Armed

in the Palestinian territories   After initial post Oslo rates of about   percent in the mid     s  unemployment rose to    percent of the labor force in      with the onset of the second intifada and the imposition of severe movement and access restrictions  it has remained high ever since and is currently about    percent  What is more  almost    percent of the workforce is employed by the PA  an uncommonly high proportion that reflects the lack of dynamism in the private sector      West Bank and Gaza   Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy   World Bank    October       p     Archived  PDF  from the original on   August       While internal Palestinian political divisions have contributed to investor aversion to the Palestinian territories  Israeli restrictions on trade  movement and access are clearly the binding constraint to investment  these restrictions substantially increase the cost of trade and make it impossible to import many production inputs into the Palestinian territories  as illustrated  for instance  on the example of the telecommunications sector  For Gaza  the restrictions on import and export are in particular severe  In addition to the restrictions on labor movement between the Palestinian territories  the restrictions on movement of labor within the West Bank have been shown to have a strong impact on employability  wages  and economic growth  Israeli restrictions render much economic activity very difficult or impossible to conduct on about    percent of the West Bank territory  called Area C  Restrictions on movement and access  and the stunted potential of Area C      West Bank and Gaza   Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy   World Bank    October       p  viii  Archived  PDF  from the original on   August             assumed that the various physical  legal  regulatory and bureaucratic constraints that currently prevent investors from obtaining construction permits  and accessing land and water resources are lifted  as envisaged under the Interim Agreement        It is understood that realizing the full potential of such investments requires other changes as well   first  the rolling back of the movement and access restrictions in force outside Area C  which prevent the easy export of Palestinian products and inhibit tourists and investors from accessing Area C  and second  further reforms by the Palestinian Authority to better enable potential investors to register businesses  enforce contracts  and acquire finance        Neglecting indirect positive effects  we estimate that the potential additional output from the sectors evaluated in this report alone would amount to at least USD     billion per annum in valued added terms   a sum equivalent to    percent of      Palestinian GDP  The bulk of this would come from agriculture and Dead Sea minerals exploitation        x  Tapping this potential output could dramatically improve the PA s fiscal position  Even without any improvements in the efficiency of tax collection  at the current rate of tax GDP of    percent the additional tax revenues associated with such an increase in GDP would amount to some USD     million  Assuming that expenditures remain at the same level  this extra resource would notionally cut the fiscal deficit by half   significantly reducing the need for donor recurrent budget support  This major improvement in fiscal sustainability would in turn generate significant positive reputational benefits for the PA and would considerably enhance investor confidence  xi  The impact on Palestinian livelihoods would be impressive  An increase in GDP equivalent to    percent would be expected to create substantial employment  sufficient to put a significant dent in the currently high rate of unemployment  If an earlier estimated one to one relationship between growth and employment was to hold  this increase in GDP would lead to a    percent increase in employment  This level of growth in employment would also put a large dent in poverty  as recent estimates show that unemployed Palestinians are twice as likely to be poor as their employed counterparts     Amnesty

analysis suggests that less than one percent of the land in Area C is currently available to Palestinians for construction  permit data also shows that it is almost impossible to obtain permission to build in Area C  Less than   percent of all requests made between      and      secured approval  This situation applies not only to housing but to public economic infrastructure  roads  water reservoirs  waste treatment plants  and industrial plant  and to the access roads and utility lines needed to connect Areas A and B across Area C        The outbreak of the second Intifada in      interrupted this trend  bringing increased violence and uncertainty   and most significantly  the intensification by Israel of a complex set of security related restrictions that impeded the movement of people and goods and fragmented the Palestinian territories into small enclaves lacking economic cohesion        Transportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted  and travel times can be inordinate  the Palestinian Authority has also been unable to develop roads  airports or railways in or through Area C      Westbank
