originally the London Broadcasting Company  is a London based national phone in and talk radio station   It was the UK s first licensed commercial radio station  and began to broadcast on Monday   October          a week ahead of Capital Radio  The launch of LBC also saw the beginning of Independent Radio News broadcasting  as LBC provided the service to independent local radio stations nationwide  LBC broadcast only to London until       at which time it became available  via digital radio  in some other parts of the country  It has been available nationwide since       LBC is owned by Global and has a like branded sister station   LBC News   which is dedicated to rolling news  travel and weather  For a number of years  this station operated as a part time station broadcasting

presenter  he opened the station just before   a m  on Monday   October       The original station had several presenters who became household names in the British media  These include Adrian Love  Jon Snow  Peter Allen  Rosie Boycott  and Bel Mooney  For    years from      the  breakfast show AM was presented by Bob Holness and Douglas Cameron  LBC s late evening interview and phone in programme between   p m   later    p m   and   a m  was called Nightline and at various times was hosted by Adrian Love  Robin Houston  Monty Modlyn  Jeremy Beadle and Tommy Boyd  There was also a character called  Mr Nasty   played by John Forest   who argued over the telephone with children  Beadle and Forrest went on to star in the Granada Television series Fun Factory  Bob Holness  Douglas Cameron  Peter Allen  Jon Snow  Brian Hayes and Jeremy Beadle  among others  were promoted by Ron Onions  Editorial Director of LBC Radio and IRN          Ron Onions was one of the leading lights of commercial radio news and current affairs in Britain in the     s and helped to create a new approach to broadcasting  in counterpoint to the BBC for which he had once worked  Onions was the brains behind LBC  London Broadcasting Company  and its sister  the national commercial radio news service IRN  Independent Radio News  In place of the BBC s gravitas  he introduced a lighter jauntier approach to news presentation akin to that of a tabloid newspaper  He was influenced by American broadcasting from his time as the BBC s New York organiser  and introduced the three minute  snapshot  bulletin in which news was always moving forward  rather than just a summary of recent history  It helped to pave the way for a concept of  rolling news  Onions employed a talented team of young reporters and  by way of a backhanded compliment  the BBC  along with ITN and Channel    was not slow to recruit from the Onions stable of go getters  Onions launched the careers of the journalists Jon Snow and Peter Allen engaged Carol Thatcher as a phone in host and made figures such as Bob Holness  Dickie Arbiter and Douglas Cameron household names  Onions had brisk and exacting standards allied to charm and a quirky good humour  He was adept at coining journalistic mantras such as  good news bad  bad news good   Tough though he could be  he was instinctively kind and considerate and won many friends among his employers   Changes of ownership edit  Originally owned by a consortium led by the Canadian Selkirk Communications of Vancouver British Columbia  with a     stake  LBC was sold in       beginning a turbulent commercial history  The new owners were media company Darling Downs  later renamed Crown Communications  owned by Australian entrepreneur David Haynes   Crown sold the station s original base in Gough Square near Fleet Street in the City of London and relocated to Hammersmith  and in      split the station into two separate services  the news and comment station LBC Crown FM  and the phone in London Talkback Radio on AM  The transition was not initially well received  and substantially increased costs  pushing the company into the red  In       the company was sold to Shirley Porter s Chelverton Investments  after Crown fell into financial difficulties      London News Radio edit  On the morning of Friday  September  rd        the Radio Authority announced it would not renew the company s two licences  LBC Newstalk and London Talkback Radio  awarding the frequencies instead to London News Radio  a consortium led by former LBC staff and backed by Guinness Mahon     Staff at the station were in shock  not least because while they had received a tip off from the Financial Times that they looked set to lose one of their frequencies  they did not expect to lose both  This was one of only a handful of times the UK media regulator had declined to renew the license of an incumbent station  The prospective loss of the franchise brought Chelverton to the brink of collapse     and London News Radio  soon itself taken over by Reuters  bought LBC to keep it on air until the official handover date of October          London News Radio operated the station from LBC s former studios in Hammersmith as London News       a rolling news and travel information service on the FM band  and the phone in driven service London News Talk      on the MW band  These names were simplified slightly in mid      to News      and News Talk      respectively  but between October      and July      the LBC name was not used on air at all   Return of LBC edit  Reuters then brought in additional shareholders  and between      and      LBC was part of London News Radio Limited  a company owned jointly by ITN  Daily Mail and General Trust  Reuters  and the GWR Group  This new consortium revived the LBC name on     AM on   July       At the end of       the FM service was relaunched as News Direct     FM  Production for the station was moved to the basement of ITN s multimedia building in Gray s Inn Road   Chrysalis edit  In       the company was bought for      m by the media company Chrysalis           which trumpeted its purchase with the promise that it would lift the listenership to at least one million from around          LBC had enjoyed an audience of more than two million in the early     s   Production was moved to Chrysalis s base in North Kensington  and the formatting of the two frequencies was swapped  the talk format moving to FM and the news format to AM     Mark Flanagan  the station s Managing Director  left Chrysalis in      to set up a political consultancy company  and was replaced by David Lloyd      Some who   claimed he held no previous experience in the talk and chat radio genre  which overlooked the almost two years he spent with the Century FM brand in its Border TV ownership days where the station was a       music talk service  He also introduced a podcasting service called LBC Plus  and a number of premium rate promotional opportunities to replace falling advertising revenues experienced by the radio sector  In September       the LBC      station became available in some other parts of the country on the digital DAB platform  after Chrysalis bought out its partners and closed the Digital News Network rolling news station  which had previously been carried on the MXR multiplex  Each multiplex region   the North West  West Midlands  Yorkshire  North East  South Wales  and the West   broadcast the London LBC transmission  augmented with occasional bulletins of regional news and travel information           Global Radio edit  In February       Chrysalis confirmed media speculation that it was reviewing the entire radio operation at its investors  request      Further media speculation from The Guardian suggested that the group had little option  due to shareholder pressure  to sell its radio arm  including LBC  raising up to      million for new acquisitions  while The Daily Telegraph suggested that it could be the subject of a management buyout  Subsequently it was announced on    June      that LBC along with its sister stations The Arrow  Heart  and Galaxy network were to be sold for      million to Global Radio by the Chrysalis Group  whose Chrysalis Radio operation closed down      In December      the station moved to the Capital London studios in Leicester Square  In April       a new marketing slogan for  what was then called  LBC      was introduced   London s Biggest Conversation   a play on the station s initials      Towards the end of October       the station ceased DAB broadcasts to some parts of the country  On    January       LBC announced its intention to return to the DAB platform and began broadcasting nationally at   am on    February      under a new slogan   Leading Britain s Conversation   LBC took up the slot previously occupied by Jazz FM  and briefly Birdsong   and dropped the        from the station name to reinforce the notion that it now had national coverage           Podcasting edit  LBC claimed to be the first radio station in the world to provide full length podcasts for all its major shows  plus podcast only shows and other things such as backstage interviews and mp s sent to the show  under the name LBC Plus  Most of their podcasts required a small subscription fee  Some shows  including  best of  programmes  podcast only shows and  bitesize  versions of programmes  were free      The full length  paid podcast service has now ceased  and shows are now available for   days on Global Player       Controversies edit  Tony Blair appearance edit  On    January       then British Prime Minister Tony Blair presented an hour long phone in show on the station  taking pre booked calls from LBC      listeners  His appearance was part of the  Big Conversation  initiative to promote government as being more accessible and in touch with the people  During the       am show  a caller explained that he d been denied access to his children for five years and asked what Blair was planning to do about other fathers in a similar situation  The Prime Minister assured the caller he would look into his case personally  It later transpired that the caller was in fact Fathers   Justice member Ron Davis  who in May of that year was arrested for entering Parliament and throwing a condom containing purple powder over Blair and nearby Cabinet members  Davis claimed the attack was in response to the Prime Minister s failure to contact him or look into the matters discussed on LBC                    Jeni Barnett and MMR vaccine controversy edit  Main article  Jeni Barnett        MMR vaccine controversy The radio station became involved in the MMR vaccine controversy after a broadcast by Jeni Barnett on   January      in which she debated the putative dangers of MMR vaccine with callers  It became the subject of media controversy  first because her views were criticised as irresponsible by medical journalist Dr Ben Goldacre  and then because LBC and Global Radio threatened legal action against Goldacre for copyright infringement after he refused to remove the audio of the show from his blog  which resulted in its being made available at Wikileaks and elsewhere and the preparation of transcripts of the broadcast  David Aaronovitch in The Times argued for  a class action against LBC for permitting a presenter to inflict her preposterous prejudices on her listeners  to the detriment of someone else s kids       Norman Lamb MP tabled an Early Day Motion criticising Barnett and LBC for the likely effect of the broadcast on public health       Notable presenters edit     Nick Abbot Steve Allen David Buik  guest  Andrew Castle Clive Bull Iain Dale Nick

then given a three hour Sunday afternoon show  starting on    September       after he lost his seat in the      general election  LBC launched a call in consumer law show  called  The Consumer Hour  in       The show was hosted by Clive Bull with listeners  questions answered by guest consumer lawyer Dean Dunham  The show ran until September       In September      LBC relaunched The Consumer
