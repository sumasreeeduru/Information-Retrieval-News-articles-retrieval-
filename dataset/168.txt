September      to   November      but ruled parts of it as early as       He reconquered his family s ancestral home city of Riyadh in       starting three decades of conquests that made him the ruler

 Early life and family origins edit  Ibn Saud was born on    January      in Riyadh in the region called Najd in central Arabia        He was the son of Abdul Rahman bin Faisal  last ruler of the Emirate of Nejd  the  Second Saudi State   a tribal sheikhdom centered on Riyadh  Ibn Saud s mother was a member of the Sudairi family     Sara bint Ahmed Al Sudairi     She died in          His full siblings were Faisal  Noura  Bazza  Haya and Saad      His family  the House of Saud  had been a power in central Arabia for the previous     years  Under the influence and inspiration of Wahhabi Islam  the Saudis had previously attempted to control much of the Arabian peninsula in the form of the Emirate of Diriyah  the  First Saudi State   until its destruction by an Ottoman army in the Ottoman Wahhabi War in the early nineteenth century      In       the House of Saud s long term regional rivals  the Rashidis  conquered Riyadh  Ibn Saud was    at the time      He and his family initially took refuge with the Al Murrah  a Bedouin tribe in the southern desert of Arabia  Later  the Al Sauds moved to Qatar and stayed there for two months      Their next stop was Bahrain where they stayed briefly  The Ottoman State allowed them to settle in Kuwait      and they settled there where they lived for nearly a decade      In the spring of       Ibn Saud and some relatives  including a half brother  Mohammad  and several cousins  set out on a raiding expedition into the Najd  targeting mainly tribes associated with the Rashidis  As the raid proved profitable  it attracted more participants  The raiders  numbers peaked at over      but numbers dwindled over the ensuing months  citation needed  In the autumn  the group made camp in the Yabrin oasis  While observing Ramadan  he decided to attack Riyadh and retake it from the Al Rashid  On the night of    January       he led    men over the walls of the city on tilted palm trees and took the city      The Rashidi governor of the city  Ajlan  was killed in front of his own fortress  The Saudi recapture of the city marked the beginning of the Third Saudi State   Rise to power edit   King Ibn Saud signature in a document to Eqab bin Muhaya Following the capture of Riyadh  many former supporters of the House of Saud rallied to Ibn Saud s call to arms  He was a charismatic leader and kept his men supplied with arms  Over the next two years  he and his forces recaptured almost half of the Najd from the Rashidis  In       Abdulaziz of Al Rashid  a k a  Ibn Rashid  appealed to the Ottoman Empire for military protection and assistance  The Ottomans responded by sending troops into Arabia  On    June       Ibn Saud s forces suffered a major defeat at the hands of the combined Ottoman and Rashidi forces  His forces regrouped and began to wage guerrilla warfare against the Ottomans  Over the next two years  he was able to disrupt their supply routes  forcing them to retreat  The victory of Ibn Saud in Rawdat Muhanna  in which Ibn Rashid died  ended the Ottoman presence in Najd and Qassim by the end of October       He completed his conquest of the Najd and the eastern coast of Arabia in       He then founded the Ikhwan  a military religious brotherhood  which was to assist in his later conquests  with the approval of local Salafi ulema  In the same year  he instituted an agrarian policy to settle the nomadic pastoralist Bedouins into colonies and to replace their tribal organizations with allegiance to the Ikhwan  During World War I  the British government established diplomatic relations with Ibn Saud  The British agent  Captain William Shakespear  was well received by the Bedouin      Similar diplomatic missions were established with any Arabian power who might have been able to unify and stabilize the region  The British entered into the Treaty of Darin in December       which made the lands of the House of Saud a British protectorate and attempted to define the boundaries of the developing Saudi state      In exchange  Ibn Saud pledged to again make war against Ibn Rashid  who was an ally of the Ottomans  The British Foreign Office had previously begun to support Sharif Hussein bin Ali  Emir of the Hejaz by sending T  E  Lawrence  a k a  Lawrence of Arabia  to him in       The Saudi Ikhwan began to conflict with Hussein  Sharif of Mecca also in       just as his sons Abdullah and Faisal entered Damascus  The Treaty of Darin remained in effect until superseded by the Jeddah conference of      and the Dammam conference of       during both of which Ibn Saud extended his boundaries past the Anglo Ottoman Blue Line  After Darin  he stockpiled the weapons and supplies which the British provided him  including a  tribute  of        per month      After World War I  he received further support from the British  including a glut of surplus munitions  He launched his campaign against the Al Rashidi in       by      they had been all but destroyed  The defeat of the Al Rashidi doubled the size of Saudi territory because  after the war of Ha il  Ibn Saud sent his army to occupy Al Jouf and the army led by Eqab bin Mohaya  the head of Talhah tribe  This allowed Ibn Saud the leverage to negotiate a new and more favorable treaty with the British  Their treaty  signed at Uqair in       where he met Percy Cox  British High Commissioner in Iraq  to draw boundaries     saw Britain recognize many of his territorial gains  In exchange  Ibn Saud agreed to recognize British territories in the area  particularly along the Persian Gulf coast and in Iraq  The former of these were vital to the British  as merchant traffic between British India and the United Kingdom depended upon coaling stations on the approach to the Suez Canal  In       Ibn Saud s forces captured the holy city of Mecca from Sharif Hussein  ending     years of Hashemite rule  On   January       the leading figures in Mecca  Madina and Jeddah proclaimed Ibn Saud the King of Hejaz      He raised Najd to a kingdom as well on    January           On    May       the British government signed the Treaty of Jeddah  which abolished the Darin protection agreement and recognized the independence of the Hejaz and Najd  with Ibn Saud as their ruler  For the next five years  Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units  With international recognition and support  Ibn Saud continued to consolidate his power  By       his forces had overrun most of the central Arabian Peninsula  but the alliance between the Ikhwan and the Al Saud collapsed when Ibn Saud forbade further raiding  The few portions of central Arabia that had not been overrun by the Saudi Ikhwan forces had treaties with London  and Ibn Saud was sober enough to see the folly of provoking the British by pushing into these areas  This did not sit well with the Ikhwan  who had been taught that all non Wahhabis were infidels  Tensions finally boiled over when the Ikhwan rebelled  After two years of fighting  they were suppressed by Ibn Saud in the Battle of Sabilla in March           On    September       Ibn Saud formally united his realm into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  with himself as its king      He transferred his court to Murabba Palace from the Masmak Fort in          and the palace remained his residence and the seat of government until his death in           Ibn Saud had to first eliminate the right of his own father in order to rule  and then distance and contain the ambitions of his five brothers  particularly his oldest brother  Muhammad  who had fought with him during the battles and conquests that gave birth to the state       Oil discovery and his rule edit   St  John Philby Petroleum was discovered in Saudi Arabia in      by Socal  after Ibn Saud granted a concession in           Through his advisers St John Philby and Ameen Rihani  Ibn Saud granted substantial authority over Saudi oil fields to American oil companies in       Beginning in       he signed the  friendship and cooperation  pact with Britain to keep his militia in line and cease any further attacks against their protectorates for whom they were responsible  His newfound oil wealth brought with it a great deal of power and influence that Ibn Saud would use to advantage in the Hijaz  He forced many nomadic tribes to settle down and abandon  petty wars  and vendettas  He also began widespread enforcement of the new kingdom s ideology  based on the teachings of Muhammad Ibn Abd al Wahhab  This included an end to traditionally sanctioned rites of pilgrimage  recognized by the orthodox schools of jurisprudence  but at odds with those sanctioned by Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab  In       after a caravan of Egyptians on the way to Mecca were beaten by his forces for playing bugles  he was impelled to issue a conciliatory statement to the Egyptian government  In fact  several such statements were issued to Muslim governments around the world as a result of beatings suffered by the pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina  citation needed  With the uprising and subsequent decimation thereafter of the Ikhwan in      via British air power  the     s marked a turning point  With his rivals eliminated  Ibn Saud s ideology was in full force  ending nearly      years of accepted religious practices surrounding the Hajj  the majority of which were sanctioned by a millennium of scholarship  Ibn Saud established a Shura Council of the Hijaz as early as       This Council was later expanded to    members  and was chaired by the king s son  Faisal       Foreign wars edit  Ibn Saud was able to gain loyalty from tribes near Saudi Arabia  tribes such as those in Jordan  For example  he built very strong ties with Prince Rashed Al Khuzai from the Al Fraihat tribe  one of the most influential and royally established families during the Ottoman Empire  The Prince and his tribe had dominated eastern Jordan before the arrival of Sharif Hussein  Ibn Saud supported Prince Rashed and his followers in rebellion against Hussein      Prince Rashed supported Izz ad Din al Qassam s defiance in      which led him and his followers in rebellion against Abdullah I of Jordan  In       when they were forced to leave Jordan  Prince Rashed Al Khuzai  his family  and a group of his followers chose to move to Saudi Arabia  where Prince Rashedi lived for several years in Ibn Saud s hospitality                   Later years edit   King Ibn Saud converses with President Franklin D  Roosevelt  right  through interpreter Colonel Bill Eddy  on board the USS Quincy  after the Yalta Conference  Fleet Admiral William D  Leahy  left  watches  Ibn Saud positioned Saudi Arabia as neutral in World War II  but was generally considered to favor the Allies      However  in       when an attack on a main British pipeline in the Kingdom of Iraq was found to be connected to the German Ambassador  Fritz Grobba  Ibn Saud provided Grobba with refuge      It was reported that he had been disfavoring the British as of           In the last stage of the war  Ibn Saud met significant political figures  One of these meetings  which lasted for three days  was with U S  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on    February           The meeting took place on board USS Quincy in the Great Bitter Lake segment of the Suez Canal          The meeting laid down the basis of the future relations between the two countries      The other meeting was with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the Grand Hotel du Lac on the shores of the Fayyoun Oasis  fifty miles south of Cairo  in February           Saudis report that the meeting heavily focused on the Palestine problem and was unproductive in terms of its outcomes  in contrast to that with Roosevelt      In       Ibn Saud participated in the Arab Israeli War  but Saudi Arabia s contribution was generally considered token      Following the naming of Prince Saud as his heir Ibn Saud left most of his duties to him  and he spent most of his time in Ta if      While most of the royal family desired luxuries such as gardens  splendid cars  and palaces  Ibn Saud wanted a royal railway from the Persian Gulf to Riyadh and then an extension to Jeddah  This was regarded by all of his advisers living in the country as an old man s folly  Eventually  ARAMCO built the railway  at a cost of     million  drawn from the King s oil royalties  It was completed in      and was used commercially after the king s death  It enabled Riyadh to grow into a relatively modern city  But when a paved road was built in       the railway lost its traffic       Personal life edit  Further information  House of

Saud headed a polygamous household comprising several wives and concubines  According to some sources  he had twenty two consorts  Mohammed Leopold Weiss reported in      that one of his spouses poisoned him in      which caused poor sight of one eye      He later forgave her  but at the same time divorced her      On the other hand  many of his marriages were contracted in order to cement alliances with other clans  during the period when the Saudi state was founded and stabilized  He was the father of almost a hundred children  including forty five sons   Ibn Saud was a tall man     standing between      m    ft   in          and      m    ft   in        Relations with family members edit  Ibn Saud was said to be very close to his paternal aunt  Jawhara bint Faisal  From a young age  she ingrained in him a strong sense of family destiny and motivated him to regain the lost glory of the House of Saud  During the years when the Saud family were living almost as refugees in Kuwait  Jawhara bint Faisal frequently recounted the deeds of his ancestors to Abdulaziz and exhorted him not to be content with the existing situation  She was instrumental in making him decide to return to Najd from Kuwait and regain the territories of his family  She was well educated in Islam  in Arab custom and in tribal and clan relationships  She remained among the king s most trusted and influential advisors all her life  Ibn Saud asked her about the experiences of past rulers and the historical allegiance and the roles of tribes and individuals  Jawhara was also deeply respected by the king s children  Ibn Saud visited her daily until she died around           Ibn Saud was also very close to his sister Noura  who was one year older than him  On several occasions  he identified himself in public with the words   I am the brother of Noura          Noura died a few years before Ibn Saud      Assassination attempts edit  On    March       three armed men attacked and tried to assassinate Ibn Saud during his performance of Hajj          He survived the attack unhurt and three assassins were arrested          Another assassination attempt targeted Ibn Saud occurred in      when Captain pilot Abdullah al Mandili who was a member of Royal Saudi Air Force tried to bomb his camp from an airplane      His attempt was unsuccessful  and al Mandili escaped to Iraq with the help of tribes       Successor edit  He appointed his second son Prince Saud heir to the Saudi throne in       He had many quarrels with his elder brother Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman as to who should be appointed heir  Muhammad wanted his son Khalid to be designated the heir  Ibn Saud s eldest son was Turki Al Awwal  who was the Crown Prince of the Kingdoms of Nejd and Hejaz  but Turki died at age     predeceasing his father  and his younger full brother was appointed Crown Prince  Had Turki not died  he would have been the Crown Prince  Ibn Saud had    sons  of whom    survived to adulthood  Ten of his sons were capable enough to be candidates for the succession  They were Saud  Faisal  Muhammad  Khalid  Fahd  Abdullah  Sultan  Nayef  Salman and Muqrin  Of these ten  six became king  Muhammad  Sultan  Nayef and Muqrin were crown prince but never succeeded the throne  Muhammad resigned from the post  Sultan and Nayef predeceased King Abdullah  and Muqrin was removed from the post by his brother King Salman in April        Views edit  In regard to essential values for the state and people  he said   Two things are essential to our state and our people     religion and the rights inherited from our fathers       Amani Hamdan argues that the attitude of Ibn Saud towards women s education was encouraging since he expressed his support in a conversation with St John Philby in which he stated   It is permissible for women to read       His last words to his two sons  the future King Saud and the next in line Prince Faisal  who were already battling each other  were  You are brothers  unite       Shortly before his death  Ibn Saud stated   Verily  my children and my possessions are my enemies        Death and funeral edit  Ibn Saud was experiencing heart disease in his

birthday has been a source of debate  It is generally accepted as       although a few sources give it as       According to British author Robert Lacey s book The Kingdom  a leading Saudi historian found records that show Ibn Saud in      greeting an important tribal delegation  The historian reasoned that a nine or ten year old child  as given by the      birth date  would have been too young to be allowed to greet such a delegation  while an adolescent of    or     as given by the      date  would likely have been allowed  When Lacey interviewed one of Ibn Saud s sons prior to writing the book  the son recalled that his father often laughed at records showing his birth date to be       Ibn Saud s response to such records was reportedly that  I swallowed four years of my life   p
