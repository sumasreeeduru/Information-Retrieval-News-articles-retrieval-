      Right  Flag of the United Kingdom       present All areas of the world that were ever part of the British Empire  Current British Overseas Territories have their names underlined in red  The British Empire was composed of the dominions  colonies  protectorates  mandates  and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states  It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late   th and early   th centuries  At its height it was the largest empire in history and  for over a century  was the foremost global power     By      the British Empire held sway over     million people      of the world population at the time     and by      it covered            km              sq mi          of the Earth s total land area     As a result  its constitutional  legal  linguistic  and cultural legacy is widespread  At the peak of its power  the phrase  the empire on which the sun never sets  was often used to describe the British Empire as the Sun was always shining on at least one of its territories     During the Age of Discovery in the   th and   th centuries  Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe  and in the process established large overseas empires  Envious of the great wealth these empires generated     England  France  and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia     A series of wars in the   th and   th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then  following the union between England and Scotland in       Great Britain  the dominant colonial power in North America  Britain became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company s conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in       The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in      after the American War of Independence resulted in Britain losing some of its oldest and most populous colonies  British attention soon turned towards Asia  Africa  and the Pacific  After the defeat of France in the Napoleonic Wars              Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the   th century  and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe     The period of relative peace in Europe and the world             during which the British Empire became the global hegemon was later described as Pax Britannica   British Peace               In the early   th century  the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain  so that by the time of the Great Exhibition in       the country was described as the  workshop of the world       Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its colonies  its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions  such as Asia and Latin America          During the   th century  Britain s population increased at a dramatic rate  accompanied by rapid urbanisation  which caused significant social and economic stresses      To seek new markets and sources of raw materials  the British government under Benjamin Disraeli initiated a period of imperial expansion in Egypt  South Africa and elsewhere  Canada  Australia  and New Zealand became self governing dominions      By the start of the   th century  Germany and the United States had begun to challenge Britain s economic lead  Military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War  during which Britain relied heavily on its empire  The conflict placed enormous strain on the military  financial  and manpower resources of Britain  Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I  Britain was no longer the world s pre eminent industrial or military power  In the Second World War  Britain s colonies in East and Southeast Asia were occupied by Japan  Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies  the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire  India  Britain s most valuable and populous possession  achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire  The Suez Crisis confirmed Britain s decline as a global power  and the transfer of Hong Kong to China in      marked for many the end of the British Empire          Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty  After independence  many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations  a free association of independent states  The United Kingdom is now one of    Commonwealth nations  a grouping known informally as the Commonwealth realms  that share a

 John Cabot s ship used for his second voyage to the New World The foundations of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms  In       King Henry VII of England  following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration  commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic     Cabot sailed in       five years after the European discovery of America  but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland  and  mistakenly believing  like Christopher Columbus  that he had reached Asia      there was no attempt to found a colony  Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was ever heard of his ships again      No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I  during the last decades of the   th century      In the meantime  the      Statute in Restraint of Appeals had declared  that this realm of England is an Empire       The Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies     In       the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa     with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic slave trade  This effort was rebuffed and later  as the Anglo Spanish Wars intensified  Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic  laden with treasure from the New World      At the same time  influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee  who was the first to use the term  British Empire       were beginning to press for the establishment of England s own empire  By this time  Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean  Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China  and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area  later to become New France      Although England tended to trail behind Portugal  Spain  and France in establishing overseas colonies  it established its first overseas colony in   th century Ireland by settling it with Protestants from England drawing on precedents dating back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in               Several people who helped establish colonies in Ireland also later played a part in the early colonisation of North America  particularly a group known as the West Country men       English overseas possessions             edit  Main article  English overseas possessions In       Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration      That year  Gilbert sailed for the Caribbean with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America  but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic          In       he embarked on a second attempt  On this occasion he formally claimed the harbour of the island of Newfoundland  although no settlers were left behind  Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England  and was succeeded by his half brother  Walter Raleigh  who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in       Later that year  Raleigh founded the Roanoke Colony on the coast of present day North Carolina  but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail      In       James VI  King of Scots  ascended  as James I  to the English throne and in      negotiated the Treaty of London  ending hostilities with Spain  Now at peace with its main rival  English attention shifted from preying on other nations  colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies      The British Empire began to take shape during the early   th century  with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean  and the establishment of joint stock companies  most notably the East India Company  to administer colonies and overseas trade  This period  until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the   th century  has been referred to by some historians as the  First British Empire        Americas  Africa and the slave trade edit  Main articles  British colonisation of the Americas  British America  Thirteen Colonies  and Atlantic slave trade The Caribbean initially provided England s most important and lucrative colonies      but not before several attempts at colonisation failed  An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in      lasted only two years  and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits      Colonies in St Lucia        and Grenada        also rapidly folded  but settlements were successfully established in St  Kitts         Barbados        and Nevis             The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil  which depended on slave labour  and at first Dutch ships  to sell the slaves and buy the sugar      To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands  Parliament decreed in      that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies  This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces a series of Anglo Dutch Wars which would eventually strengthen England s position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch      In       England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish  and in      succeeded in colonising the Bahamas      England s first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in      in Jamestown  led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company  Bermuda was settled and claimed by England as a result of the      shipwreck of the Virginia Company s flagship  and in      was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company      The Virginia Company s charter was revoked in      and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown  thereby founding the Colony of Virginia      The London and Bristol Company was created in      with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland  but was largely unsuccessful      In       Plymouth was founded as a haven for Puritan religious separatists  later known as the Pilgrims      Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would be colonists to risk the arduous trans Atlantic voyage  Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics         Rhode Island        as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut        for Congregationalists  The Province of Carolina was founded in       With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in       England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland  renaming it New York  This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo Dutch War  in exchange for Suriname      In       the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn  The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean  but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates        African slaves working in   th century Virginia  by an unknown artist       In       Charles II incorporated by royal charter the Hudson s Bay Company  HBC   granting it a monopoly on the fur trade in the area known as Rupert s Land  which would later form a large proportion of the Dominion of Canada  Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French  who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France      Two years later  the Royal African Company was inaugurated  receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean      From the outset  slavery was the basis of the Empire in the West Indies  Until the abolition of its slave trade in       Britain was responsible for the transportation of     million African slaves to the Americas  a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic      To facilitate this trade  forts were established on the coast of West Africa  such as James Island  Accra and Bunce Island  In the British Caribbean  the percentage of the population of African descent rose from     in      to around     in       and in the Thirteen Colonies from     to     over the same period  the majority in the southern colonies       For the slave traders  the trade was extremely profitable  and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol  Glasgow and Liverpool  which formed the third corner of the triangular trade with Africa and the Americas  For the transported  harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven       Rivalry with other European empires edit   Fort St  George was founded at Madras in       At the end of the   th century  England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal s monopoly of trade with Asia  forming private joint stock companies to finance the voyages the English  later British  East India Company and the Dutch East India Company  chartered in      and      respectively  The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade  an effort focused mainly on two regions  the East Indies archipelago  and an important hub in the trade network  India  There  they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other      Although England eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power  in the short term the Netherlands  more advanced financial system     and the three Anglo Dutch Wars of the   th century left it with a stronger position in Asia  Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of      when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne  bringing peace between the Netherlands and England  A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England  but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability      Peace between England and the Netherlands in      meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years  War as allies  but the conflict waged in Europe and overseas between France  Spain and the Anglo Dutch alliance left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch  who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe      The death of Charles II of Spain in      and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou  a grandson of the King of France  raised the prospect of the unification of France  Spain and their respective colonies  an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe      In       England  Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession  which lasted for thirteen years       Scottish attempt to expand overseas edit  Main article  Scottish colonization of the Americas In       the Parliament of Scotland granted a charter to the Company of Scotland  which established a settlement in      on the Isthmus of Panama  Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada  and afflicted by malaria  the colony was abandoned two years later  The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland a quarter of Scottish capital     was lost in the enterprise and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire  The episode also had major political consequences  helping to persuade the government of Scotland of the merits of a union of the two countries  rather than just crowns        First  British Empire             edit  The   th century saw the newly united Great Britain rise to be the world s dominant colonial power  with France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage      Great Britain  Portugal  the Netherlands  and the Holy Roman Empire continued the War of the Spanish Succession  which lasted until      and was concluded by the Treaty of Utrecht  Philip V of Spain renounced his and his descendants  claim to the French throne  and Spain lost its empire in Europe      The British Empire was territorially enlarged  from France  Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia  and from Spain Gibraltar and Menorca  Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean  Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento  permission to sell African slaves in Spanish America  to Britain      After the Anglo Spanish War of            the King of Spain confiscated all British ships in his ports in New Spain  In       Spanish patrol boat La Isabela boarded the British brig Rebecca off Havana and Captain Julio Le n Fandi o cut off the left ear of Captain Robert Jenkins  accusing him of being a smuggler  In August       two more British ships were boarded by Spanish coastguards near Havana  the crews were imprisoned and kept as slaves      With the outbreak of the Anglo Spanish War of Jenkins  Ear in       Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the Triangle Trade routes  In       the Spanish and British began peace talks  with the King of Spain agreeing to stop all attacks on British shipping  however  in the Treaty of Madrid Britain lost its slave trading rights in South and Central America        Robert Clive s victory at the Battle of Plassey established the East India Company as a military as well as a commercial power  In the East Indies  British and Dutch merchants continued to compete in spices and textiles  With textiles becoming the larger trade  by       in terms of sales  the British company had overtaken the Dutch      During the middle decades of the   th century  there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent  as the English East India Company and its French counterpart  struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire  The Battle of Plassey in       in which the British defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies  left the British East India Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India      France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states  ending French hopes of controlling India      In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control  either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the Presidency Armies  the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys  led by British officers      The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global Seven Years  War             involving France  Britain  and the other major European powers      The signing of the Treaty of Paris of      had important consequences for the future of the British Empire  In North America  France s future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert s Land      and the ceding of New France to Britain  leaving a sizeable French speaking population under British control  and Louisiana to Spain  Spain ceded Florida to Britain  Along with its victory over France in India  the Seven Years  War therefore left Britain as the world s most powerful maritime power       Loss of the Thirteen American Colonies edit  Main article  American Revolutionary War  British colonies in the Americas             Thirteen Colonies  During the     s and early     s  relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained  primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament s attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent      This was summarised at the time by the slogan  No taxation without representation   a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen  The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self government  In response  Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule  leading to the outbreak of war in       The following year  in       the United States declared independence  The entry of French and Spanish forces into the war tipped the military balance in the Americans  favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in       Britain began negotiating peace terms  American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in           The loss of such a large portion of British America  at the time Britain s most populous overseas possession  is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the  first  and  second  empires      in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia  the Pacific and later Africa  Adam Smith s Wealth of Nations  published in       had argued that colonies were redundant  and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion  dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal          The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after      seemed to confirm Smith s view that political control was not necessary for economic success          The war to the south influenced British policy in Canada  where between        and             defeated Loyalists had migrated from the new United States following independence      The        Loyalists who went to the Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys  then part of Nova Scotia  felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax  so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in           The Constitutional Act of      created the provinces of Upper Canada  mainly English speaking  and Lower Canada  mainly French speaking  to defuse tensions between the French and British communities  and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain  with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution      Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated again during the Napoleonic Wars  as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy  The US declared war  the War of       and invaded Canadian territory  In response Britain invaded the US  but the pre war boundaries were reaffirmed by the      Treaty of Ghent  ensuring Canada s future would be separate from that of the United States           Rise of the  Second  British Empire             edit  Exploration of the Pacific edit   James Cook s mission was to find the alleged southern continent Terra Australis  Since       transportation to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain  with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year      Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in       the British government turned to Australia      The coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch in           but there was no attempt to colonise it  In      James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage  claimed the continent for Britain  and named it New South Wales      In       Joseph Banks  Cook s botanist on the voyage  presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement  and in      the first shipment of convicts set sail  arriving in           Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until       to Tasmania until      and to Western Australia until           The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold      mainly because of gold rushes in Victoria  making its capital Melbourne for a time the richest city in the world     and the second largest city  after London  in the British Empire      During his voyage  Cook also visited New Zealand  known to Europeans due to the      voyage of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman  and claimed both the North and the South islands for the British crown in      and      respectively  Initially  interaction between the indigenous M ori population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods  European settlement increased through the early decades of the   th century  with numerous trading stations established  especially in the North  In       the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand  On   February       Captain William Hobson and around    Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi      This treaty is considered to be New Zealand s founding document      but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text     have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute       War with Napoleonic France edit  Main article  Napoleonic Wars  The Battle of Waterloo ended in the defeat of Napoleon and marked the beginning of Pax Britannica  Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon  in a struggle that  unlike previous wars  represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations      It was not only Britain s position on the world stage that was at risk  Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself  just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe      The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win  French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy  which won a decisive victory over a Franco Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in       Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied  including those of the Netherlands  which was annexed by Napoleon in       France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in           Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties  France ceded the Ionian Islands  Malta  which it had occupied in      and      respectively   Mauritius  Saint Lucia  Seychelles  and Tobago  Spain ceded Trinidad  the Netherlands Guyana  and the Cape Colony  Britain returned Guadeloupe  Martinique  French Guiana  and R union to France  and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands  while gaining control of Ceylon             and  Heligoland       Abolition of slavery edit  Main article  Abolitionism in the United Kingdom With the advent of the Industrial Revolution  goods produced by slavery became less important to the British economy      Added to this was the cost of suppressing regular slave rebellions  With support from the British abolitionist movement  Parliament enacted the Slave Trade Act in       which abolished the slave trade in the empire  In       Sierra Leone Colony was designated an official British colony for freed slaves      Parliamentary reform in      saw the influence of the West India Committee decline  The Slavery Abolition Act  passed the following year  abolished slavery in the British Empire on   August       finally bringing the Empire into line with the law in the UK  with the exception of the territories administered by the East India Company and Ceylon  where slavery was ended in        Under the Act  slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of four to six years of  apprenticeship       Facing further opposition from abolitionists  the apprenticeship system was abolished in           The British government compensated slave owners             Britain s imperial century             edit  See also

acquisition of Penang Island         Singapore        and Malacca         and the defeat of Burma              From its base in India  the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the     s  This trade  illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in       helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea  which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China       In       the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of        chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War  and resulted in the seizure by Britain of  Hong Kong Island  at that time a minor settlement  and other  Treaty Ports including  Shanghai       During the late   th and early   th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company  A series of Acts of Parliament were passed  including the Regulating Act of       Pitt s India Act of      and the Charter Act of      which regulated the Company s affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired       The Company s eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in       a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys  Indian troops under British officers and discipline       The rebellion took six months to suppress  with heavy loss of life on both sides  The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act       establishing the British Raj  where an appointed governor general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India       India became the empire s most valuable possession   the Jewel in the Crown   and was the most important source of Britain s strength       A series of serious crop failures in the late   th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over    million people died  The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule  Later  under direct British rule  commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies  which took until the early     s to have an effect        Rivalry with Russia edit  Main article  The Great Game  British

Qajar dynasty and Qing Dynasty  This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the  Great Game        As far as Britain was concerned  defeats inflicted by Russia on Persia and Turkey demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India       In       Britain moved to pre empt this by invading Afghanistan  but the First Anglo Afghan War was a disaster for Britain       When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in       fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities       The ensuing Crimean War              which involved new techniques of modern warfare       was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia       The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades  with Britain annexing Baluchistan in      and Russia annexing Kirghizia  Kazakhstan  and Turkmenistan  For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable  but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in      and on all outstanding matters in      with the signing of the Anglo Russian Entente       The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo Japanese War of           also limited its threat to the British        Cape to Cairo edit   The Rhodes Colossus Cecil Rhodes spanning  Cape to Cairo  The Dutch East India Company had founded the Cape Colony on the southern tip of Africa in      as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies  Britain formally acquired the colony  and its large Afrikaner  or Boer  population in       having occupied it in      to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign       British immigration began to rise after       and pushed thousands of Boers  resentful of British rule  northwards to found their own mostly short lived independent republics  during the Great Trek of the late     s and early     s       In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British  who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities  including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations  Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan  the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic                        and the Orange Free State                   In      Britain occupied both republics  concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War                   In      the Suez Canal opened under Napoleon III  linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean  Initially the Canal was opposed by the British       but once opened  its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the  jugular vein of the Empire        In       the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma il Pasha s     shareholding in the Suez Canal for    million  equivalent to      million in        Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway  it did give Britain leverage  Joint Anglo French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in             Although Britain controlled Egypt into the   th century  it was officially part of the Ottoman Empire and not part of the British Empire   The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position       but a compromise was reached with the      Convention of Constantinople  which made the Canal officially neutral territory       With competitive French  Belgian and Portuguese activity in the lower Congo River region undermining orderly colonisation of tropical Africa  the Berlin Conference of         was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the  Scramble for Africa  by defining  effective occupation  as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims       The scramble continued into the     s  and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in      to withdraw from Sudan  A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the Mahdist Army in       and rebuffed an attempted French invasion at Fashoda in       Sudan was nominally made an Anglo Egyptian condominium  but a British colony in reality       British gains in Southern and East Africa prompted Cecil Rhodes  pioneer of British expansion in Southern Africa  to urge a  Cape to Cairo  railway linking the strategically important Suez Canal to the mineral rich south of the continent       During the     s and     s  Rhodes  with his privately owned British South Africa Company  occupied and annexed territories named after him  Rhodesia        Changing status of the white colonies edit  The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the      Durham Report  which proposed unification and self government for Upper and Lower Canada  as a solution to political unrest which had erupted in armed rebellions in            This began with the passing of the Act of Union in       which created the Province of Canada  Responsible government was first granted to Nova Scotia in       and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies  With the passage of the British North America Act       by the British Parliament  the Province of Canada  New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into Canada  a confederation enjoying full self government with the exception of international relations       Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self government after       with the Australian colonies federating in            The term  dominion status  was officially introduced at the Colonial Conference of            The last decades of the   th century saw concerted political campaigns for Irish home rule  Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union      after the Irish Rebellion of       and had suffered a severe famine between      and       Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister  William Gladstone  who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada s footsteps as a Dominion within the empire  but his      Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament  Although the bill  if passed  would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation       many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break up of the empire       A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons       A third bill was passed by Parliament in       but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the      Easter Rising        World wars             edit   A poster urging men from countries of the British Empire to enlist By the turn of the   th century  fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the metropole and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of  splendid isolation        Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war  Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific      and threatened at home by the Imperial German Navy  Britain formed an alliance with Japan in      and with its old enemies France and Russia in      and       respectively        First World War edit  Main article  History of the United Kingdom during the First World War Britain s fears of war with Germany were realised in      with the outbreak of the First World War  Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany s overseas colonies in Africa  In the Pacific  Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and German Samoa respectively  Plans for a post war division of the Ottoman Empire  which had joined the war on Germany s side  were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the      Sykes Picot Agreement  This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca  who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers  giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state       The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions  which provided invaluable military  financial and material support  Over     million men served in the armies of the Dominions  as well as many thousands of volunteers from the Crown colonies       The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the      Gallipoli Campaign against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home  and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right  The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on Anzac Day  Canadians viewed the Battle of Vimy Ridge in a similar light       The important contribution of the Dominions to the war effort was recognised in      by the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an Imperial War Cabinet to co ordinate imperial policy       Under the terms of the concluding Treaty of Versailles signed in       the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of           square miles            km   and    million new subjects       The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates  Britain gained control of Palestine  Transjordan  Iraq  parts of Cameroon and Togoland  and Tanganyika  The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own  the Union of South Africa gained South West Africa  modern day Namibia   Australia gained New Guinea  and New Zealand Western Samoa  Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions         Inter war period edit   The British Empire at its territorial peak in      The changing world order that the war had brought about  in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers  and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland  caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy       Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan  Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the      Washington Naval Treaty  where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States       This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the     s      as militaristic governments took hold in Germany and Japan helped in part by the Great Depression  for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations       The issue of the empire s security was a serious concern in Britain  as it was vital to the British economy       In       the frustrations caused by delays to Irish home rule led the MPs of Sinn F in  a pro independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats in the      British general election  to establish an independent parliament in Dublin  at which Irish independence was declared  The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration       The Anglo Irish War ended in      with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo Irish Treaty  creating the Irish Free State  a Dominion within the British Empire  with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown       Northern Ireland  consisting of six of the    Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the      Government of Ireland Act  immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom         George V with British and Dominion prime ministers at the      Imperial Conference A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act      failed to satisfy demand for independence       Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar conspiracy ensured that war time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts  This led to tension       particularly in the Punjab region  where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre  In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre  between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy  and those who viewed it with revulsion       The Non Co Operation movement was called off in March      following the Chauri Chaura incident  and discontent continued to simmer for the next    years       In       Egypt  which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War  was granted formal independence  though it continued to be a British client state until       British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo Egyptian Treaty in            under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone  In return  Egypt was assisted in joining the League of Nations       Iraq  a British mandate since       also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in            In Palestine  Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews  The      Balfour Declaration  which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate  stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine  and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power       This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population  who openly revolted in       As the threat of war with Germany increased during the     s  Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland  and shifted to a pro Arab stance  limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency       The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy  independent of Britain  was recognised at the      Imperial Conference       Britain s request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa  and Canada had refused to be bound by the      Treaty of Lausanne            After pressure from the Irish Free State and South Africa  the      Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration of       declaring the Dominions to be  autonomous Communities within the British Empire  equal in status  in no way subordinate one to another  within a  British Commonwealth of Nations        This declaration was given legal substance under the      Statute of Westminster       The parliaments of Canada  Australia  New Zealand  the Union of South Africa  the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control  they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent       Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in       suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression       In      the Irish Free State introduced a republican constitution renaming itself Ireland        Second World War edit  Main article  British Empire in World War II  During the Second World War  the Eighth Army was made up of units from many different countries in the British Empire and Commonwealth  it fought in North African and Italian campaigns  Britain s declaration of war against Nazi Germany in September      included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia  Canada  New Zealand  Newfoundland and South Africa  All soon declared war on Germany  While Britain continued to regard Ireland as still within the British Commonwealth  Ireland chose to remain legally neutral throughout the war       After the Fall of France in June       Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany  until the German invasion of Greece on   April       British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin D  Roosevelt for military aid from the United States  but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war       In August       Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter  which included the statement that  the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live  should be respected  This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy  or the peoples colonised by European nations  and would later be interpreted differently by the British  Americans  and nationalist movements            For Churchill the entry of the United States into the war was the  greatest joy        He felt that Britain was now assured of victory       but failed to recognise that the  many disasters  immeasurable costs and tribulations  which he knew  lay ahead       in December      would have permanent consequences for the future of the empire  The manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain s standing and prestige as an imperial power            including  particularly  the Fall of Singapore  which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar       The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand  which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces  into closer ties with the United States and  ultimately  the      ANZUS Pact       The war weakened the empire in other ways  undermining Britain s control of politics in India  inflicting long term economic damage  and irrevocably changing geopolitics by pushing the Soviet Union and the United States to the centre of the global stage        Decolonisation and decline             edit   Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War  the effects of the conflict were profound  both at home and abroad  Much of Europe  a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries  was in ruins  and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union  who now held the balance of global power       Britain was left essentially bankrupt  with insolvency only averted in      after the negotiation of a  US      billion loan from the United States       the last instalment of which was repaid in            At the same time  anti colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations  The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union  In principle  both nations were opposed to European colonialism  In practice  American anti communism prevailed over anti imperialism  and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check       At first British politicians believed it would be possible to maintain Britain s role as a world power at the head of a re imagined Commonwealth       but by      they were forced to recognise that there was an irresistible  wind of change  blowing  Their priorities changed to maintaining an extensive zone of British influence      and ensuring that stable  non Communist governments were established in former colonies  In this context  while other European powers such as France and Portugal       waged costly and unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact  Britain generally adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies  In reality this was rarely peaceable or altruistic  Between      and       the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from     million to   million    million of whom were in Hong Kong        Initial disengagement edit   About      million people lost their homes as a result of the partition of India in       The pro decolonisation Labour government  elected at the      general election and led by Clement Attlee  moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire  Indian independence       India s two major political parties the Indian National Congress  led by Mahatma Gandhi  and the Muslim League  led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah  had been campaigning for independence for decades  but disagreed as to how it should be implemented  Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state  whereas the League  fearing domination by the Hindu majority  desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim majority regions  Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during      led Attlee to promise independence no later than    June       When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent  the newly appointed  and last  Viceroy  Lord Mountbatten  hastily brought forward the date to    August            The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan       Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa  and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives  Burma  which had been administered as part of the British Raj  and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in       India  Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth  while Burma chose not to join       The British mandate in Palestine  where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority  presented the British with a similar problem to that of India       The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the Holocaust  while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state  Frustrated by the intractability of the problem  attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence  Britain announced in      that it would withdraw in      and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve       The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state  It was immediately followed by the outbreak of a civil war between the Arabs and Jews of Palestine  and British forces withdrew amid the fighting  The British Mandate for Palestine officially terminated at midnight on    May      as the State of Israel declared independence and the      Arab Israeli War broke out  during which the territory of the former Mandate was partitioned between Israel and the surrounding Arab states  Amid the fighting  British forces continued to withdraw from Israel  with the last British troops departing from Haifa on    June            Following the surrender of Japan in the Second World War  anti Japanese resistance movements in Malaya turned their attention towards the British  who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony  valuing it as a source of rubber and tin       The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority  on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled  independence would be granted       The Malayan Emergency  as it was called  began in      and lasted until       but by       Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth  In       the    states of the federation together with Singapore  Sarawak and North Borneo joined to form Malaysia  but in      Chinese majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations and became an independent city state       Brunei  which had been a British protectorate since       declined to join the union        Suez and its aftermath edit  Main article  Suez Crisis  Eden s decision to invade Egypt in      revealed Britain s post war weaknesses  In       the Conservative Party returned to power in Britain  under the leadership of Winston Churchill  Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain s position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire  with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India  Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser s new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in       and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self determination by       with independence to follow       Sudan was granted independence on   January            In July       Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal  The response of Anthony Eden  who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister  was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal       Eden infuriated US President Dwight D  Eisenhower by his lack of consultation  and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion       Another of Eisenhower s concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side  Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency       Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives       UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces  and Eden resigned            The Suez Crisis very publicly exposed Britain s limitations to the world and confirmed Britain s decline on the world stage and its end as a first rate power            demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence  if not the full support  of the United States                 The events at Suez wounded British national pride  leading one MP to describe it as  Britain s Waterloo       and another to suggest that the country had become an  American satellite        Margaret Thatcher later described the mindset she believed had befallen Britain s political leaders after Suez where they  went from believing that Britain could do anything to an almost neurotic belief that Britain could do nothing   from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in            While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken  it did not collapse       Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region  intervening in Oman         Jordan        and Kuwait         though on these occasions with American approval       as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan s foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States       Although Britain granted Kuwait independence in       it continued to maintain a military presence in the Middle East for another decade  On    January       a few weeks after the devaluation of the pound  Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases East of Suez  which included the ones in the Middle East  and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore by the end of       instead of      as earlier planned       By that time over        British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East  including        in Singapore       The British granted independence to the Maldives in      but continued to station a garrison there until       withdrew from Aden in       and granted independence to Bahrain  Qatar  and the United Arab Emirates in             Wind of change edit  Main article  Decolonisation of Africa  British decolonisation in Africa  By the end of the     s  all but Rhodesia  the future Zimbabwe  and the South African mandate of South West Africa  Namibia  had achieved recognised independence  Macmillan gave a speech in Cape Town  South Africa in February      where he spoke of  the wind of change blowing through this continent        Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of colonial war that France was fighting in Algeria  and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly       To the three colonies that had been granted independence in the     s Sudan  the Gold Coast and Malaya were added nearly ten times that number during the     s       Britain s remaining colonies in Africa  except for self governing Southern Rhodesia  were all granted independence by       British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process  Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight year Mau Mau uprising  in which tens of thousands of suspected rebels were interned by the colonial government in detention camps       In Rhodesia  the      Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the white minority resulted in a civil war that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of       which set the terms for recognised independence in       as the new nation of Zimbabwe       In Cyprus  a guerrilla war waged by the Greek Cypriot organisation EOKA against British rule  was ended in      by the London and Z rich Agreements  which resulted in Cyprus being granted independence in       The UK retained the military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia as sovereign base areas  The Mediterranean colony of Malta was amicably granted independence from the UK in      and became the country of Malta  though the idea had been raised in      of integration with Britain       Most of the UK s Caribbean territories achieved independence after the departure in      and      of Jamaica and Trinidad from the West Indies Federation  established in      in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government  but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members       Jamaica attained independence in       as did Trinidad and Tobago  Barbados achieved independence in      and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands  including the Bahamas  in the     s and     s       but Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence       The British Virgin Islands       Cayman Islands and Montserrat also opted to retain ties with Britain       while Guyana achieved independence in       Britain s last colony on the American mainland  British Honduras  became a self governing colony in      and was renamed Belize in       achieving full independence in       A dispute with Guatemala over claims to Belize was left unresolved       British territories in the Pacific acquired independence in the     s beginning with Fiji in      and ending with Vanuatu in       Vanuatu s independence was delayed because of political conflict between English and French speaking communities  as the islands had been jointly administered as a condominium with France       Fiji  Papua New Guinea  Solomon Islands and Tuvalu became Commonwealth realms         End of empire edit  See also  Falklands War and Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong Belize achieved independence in            The passage of the British Nationality Act       which reclassified the remaining Crown colonies as  British Dependent Territories   renamed British Overseas Territories in                 meant that  aside from a scattering of islands and outposts  the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete  In       Britain s resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands  acting on a long standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire       Britain s successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing Falklands War contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain s status as a world power       The     s also saw Canada  Australia  and New Zealand sever their final constitutional links with Britain  Although granted legislative independence by the Statute of Westminster       vestigial constitutional links had remained in place  The British Parliament retained the power to amend key Canadian constitutional statutes  meaning that effectively an act of the British Parliament was required to make certain changes to the Canadian Constitution       The British Parliament also had the power to pass laws extending to Canada at Canadian request  Although no longer able to pass any laws that would apply as Australian Commonwealth law  the British Parliament retained the power to legislate for the individual Australian States  With regard to New Zealand  the British Parliament retained the power to pass legislation applying to New Zealand with the New Zealand Parliament s consent  In       the last legal link between Canada and Britain was severed by the Canada Act       which was passed by the British parliament  formally patriating the Canadian Constitution  The act ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution      Similarly  the Australia Act       effective   March       severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states  while New Zealand s Constitution Act       effective   January       reformed the constitution of New Zealand to sever its constitutional link with Britain       On   January       Brunei  Britain s last remaining Asian protectorate  was granted independence       Independence had been delayed due to the opposition of the Sultan  who had preferred British protection       In September      the Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher  travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government  on the future of Britain s last major and most populous overseas territory  Hong Kong       Under the terms of the      Treaty of Nanking and      Convention of Peking  Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula had been respectively ceded to

note    and in      they were renamed the British Overseas Territories       Most former British colonies and protectorates are members of the Commonwealth of Nations  a voluntary association of equal members  comprising a population of around     billion people       Sixteen Commonwealth realms voluntarily continue to share the British monarch  Queen Elizabeth II  as their head of state  These sixteen nations are distinct and equal legal entities   the United Kingdom  Australia  Canada  New Zealand  Antigua and Barbuda  The Bahamas  Barbados  Belize  Grenada  Jamaica  Papua New Guinea  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Saint Lucia  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Solomon Islands and Tuvalu       Decades  and in some cases centuries  of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire  The empire established the use of the English language in regions around the world  Today it is the primary language of up to     million people and is spoken by about     billion as a first  second or foreign language       Individual and team sports developed in Britain particularly football  cricket  lawn tennis  and golf were also exported       British missionaries who travelled around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread Protestantism  including Anglicanism  to all continents  The British Empire provided refuge for religiously persecuted continental Europeans for hundreds of years         Cricket being played in India  British sports continue to be supported in various parts of the former empire  Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions  contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas  The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples  Millions left the British Isles  with the founding settler populations of the United States  Canada  Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland  Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities  and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe  Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland  Millions of people moved to and from British colonies  with large numbers of Indians emigrating to other parts of the empire  such as Malaysia and Fiji  and Chinese people to Malaysia  Singapore and the Caribbean       The demographics of Britain itself were changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies       In the   th century  innovation in Britain led to revolutionary changes in manufacturing  the development of factory systems  growth of transportation by railway and steam ship  and communication by telegraph that spread around the world       British colonial architecture  such as in churches  railway stations and government buildings  can be seen in many cities that were once part of the British Empire       The British choice of system of measurement  the imperial system  continues to be used in some countries in various ways  The convention of driving on the left hand side of the road has been retained in much of the former empire       The Westminster system of parliamentary democracy has served as the template for the governments for many former colonies            and English common law for legal systems       International commercial contracts are often based on English common law            The British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific  citation needed
