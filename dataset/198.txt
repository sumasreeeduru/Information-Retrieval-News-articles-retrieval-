This subset of media ethics is known as journalism s professional  code of ethics  and the  canons of journalism      The basic codes and canons commonly appear in statements by professional journalism associations and individual print  broadcast  and online news organizations  While various codes may have some differences  most share common elements including the principles of truthfulness  accuracy  objectivity  impartiality  fairness  and public accountability  as these apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public              Like many broader ethical systems  the ethics  of journalism include the principle of  limitation of harm   This may involve the withholding of certain details from reports  such as the names of minor children  crime victims  names  or information not materially related to the news report where the release of such information might  for example  harm someone s reputation        Some journalistic codes of ethics  notably some European codes     also include a concern with discriminatory references in news based on race  religion  sexual orientation  and physical or mental disabilities                 The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe approved  in       Resolution      on the Ethics of Journalism  which recommends that journalists respect the

with  a history of the evolution  which is missing  You can help by adding to it   January       Journalism s codes of ethics are intended to ensure reliability of reported information by defining acceptable practices  and provide guidelines about circumstances to avoid that could interfere with  or appear to interfere with  the reliability of reported information  Circumstances to avoid include conflicts of interest  The guidelines assist journalists in identifying and dealing with ethical dilemmas  When such circumstances cannot be avoided  they should be disclosed so that recipients of reported information can judge potential bias in the reporting  The codes and canons provide journalists with a framework for self monitoring and self correction   Journalism is guided by five values   Honesty  journalists must be truthful  It is unacceptable to report information known to be false  or report facts in a misleading way to give a wrong impression  Independence and objectivity  journalists should avoid topics in which they have a financial or personal interest that would provide them a particular benefit in the subject matter  as that interest may introduce bias into their reporting  or give the impression of such bias  In cases where a journalist may have a specific financial or personal interest  the interest should be disclosed  Fairness  journalists must present facts with impartiality and neutrality  presenting other viewpoints and sides to a story where these exist  It is unacceptable to slant facts  Diligence  a journalist should gather and present pertinent facts to provide a good understanding of the subject reported  Accountability  a journalist must be accountable for their work  prepared to accept criticism and consequences      Codes of practice edit  While journalists in the United States and European countries have led the formulation and adoption of these standards  such codes can be found in news reporting organizations in most countries with freedom of the press  The written codes and practical standards vary somewhat from country to country and organization to organization  but there is substantial overlap between mainstream publications and societies  The International Federation of Journalists  IFJ  launched a global Ethical Journalism Initiative in      aimed at strengthening awareness of these issues within professional bodies  In      the Ethical Journalism Network was founded by former IFJ General Secretary Aidan White  This coalition of international and regional media associations and journalism support groups campaigns for ethics  good governance and self regulation across all platforms of media  One of the leading voices in the U S  on the subject of journalistic standards and ethics is the Society of Professional Journalists  The Preamble to its Code of Ethics states      public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy  The duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues  Conscientious journalists from all media and specialties strive to serve the public with thoroughness and honesty  Professional integrity is the cornerstone of a journalist s credibility  The Radio Television Digital News Association  an organization exclusively centered on electronic journalism  has  a code of ethics centering on public trust  truthfulness  fairness  integrity  independence  and accountability      The Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation   revealed a new Journalism Code of Practice designed to reflect the key standards and principles of modern journalism      The new Code of Practice is particularly notable for officially recognizing that journalism is no longer solely the preserve of the professional journalist       Common elements edit  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   January        Learn how and when to remove this template message  The primary themes common to most codes of journalistic standards and ethics are the following   Accuracy and standards for factual reporting edit  Reporters are expected to be as accurate as possible given the time allotted to story preparation and the space available and to seek reliable sources  Events with a single eyewitness are reported with attribution  Events with two or more independent eyewitnesses may be reported as fact  Controversial facts are reported with attribution  Independent fact checking by another employee of the publisher is desirable  Corrections are published when errors are discovered  These corrections are called corrigendum in newspapers  they feature after on the next issue published  Defendants at trial are treated only as having  allegedly  committed crimes  until conviction  when their crimes are generally reported as fact  unless  that is  there is serious controversy about wrongful conviction   Opinion surveys and statistical information deserve special treatment to communicate in precise terms any conclusions  to contextualize the results  and to specify accuracy  including estimated error and methodological criticism or flaws  Slander and libel considerations edit  Reporting the truth is almost never libel      which makes accuracy very important  Private persons have privacy rights that must be balanced against the public interest in reporting information about them  Public figures have fewer privacy rights in U S  law  where reporters are immune from a civil case if they have reported without malice  In Canada  there is no such immunity  reports on public figures must be backed by facts  Publishers vigorously defend libel lawsuits filed against their reporters  usually covered by libel insurance  Harm limitation principle edit  During the normal course of an assignment a reporter might go about gathering facts and details  conducting interviews  doing research and background checks  taking photos  and recording video and sound in search of justice  Harm limitation deals with the questions of whether everything learned should be reported and  if so  how  This principle of limitation means that some weight needs to be given to the negative consequences of full disclosure  creating a practical and ethical dilemma  The Society of Professional Journalists  code of ethics offers the following advice  which is representative of the practical ideas of most professional journalists  Quoting directly       Show compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage  Use special sensitivity when dealing with children and inexperienced sources or subjects  Be sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or grief  Recognise that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort  Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance  Recognise that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than do public officials and others who seek power  influence or attention  Only an overriding public need can justify intrusion into anyone s privacy  Show good taste  Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity  Be cautious about identifying juvenile suspects or victims of sex crimes  Be judicious about naming criminal suspects before the formal filing of charges  Balance a criminal suspect s fair trial rights with the public s right to be informed  Self regulation edit  In addition to codes of ethics  many news organizations maintain an in house ombudsman whose role is  in part  to keep news organizations honest and accountable to the public  The ombudsman is intended to mediate in conflicts stemming from internal or external pressures  to maintain accountability to the public for news reported  to foster self criticism  and to encourage adherence to both codified and uncodified ethics and standards  This position may be the same or similar to the public editor  though public editors also act as a liaison with readers and do not generally become members of the Organisation of News Ombudsmen  An alternative is a news council  an industry wide self regulation body  such as the Press Complaints Commission  set up by UK newspapers and magazines  Such a body is capable of applying fairly consistent standards and of dealing with a higher volume of complaints but may not escape criticisms of being toothless   Ethics and standards in practice edit  Main articles  journalism scandals  checkbook journalism  media bias  media ethics  and yellow journalism One of the most controversial issues in modern reporting is media bias  particularly on political issues  but also with regard to cultural and other issues  Another is the controversial issue of checkbook journalism  which is the practice of news reporters paying sources for their information  In the U S  it is generally considered unethical  with most mainstream newspapers and news shows having a policy forbidding it  While tabloid newspapers and tabloid television shows  which rely more on sensationalism  regularly engage in the practice  There are also some wider concerns  as the media continue to change  for example  that the brevity of news reports and use of soundbites has reduced fidelity to the truth  and may contribute to a lack of needed context for public understanding  From outside the profession  the rise of news management contributes to the real possibility that news media may be deliberately manipulated  Selective reporting  spiking  double standards  are very commonly alleged against newspapers  and by their nature are forms of bias not easy to establish  or guard against  This section does not address specifics of such matters  but issues of practical compliance  as well as differences between professional journalists on principles   Standards and reputation edit  Among the leading news organizations that voluntarily adopt and attempt to uphold the common standards of journalism ethics described herein  adherence and general quality vary considerably  The professionalism  reliability  and public accountability of a news organization are three of its most valuable assets  An organization earns and maintains a strong reputation in part through the consistent implementation of ethical standards  which influence its position with the public and within the industry   Genres  ethics  and standards

when to remove this template message  Advocacy journalists a term of some debate even within the field of journalism by definition tend to reject  objectivity   while at the same time maintaining many other common standards and ethics  Civic journalism adopts a modified approach to objectivity  instead of being uninvolved spectators  the press is active in facilitating and encouraging public debate and examining claims and issues critically   This does not necessarily imply advocacy of a specific political party or position  Creative nonfiction and literary journalism use the power of language and literary devices more akin to fiction to bring insight and depth into the often book length treatment of the subjects about which they write  Such devices as dialogue  metaphor  digression and other such techniques offer the reader insights not usually found in standard news reportage  However  authors in this branch of journalism still maintain ethical criteria such as factual and historical accuracy as found in standard news reporting  They venture outside the boundaries of standard news reporting in offering richly detailed accounts  One widely regarded author in the genre is Joyce Carol Oates  as with her book on boxer Mike Tyson  Investigative journalism often takes an implicit point of view on a particular public interest  by asking pointed questions and intensely probing certain questions   With outlets that otherwise strive for neutrality on political issues  the implied position is often uncontroversial for example  that political corruption or abuse of children is wrong and perpetrators should be exposed and punished  that government money should be spent efficiently  or that the health of the public or workers or veterans should be protected   Advocacy journalists often use investigative journalism in support of a particular political position  or to expose facts that are only concerning to those with certain political opinions   Regardless of whether or not it is undertaken for a specific political faction  this genre usually puts a strong emphasis on factual accuracy  because the point of an in depth investigation of an issue is to expose facts that spur change   Not all investigations seek to expose facts about a particular problem  some data driven reporting does deep analysis and presents interesting results for the general edification of the audience which might be interpreted in different ways or which may contain a wealth of facts concerned with many different potential problems  A factually constrained investigation with an implied public interest point of view may also find that the system under investigation is working well  New Journalism and Gonzo journalism also reject some of the fundamental ethical traditions and will set aside the technical standards of journalistic prose in order to express themselves and reach a particular audience or market segment   These favor a subjective perspective and emphasize immersive experiences over objective facts  Tabloid journalists are often accused of sacrificing accuracy and the personal privacy of their subjects in order to boost sales  The      News International phone hacking scandal is an example of this  Supermarket tabloids are often focused on entertainment rather than news  A few have  news  stories that are so outrageous that they are widely read for entertainment purposes  not for information  Some tabloids do purport to maintain common journalistic standards but may fall far short in practice  Others make no such claims  Some publications deliberately engage in satire  but give the publication the design elements of a newspaper  for example  The Onion  and it is not unheard of for other publications to offer the occasional  humorous articles appearing on April Fool s Day   Relationship with freedom of the press edit  In countries without freedom of the press  the majority of people who report the news may not follow the above described standards of journalism  Non free media are often prohibited from criticizing the national government  and in many cases are required to distribute propaganda as if it were news  Various other forms of censorship may restrict reporting on issues the government deems sensitive  In the United States  freedom of the press is protected under the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights  Under the First Amendment  the government is not allowed to censor the press  The government does not have the right to try to control what is published and cannot prevent certain things from being published by the press  Prior constraint is an attempt by the government to prevent the expression of ideas before they are published  Some countries that have freedom of the press are the U S   Canada  Western Europe and Scandinavia  Australia  New Zealand  Japan  Taiwan and a handful of countries in South America       Variations  violations  and controversies edit  There are a number of finer points of journalistic procedure that foster disagreements in principle and variation in practice among  mainstream  journalists in the free press  Laws concerning libel and slander vary from country to country  and local journalistic standards may be tailored to fit  For example  the United Kingdom has a broader definition of libel than does the United States  citation needed  Accuracy is important as a core value and to maintain credibility  but especially in broadcast media  audience share often gravitates toward outlets that are reporting new information first  Different organizations may balance speed and accuracy in different ways  The New York Times  for instance  tends to print longer  more detailed  less speculative  and more thoroughly verified pieces a day or two later than many other newspapers  citation needed     hour television news networks tend to place much more emphasis on getting the  scoop   Here  viewers may switch channels at a moment s notice  with fierce competition for ratings and a large amount of airtime to fill  fresh material is very valuable  Because of the fast turn around  reporters for these networks may be under considerable time pressure  which reduces their ability to verify information  Laws with regard to personal privacy  official secrets  and media disclosure of names and facts from criminal cases and civil lawsuits differ widely  and journalistic standards may vary accordingly  Different organizations may have different answers to questions about when it is journalistically acceptable to skirt  circumvent  or even break these regulations  Another example of differences surrounding harm reduction is the reporting of preliminary election results  In the United States  some news organizations feel that it is harmful to the democratic process to report exit poll results or preliminary returns while voting is still open  Such reports may influence people who vote later in the day  or who are in western time zones  in their decisions about how and whether or not to vote  There is also some concern that such preliminary results are often inaccurate and may be misleading to the public  Other outlets feel that this information is a vital part of the transparency of the election process  and see no harm  if not considerable benefit  in reporting it  Objectivity as a journalistic standard varies to some degree depending on the industry and country  For example  the government funded BBC in the United Kingdom places a strong emphasis on political neutrality  but British newspapers more often tend to adopt political affiliations or leanings in both coverage and audience  sometimes explicitly      In the United States  major newspapers usually explicitly claim objectivity as a goal in news coverage  though most have separate editorial boards that endorse specific candidates and publish opinions on specific issues  Adherence to a claimed standard of objectivity is a constant subject of debate  For example  mainstream national cable news channels in the United States claim political objectivity but to various degrees  Fox News has been accused of conservative bias and MSNBC accused of liberal bias  The degree to which these leanings influence cherry picking of facts  factual accuracy  the predominance of non news opinion and commentators  audience opinion of the issues and candidates covered  visual composition  tone and vocabulary of stories is hotly debated  News value is generally used to select stories for print  broadcast  blogs  and web portals  including those that focus on a specific topic  To a large degree  news value depends on the target audience  For example  a minor story in the United States is more likely to appear on CNN than a minor story in the Middle East which might be more likely to appear on Al Jazeera simply due to the geographic distribution of the channels  respective audiences  It is a matter of debate whether this means that either network is less than objective  and that controversy is even more complicated when considering coverage of political stories for different audiences that have different political demographics  as with Fox News vs  MSNBC   Some digital media platforms can use criteria to choose stories which are different than traditional news value  For example  while the Google News portal essentially chooses stories based on news value  though indirectly  through the choices of large numbers of independent outlets   users can set Google Alerts on specific terms which define personal subjective interests  Search engines  news aggregators  and social network feeds sometimes change the presentation of content depending on the consumer s expressed or inferred preferences or leanings  This has both been cheered as bypassing traditional  gatekeepers  and whatever biases they may have in favor of audience centric selection criteria  but criticized as creating a dangerous filter bubble which intentionally or unintentionally hides dissenting opinions and other content which might be important for the audience to see in order to avoid exposure bias and groupthink       Taste  decency  and acceptability edit  Audiences have different reactions to depictions of violence  nudity  coarse language  or to people in any other situation that is unacceptable to or stigmatized by the local culture or laws  such as the consumption of alcohol  homosexuality  illegal drug use  scatological images  etc    Even with similar audiences  different organizations and even individual reporters have different standards and practices  These decisions often revolve around what facts are necessary for the audience to know  When certain distasteful or shocking material is considered important to the story  there are a variety of common methods for mitigating negative audience reaction  Advance warning of explicit or disturbing material may allow listeners or readers to avoid content they would rather not be exposed to  Offensive words may be partially obscured or bleeped  Potentially offensive images may be blurred or narrowly cropped  Descriptions may be substituted for pictures  graphic detail might be omitted  Disturbing content might be moved from a cover to an inside page  or from daytime to late evening when children are less likely to be watching   There is often considerable controversy over these techniques  especially concern that obscuring or not reporting certain facts or details is self censorship that compromises objectivity and fidelity to the truth  and which does not serve the public interest  For example  images and graphic descriptions of war are often violent  bloody  shocking and profoundly tragic  This makes certain content disturbing to some audience members  but it is precisely these aspects of war that some consider to be the most important to convey  Some argue that  sanitizing  the depiction of war influences public opinion about the merits of continuing to fight  and about the policies or circumstances that precipitated the conflict  The amount of explicit violence and mutilation depicted in war coverage varies considerably from time to time  from organization to organization  and from country to country  Reporters have also been accused of indecency in the process of collecting news  namely that they are overly intrusive in the name of journalistic insensitivity  War correspondent Edward Behr recounts the story of a reporter during the Congo Crisis who walked into a crowd of Belgian evacuees and shouted   Anyone here been raped and speaks English         Campaigning in the media edit  Many print publications take advantage of their wide readership and print persuasive pieces in the form of unsigned editorials that represent the official position of the organization  Despite the ostensible separation between editorial writing and news gathering  this practice may cause some people to doubt the political objectivity of the publication s news reporting   Though usually unsigned editorials are accompanied by a diversity of signed opinions from other perspectives   Other publications and many broadcast media only publish opinion pieces that are attributed to a particular individual  who may be an in house analyst  or to an outside entity  One particularly controversial question is whether media organizations should endorse political candidates for office  Political endorsements create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting  and can create a perceived conflict of interest   Investigative methods edit  Investigative journalism is largely an information gathering exercise  looking for facts that are not easy to obtain by simple requests and searches  or are actively being concealed  suppressed or distorted  Where investigative work involves undercover journalism or use of whistleblowers  and even more if it resorts to covert methods more typical of private detectives or even spying  it brings a large extra burden on ethical standards  Anonymous sources are double edged they often provide especially newsworthy information  such as classified or confidential information about current events  information about a previously unreported scandal  or the perspective of a particular group that may fear retribution for expressing certain opinions in the press  The downside is that the condition of anonymity may make it difficult or impossible for the reporter to verify the source s statements  Sometimes news sources hide their identities from the public because their statements would otherwise quickly be discredited  Thus  statements attributed to anonymous sources may carry more weight with the public than they might if they were attributed  The Washington press has been criticized in recent years for excessive use of anonymous sources  in particular to report information that is later revealed to be unreliable  The use of anonymous sources increased markedly in the period before the      invasion of Iraq       Examples of ethical dilemmas edit  One of the primary functions of journalism ethics is to aid journalists in dealing with many ethical dilemmas they may encounter  From highly sensitive issues of national security to everyday questions such as accepting a dinner from a source  putting a bumper sticker on one s car  publishing a personal opinion blog  a journalist must make decisions taking into account things such as the public s right to know  potential threats  reprisals and intimidations of all kinds  personal integrity  conflicts between editors  reporters and publishers or management  and many other such conundra  The following are illustrations of some of those   The Pentagon Papers dealt with extremely difficult ethical dilemmas faced by journalists  Despite government intervention  The Washington Post  joined by The New York Times  felt the public interest was more compelling and both published reports  The cases went to the Supreme Court where they were merged and are known as New York Times Co  v  United States      U S           The Washington Post also once published a story about a listening device that the United States had installed over an undersea Soviet cable during the height of the cold war  The device allowed the United States to learn where Soviet submarines were positioned  In that case  Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee chose not to run the story on national security grounds  However  the Soviets subsequently discovered the device and  according to Bradlee   It was no longer a matter of national security  It was a matter of national embarrassment   However  the U S  government still wanted The Washington Post not to run the story on the basis of national security  yet  according to Bradlee   We ran the story  And you know what  the sun rose the next day       The Center for International Media Ethics  an international non profit organisation  offers platform for media professionals to follow current ethical dilemmas of the press  through its blog  Besides highlighting the ethical concerns of recent stories  journalists are encouraged to express their own opinion  The organisation  urges journalists to make their own judgments and identify their own strategies       The Ethics AdviceLine for Journalists  a joint venture  public service project of Chicago Headline Club Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and Loyola University Chicago s Center for Ethics and Social Justice  provides some examples of typical ethical dilemmas reported to their ethical dilemma hotline and are typical of the kinds of questions faced by many professional journalists  A partial listing of questions received by The Ethics AdviceLine       Is it ethical to make an appointment to interview an arsonist sought by police  without informing police in advance of the interview  Is lack of proper attribution plagiarism  Should a reporter write a story about a local priest who confessed to a sex crime if it will cost the newspaper readers and advertisers who are sympathetic to the priest  Is it ethical for a reporter to write a news piece on the same topic on which he or she has written an opinion piece in the same paper  Under what circumstances do you identify a person who was arrested as a relative of a public figure  such as a local sports star  Freelance journalists and photographers accept cash to write about  or take photos of  events with the promise of attempting to get their work on the AP or other news outlets  from which they also will be paid  Is that ethical  Can a journalist reveal a source of information after guaranteeing confidentiality if the source proves to be unreliable  Criticisms edit  Jesse Owen Hearns Branaman of the National Institute of Development Administration  Thailand  argued that journalistic professionalism is a combination of two factors  secondary socialization of journalists in the workplace and the fetishization of journalistic norms and standards      In this way  undesirable traits in new journalists can be weeded out  and remaining journalists are free to cynically criticize journalistic professional norms as long as they keep working and following them  This criticism is adapted from interviews of twenty political journalists from BBC News  Sky News  The Guardian  The New York Times  The Washington Post and MSNBC NBC News  and from philosopher Slavoj  i ek s concept of ideology       See also edit    Journalism portal Brown envelope journalism
