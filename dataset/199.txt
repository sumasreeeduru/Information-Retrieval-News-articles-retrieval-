was launched on    October       RT UK focuses on covering the United Kingdom  RT presenter Afshin Rattansi stated that the channel s position is  to challenge dominant power structures in Britain by broadcasting live and original programming with a progressive UK focus   and it is  not subject to the metropolitan elite s London bias  since its  news will come from right across the country      Richard Sambrook  former director of global news at the BBC and director of the Centre of Journalism at Cardiff University was quoted as saying  It s a surprising move to focus resources on the UK  It s not a commercial proposition  therefore the main purpose must be to gain influence  It s about soft power for the Kremlin      In a pre launch statement  RT correspondent Polly Boiko said  So much is made of how RT is funded  It s been cast as the Big Bad Wolf of the news media landscape   and  I think many of us    see the launch of RT UK as an opportunity to shake off the accusations levelled at the channel       Incidents edit  Relations with British regulators edit  Ahead of the launch of its UK specific broadcasts  RT said that adverts promoting the channel had been rejected by ad agencies because they felt they would be illegal under UK laws on political advertising  The network posted versions of the adverts on billboards and its website with the word  redacted  on them in an alleged protest  The UK Advertising Standards Authority said it had not banned the ads or even received any complaint about them     The UK broadcast regulator Ofcom had repeatedly reprimanded the international version of RT for its failure to remain impartial     London based RT International correspondent Sara Firth claims she had resigned the previous July after five years with the channel over its coverage of the MH   disaster  though it later had been found out that she was due to leave the channel anyway after a job offer at Arise TV     Shortly after the RT UK operation was launched  Ofcom said sanctions would be imposed if further breaches of the broadcasting code occurred      Threatened closure of banking facilities edit  In October       RT published a letter sent to  Russia Today TV UK Ltd  by NatWest bank informing the company that it intended to cease the banking facilities provided to it by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group  of which NatWest is a subsidiary        RT s editor in Moscow  Margarita Simonyan  tweeted in Russian   They closed our accounts in Britain  All of them   Decision not to be discussed   Long live freedom of speech   and Russian MPs  the foreign ministry and human rights officials all condemned the move      The Russian embassy in London described the move as an  openly political decision   however the British government  which since the      financial crisis has owned the majority of shares in the RBS group  denied being responsible for the bank s actions         NatWest subsequently said that it had written to one of RT s suppliers  not to the station itself  and that it would review the decision  RT itself said the company provides all RT services in the UK     The decision by NatWest RBS to end banking services was reversed in late January            Responses to coverage edit  Oliver Kamm wrote in The Times in October        For purportedly expert analysis of world events  RT turns to an assortment of racists  neo Nazis  UFO buffs       conspiracy theorists and obscure fantasists  Admittedly it s also been commended for balance and fairness   by the British National Party       He continued   This is not a normal news outlet but a conspiracy of fraudsters in the service of a murderous autocracy       In The Observer  Nick Cohen wrote in November      that the channel  feeds the huge western audience that wants to believe that human rights are a sham and democracy a fix  Believe that and you will ask  what right have we to criticise Putin  At least he is honest in his way       Matt Turner  writing for The Independent  pointed to marginalised issues and groups  like the disabled and the largest prison strike in US history  to which he asserted RT gave substantial coverage  unlike media in the UK and USA      Turner  who has  appeared on Russia Today  unpaid  as a political commentator   commented that  our own media biases have handed RT a large and disillusioned western audience to entice  In a balanced media landscape  they wouldn t have had this advantage to begin with        RT UK programming edit  Going Underground       present  with Afshin Rattansi         Keiser Report       present
