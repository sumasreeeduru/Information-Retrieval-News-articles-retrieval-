of deliberately mentioning or showing a product or brand  often in exchange for compensation  A Rolls Royce Silver Shadow car that was used in the James Bond spy thriller film The World Is Not Enough Product placement  also known as embedded marketing              is a marketing technique where references to specific brands or products are incorporated into another work  such as a film or television program  with specific promotional intent  While references to brands  real or fictional  may be voluntarily incorporated into works to maintain a feeling of realism or be a subject of commentary     product placement is the deliberate incorporation of references to a brand or product in exchange for compensation  Product placements may range from unobtrusive appearances within an environment  to prominent integration and acknowledgement of the product within the work  Common categories of products used for placements include automobiles and consumer electronics     Works produced by vertically integrated companies  such as Sony  may use placements to promote their other divisions as a form of corporate synergy  During the   st century  the use of product placement on television has grown  particularly to combat the wider use of digital video recorders that can skip traditional commercial breaks  as well as to engage with younger demographics     Digital editing  technology is also being used to tailor product placement to specific demographics or markets  and in some cases  add placements to works that did not originally have embedded advertising  or update

Folies Berg re by  douard Manet may be an early example of product placement  The distinctive label and shape of two bottles allow them to be identified as Bass beer Product placement began in the   th century  By the time Jules Verne published the adventure novel Around the World in Eighty Days         his fame had led transport and shipping companies to lobby to be mentioned in the story  Whether Verne was actually paid to do so remains unknown     Similarly  a painting by Edouard Manet             shows a bar at the Folies Bergere with distinctive bottles placed at either end of the counter  The beer bottle is immediately recognisable as Bass beer  Manet s motivations for including branded products in his painting are unknown  it may be that it simply added to the work s authenticity  but on the other hand the artist may have received some payment in return for its inclusion     Research reported by Jean Marc Lehu        suggests that films produced by Auguste and Louis Lumi re in      were made at the request of a representative of Lever Brothers in France  The films feature Sunlight soap  which may be the first recorded instance of paid product placement in film      This led to cinema becoming one of the earliest channels used for product placement    Self advertising  A German countess holds a copy of the magazine Die Woche in her hands  The photo appeared in      in an issue of the magazine   detail of the actual photograph  With the arrival of photo rich periodicals in the late   th century  publishers found ways of lifting their paper s reputation by placing an actual copy of the magazine in photographs of prominent people  For example  the German magazine Die Woche in      printed an article about a countess in her castle where she  in one of the photographs  holds a copy of the magazine in her hands      Product placement was a common feature of many of the earliest actualities and cinematic attractions from the first ten years of cinema history      During the next four decades  Harrison s Reports frequently cited cases of on screen brand name products      Harrison condemned the practice as harmful to movie theatres  and his editorials reflected his hostility towards product placement in films  Harrison s Reports published its first denunciation of that practice over Red Crown gasoline s appearance in The Garage             Another editorial criticised the collaboration between the Corona Typewriter company and First National Pictures when a Corona typewriter appeared in several films in the mid     s including The Lost World             Recognisable brand names appeared in movies from cinema s earliest history  Before films were even narrative forms in the sense that they are recognized today  industrial concerns funded the making of what film scholar Tom Gunning described as  cinematic attractions       short films of one or two minutes  In the first decade or so of film             audiences attended films as  fairground attractions  interesting for their then amazing visual effects  This format was better suited to product placement than narrative cinema  Leon Gurevitch argued that early cinematic attractions have more in common with television advertisements in the     s than they do with traditional films      Gurevitch suggested that as a result  the relationship between cinema and advertising is intertwined  suggesting that cinema was in part the result of advertising and the economic advantage that it provided early film makers      Segrave detailed the industries that advertised in these early films       Movies and television edit  Early film edit  A feature film that has expectations of reaching millions of viewers attracts marketers      In many cases no payment is made for product exposure and no promise of marketing support is made when consumer brands appear in movies  citation needed  Film productions need props for scenes  so each movie s property master  who is responsible for gathering props for the film  contacts product placement middlemen agencies or product companies directly  In addition to items for on screen use  the product or service supplier might provide a production with large quantities of complimentary products or services  Tapping product placement channels can be particularly valuable for movies when a vintage product is required such as a sign or bottle that is not readily available  Although there is no definitive proof that product placement for Red Crown gasoline in The Garage  Fritz Lang s Dr  Mabuse the Gambler        contained a prominent title card in the opening credits reading  The gowns of the female stars were designed by Vally Reinecke and made in the fashion studios of Flatow Sch dler und Mossner   Among notable silent films to feature product placement was Wings         the first to win the Academy Award for Best Picture  It contained a plug for Hershey s chocolate  Fritz Lang s film M  released in       shows a banner display for Wrigley s PK Chewing Gum  for approximately       seconds  Another early example occurs in Horse Feathers         where Thelma Todd s character falls out of a canoe and into a river  She calls for a  life saver  and Groucho Marx tosses her a Life Savers candy  It s a Wonderful Life        depicts a young boy with aspirations to be an explorer  displaying a prominent copy of National Geographic magazine  In Love Happy         Harpo cavorts on a rooftop among various billboards and at one point escapes from the villains on the old Mobil logo  the  Flying Red Horse   Harrison s Reports severely criticised this scene in its film review     and in a front page editorial  In Gun Crazy         the climactic crime is the payroll robbery of the Armour meat packing plant  where a Bulova clock is prominently displayed   Later films edit   A DMC DeLorean car was used in Back to the Future III  The James Bond film You Only Live Twice        featured the Toyota     GT  and the films Smokey and the Bandit        and The Cannonball Run        film series featured conspicuous placements  The science fiction film E T  the Extra Terrestrial        is often cited for its multiple  obvious placements  including the incorporation of the candy Reese s Pieces into the plot          In the New World Pictures dub of The Return of Godzilla  Godzilla       Dr  Pepper is subject to prominent product placement in the new scenes shot specifically for the dub  In a scene shot at an American military base  a vending machine is situated directly between two characters  and in similar scenes characters are often shown drinking the soft drink  Cheerios and Coca Cola had product placement in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Evita  in Superman  The Movie and the sequel Superman II  Clark Kent eats Cheerios for breakfast in Smallville  In Superman II s climax  Superman crashes into a giant Coca Cola advertisement and saves people on a bus bearing an ad for Evita  before he smashes into a Marlboro delivery truck  A prominent example of product placement comes in the film Cast Away in which Tom Hanks  the lead character  is a FedEx employee  A volleyball from Wilson Sporting Goods is also prominently featured in the film      References to the delivery company FedEx are made throughout the film  and the company is central to the plot  The Internship         which features two unemployed slacker friends seeking employment at Google  was described by Tom Brook of the BBC as  one huge advertisement for Google  that took  product placement to a startling new extreme       Rolling Stone magazine included it on a list of the    Egregious Product Placements in film       Early television edit  In other early media  e g   radio in the     s and     s and television in the     s  programs were often underwritten by companies  Soap operas were so named because they were initially underwritten by consumer packaged goods companies such as Procter   Gamble or Unilever  When television began to displace radio  DuMont s Cavalcade of Stars television show was  in its era  notable for not relying on a sole sponsor  Sponsorship continues with programs being sponsored by major vendors such as Hallmark Cards  The conspicuous display of Studebaker motor vehicles in the television series Mr  Ed              which was sponsored by the Studebaker Corporation from      to       as well as the display of Ford vehicles on the series Hazel              which was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company from      to       are notable examples of television product placement   Types edit  Placements fall into two categories  paid and unpaid  Subcategories are basic  when a logo is merely visible  and advanced  whereby the product or brand is spoken by characters in the show or movie  Barter and service deals  mobile phones provided for crew use  for instance  are also common practices  Content providers may trade product placements for help funding advertisements tied in with a film s release  a show s new season or other event      Still another variant  known as an advertisement placement  displays an advertisement for the product  rather than the product itself  appears in the production  such as a Lucky Strike cigarette advertisement on a billboard or a truck with a milk ad on its trailer   Re placement edit  Placing contemporary products into existing content creates new opportunities for marketers      These can be during reruns or video release           An early example of product replacement is the      Sylvester Stallone action film Demolition Man  The film includes a plot point that in the future world of       Taco Bell is the only remaining restaurant franchise      Since Taco Bell was not well known outside of the U S   for the international release of the film it was replaced with Pizza Hut another restaurant chain owned by Yum  Brands  Lines were re dubbed and logos changed during post production      In television examples include Numb rs and Still Standing  where a scene may be shot originally with a blank table  with sponsored products digitally added  possibly for each airing      As of       dynamic or switchable placements became possible  Placements can be customised based upon factors such as demographics  psychographics or behavioral information about the consumer  In game advertising vendors such as Massive Incorporated transmit user information such as individual player IDs and data about what was on the screen and for how long to their servers  enabling user specific placements      Hypervideo techniques allow the insertion of interactive elements into video   Brand integration edit  Brand integration  a variant of product placement  is when  the product or company name becomes part of the show in such a way that it contributes to the narrative and creates an environment of brand awareness beyond that produced by advanced placement       While this type of advertising is common on unscripted shows such as The Apprentice  it can also be used in scripted television      An early example was by Abercrombie   Fitch  when one of its stores provided the notional venue for part of the romantic comedy film Man s Favorite Sport          On All My Children one character took a job at Revlon      The character s job became part of the character s development      Jurassic Park not only prominently features Ford cars and other commercial products  but also includes a scene displaying its own promotional merchandise  One shot shows the  Jurassic Park Souvenir Store   with products that it offered for sale to fans   Product displacement edit  Main article  product displacement  Aspen beer  a fictional brand from the      film Alien A real brand logo may be hidden or replaced with fictional brand names in a production  either to imitate  satirize or differentiate the product from a real corporate brand      Such a device may be required where real corporations are unwilling to license their brand names for use in the fictional work  particularly where the work holds the product in a negative light      According to Danny Boyle  director of the film Slumdog Millionaire         the makers used  product displacement  to accommodate sponsors such as Mercedes Benz that refused to allow their products to be used in non flattering settings  While Mercedes did not mind having a gangster driving their cars  they objected to their products being shown in a slum  The makers removed logos digitally in post production  costing  tens of thousands of pounds   When such issues are brought up in advance of filming  production companies often resort to  greeking   the practice of simply covering logos with tape  but one of them driven by Latika is shown to have the logos on the car keys  Similarly  in The Blues Brothers         portions of the defunct Dixie Square Mall in Harvey  Illinois  were reconstructed in fa ade and used as the scene of an indoor car chase  Signage belonging to mall tenants was replaced with that of other vendors  for instance  a Walgreens would become a Toys  R  Us      Cars        parodies NASCAR  an advertising heavy sport which controversially had long allowed alcohol and tobacco sponsorships  NASCAR s sponsors were replaced with fictional or parody brands  Dinoco Oil takes pride of place  followed by a string of invented automotive aftermarket products marketed in a similar means to pharmaceutical products   Dale Earnhardt Inc   displaced  Junior     s sponsor Budweiser to avoid advertising beer in a Disney   Pixar feature  The racing series portrayed in the film is also known as the  Piston Cup   as a pun on the NASCAR Cup Series  past sponsor of Winston cigarettes  during which time it was known as the  Winston Cup Series   it has since been succeeded by phone carrier Sprint and energy drink Monster Energy            Audio vs visual edit  Placements can be sound only  visual only or a combination of both  The Russian television show        phonetically Dom     similar to Big Brother  often features participants stating something along the lines of   Oh  did you check out the new product X by company Y yet   after which the camera zooms in on the named product  explicitly combining an audio mention with a visual image  In The Real World Road Rules Challenge participants often make a similar comment  usually pertaining to the mobile device and carrier for a text message  An experiment from      tested the relationship between auditory vs visual product placement and if the product had higher or lower connection to the plot to how well it was remembered by viewers  The results of the experiment concluded that regardless of if the product had higher or lower connection to the plot  in either circumstance an auditory product placement was more likely to be remembered by viewers than a visual product placement       Branded content edit  Main article  branded content  Branded content  refers to works that are funded or produced by an advertiser as a vehicle for their brand  Some forms of branded content do include self placed product placement  such as a series of made for TV movies produced by Walmart and Procter   Gamble  which featured placements for P G products and Walmart store brands               but some  such as  most prominently  the media operations of Red Bull  are focused more upon producing content that is consistent with the brand s values and demographics  rather than being a promotion for their products  in this case  energy drinks  first and foremost               Cross promotion edit  Larger  vertically integrated conglomerates may include references to their own products and services in works as a form of corporate synergy  Owing to its common ownership  Sony Pictures films have featured placements of Sony s consumer electronics products  particularly Xperia smartphones  among other products  The James Bond films Skyfall and Spectre prominently feature placements of the Xperia T and Z  smartphones respectively  and the T was distributed with pre loaded add on content relating to Skyfall and the film franchise                  Similarly  it is not uncommon for films produced by media conglomerates to include portrayals of programming from their respective television channels in universe  such as some   th Century Fox films incorporating the then co owned Fox News Channel into scenes portraying newscasts       Parodies edit  The pilot episode of the NBC sitcom    Rock featured the General Electric  at the time an     owner of NBC  Trivection oven      but was said to be a joke by the show s creator      The show later parodied placement      The      film Return of the Killer Tomatoes mocked the concept when at one point the film stops for lack of money  The character played by George Clooney suggests product placement as a way to continue  This was followed by several scenes with blatant product placement  including a Pepsi billboard installed in front of the villain s mansion  The      film The Making of     And God Spoke  is a mockumentary about the filming of a biblical epic  When running low on funds to complete the film within a film  the desperate producers resort to product placement  resulting in the absurd anachronism of Moses descending from Mt  Sinai carrying the Ten Commandments and a six pack of Coca Cola  The film Fight Club  directed by David Fincher  bit the hand that fed it by depicting acts of violence against most of the products that paid to be placed in the film      Examples include the scene where the Apple Store is broken into  the scene where Brad Pitt and Edward Norton smash the headlights of a new Volkswagen Beetle  and try to blow up a  popular coffee franchise   a thinly veiled dig at Starbucks  The film Superstar  starring Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon  shows every resident in town driving Volkswagen New Beetles  possibly for comic effect  Similarly  the film Mr  Deeds shows Adam Sandler s character purchasing a Chevrolet Corvette for every resident of his town  The      Will Ferrell comedy film Talladega Nights  The Ballad of Ricky Bobby parodied the large amount of sponsorship in NASCAR  having the title character at one point drive with a  dangerous and inconvenient  decal of the Fig Newtons logo on his windshield as an additional vehicle sponsor  which obstructs his vision  He is also seen bluntly serving as a spokesperson for Big Red chewing gum      Wayne s World featured a scene where Wayne refuses to allow his show s sponsor to appear on the air  When told it is part of his contract  Wayne argues that the deal  didn t include selling out  while conspicuously drinking a can of Pepsi  eating Doritos  and displaying a Pizza Hut pizza  Garth then laments that  people only do things because they get paid  while his entire wardrobe consists of Reebok athletic wear  Finally  Wayne complains of a headache and Garth advises him to take Nuprin while cutting to a few seconds of a Nuprin TV ad          Kung Pow  Enter the Fist spoofed its product placements  highlighting the anachronistic inclusion of a Taco Bell  In a similar vein  in Looney Tunes  Back In Action  the main characters stumble across a Wal Mart while stranded in the middle of Death Valley and acquire supplies just for providing an endorsement  Kannagi  Crazy Shrine Maidens poked fun at its sponsor Sony by having one character give another a Blu ray Disc with the tagline  It s a Sony   only for them to complain that they do not have a Blu ray player  to which the character responds with a version in Betamax   Faux placements edit  Further information  Fictional brands Some films do not wish to depict real brands onscreen  so fake brands are created for products shown onscreen   X Files              as well as many other films and television productions  featured the fictional Morley brand of cigarettes  the choice of the Cigarette Smoking Man      The company producing Morleys was also involved in a cover up conspiracy  Brand X  Ghostbusters had a faux product in the climax of the film when the team faces the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man  Previously in the film  Stay Puft brand marshmallows     are shown in Dana s apartment and a Stay Puft billboard is visible  via a matte painting  when the Ghostbusters  storage grid is deactivated and the imprisoned ghosts are released  Similar in form  Mel Brooks used the same device in the comedy spoof Spaceballs  which parodied Star Wars  in one scene  he opened up a can of Perri Air canned air  a play on the name Perrier  the brand of fresh spring water      The Truman Show used fake placements to advance the narrative of the reality television set  Truman s wife places products in front of hidden cameras  even naming them in dialogue with her husband  This increases Truman s suspicions as he comes to realize his surroundings are intentionally fabricated      Some filmmakers created fictional products that appear in multiple movies  citation needed  Examples include Kevin Smith  Nails Cigarettes  Mooby Corporation  Chewlees Gum  Discreeto Burritos  and Quentin Tarantino  Red Apple Cigarettes  Jack Rabbit Slim s Restaurants  Big Kahuna Burger       This went even further with the fictional brand Binford Tools which appeared in TV shows Home Improvement and Last Man Standing and in the Toy Story movie franchise  all starring Tim Allen  This practice is also fairly common in certain comics  such as Svetlana Chmakova s Dramacon  which makes several product placement esque usages of  Pawky    a modification of the name of the Japanese snack  Pocky   popular among anime and manga fans  or Naoko Takeuchi s Sailor Moon  which includes numerous references to the series Codename  Sailor V  from which Sailor Moon was spun off  This practice is also common in certain  reality based  video games such as the Grand Theft Auto series  which feature fictitious stores such as Ammu Nation      Vinyl Countdown  Gash  spoofing Gap  Zip  Pizza Boy  etc   Reverse placement edit  So called  reverse product placement  creates real products to match those seen in a fictional setting  typically as a tie in      Willy Wonka   the Chocolate Factory        led to a real Willy Wonka candy company  established soon after the film s release      In       Crazy Eddie was created as a fictional car dealer in the film A Letter to Three Wives      That name  bestowed in      upon a real life electronics chain in New York City  appeared in      in an ad in Splash  Crazy Eddie s memorable ads are parodied in Howard the Duck  featuring a duck version of the famous pitchman  and UHF  as  Crazy Ernie   a used car salesman  threatens to club a baby seal if nobody comes in to buy a car  In       as a promotional tie in for The Simpsons Movie    Eleven temporarily turned twelve of its locations into Kwik E Marts a fictional chain of convenience stores within the universe of The Simpsons  The stores sold real world versions of food and drink brands seen in the franchise  including Buzz Cola  Duff Beer and Krusty O s       Music and recording industries edit  While radio and television stations are regulated by national governments  producers of printed or recorded works are not  leading marketers to attempt to get products mentioned in lyrics of popular songs  In       The Kluger Agency was claimed     to have proposed placement of Double Happiness Jeans      a virtual sweatshop created as part of the Invisible Threads project for the      Sundance Festival  in a Pussycat Dolls song for a fee      The firm was not intended to represent a commercial product  It had been invented as a collaboration between Jeff Crouse of the Anti Advertising Agency and Stephanie Rothenberg  While the product technically existed at the time  Double Happiness was intended to be a critical piece      In January       Migra Corridos  a five song EP including accordion ballad  El Mas Grande Enemigo   had received airplay on twenty five Mexican radio stations  The tune purports to be the lament of a would be immigrant left to die in the Arizona desert by coyotes  people smugglers       No disclosure was made to the radio stations that the U S  Border Patrol had commissioned the project with content devised by Elevaci n  a Hispanic advertising agency based in Washington  D C  and New York City      In       a video for Lady Gaga s  Telephone  was panned by critics for

Natasha Bedingfield s  Touch   Flo Rida and Akon s  Available   Jason Derulo s  Ridin  Solo       and  OH   s  Double Vision       In       Britney Spears s music video for  Hold It Against Me

advertisement for the Fiat     Cabrio in           The original video also advertised BlackBerry  Tous  Planet Love Match and Crown Royal      Alcohol advertising in music videos drew criticism from Curtin University in Perth  Australia in       An Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code  ABAC  exists in Australia to handle complaints      but a placement of Midori liqueur in Cobra Starship s  You Make Me Feel     was judged not to be alcohol advertising      Rap and hip hop are notorious for the high level of product placement in lyrics and music videos  as rappers flaunt luxury brands to show off their wealthy lifestyle  companies pay to have their products named in tracks      This integration began in      with Run DMC s  My Adidas   Hennessy and Aliz  are notable as alcoholic drinks which became popular after being promoted in rap           Comics edit  South African football comic book Supa Strikas accepts product placement to allow for the comic s free distribution  Product

National Roads Agency  among others      Other titles adopted the same system  including cricket comic Supa Tigers and Strike Zone   Sports edit  Product placement has long been prevalent in sports at all levels   NFL edit  While now defunct NFL Europe allowed liberal use of team uniforms by sponsors  the main National Football League  NFL  does not  For instance  the league prohibits logos of sponsors painted onto the fields  although Gillette Stadium in Foxborough  Massachusetts  has their stadium s logomark painted onto the FieldTurf field  In       the league allowed sponsors on the practice jerseys of the uniforms  but not game uniforms  In       the league allowed uniform suppliers to display their logos on their NFL related products  Since       Nike has been the league s official uniform supplier      Early on  two of the league s flagship teams the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers adopted their identity from corporate sponsors  The Packers adopted the name  Packers  because they were sponsored by the Indian Packing Company  They later had  ACME PACKERS  written on their uniforms in the early     s after the Acme Packing Company bought Indian Packing      The Steelers adopted their current logo in      as a product placement deal with the American Iron and Steel Institute  which owned the rights to the Steelmark logo  The Steelers later

companies in the Pittsburgh area   The league has placed itself  NFL Japan was a sponsor of the football themed anime series Eyeshield          Auto racing edit  In auto racing  the concept of the factory backed contestant  who is provided with vehicles and technical support in return for the car s manufacturer obtaining visibility for its products in competition  dates in NASCAR to the     s and Marshall Teague s factory backed Fabulous Hudson Hornet   Win on Sunday  sell on Monday  was once a common adage among automakers      In Formula One  a number of major racing teams were once sponsored by tobacco companies  including Marlboro  which has had tenures with Ferrari and the McLaren team  Due to tightening regulations on tobacco advertising worldwide  many of these sponsorships have either been dropped  or downplayed and replaced with subliminal versions on vehicle livery when races are held in regions with heavy restrictions or outright bans on the marketing of cigarettes  such as the European Union            Notable placements edit  Automobiles  apparel  beverages  home goods  furniture  consumer electronics  computers  restaurants  financial institutions  travel  airlines and websites are just a few of the product categories  FedEx provided vehicles  access  and logistical support for the making of Cast Away  The movie depicted real FedEx locations  and the company s CEO appeared in one scene       Automobiles edit  The most common products to be promoted in this way are automobiles  Frequently  all the important vehicles in a film or television series are supplied by one manufacturer  The James Bond film franchise has been well known for featuring product placements for various vehicles  particularly luxury and sports cars  Aston Martin has been the most synonymous with the franchise  dating back to the appearance of the Aston Martin DB  as Bond s vehicle in Goldfinger                 Cars        portrays a mix of real and fictional vehicles

worth       billion       has been featured in films such as the Fast and the Furious      The Martian     Jump Street  and Fantastic Four to name a few        Consumer electronics and computers edit  Apple s products frequently appear in films  music videos and on television  Apple has stated that they do not pay for this  but declined to discuss how its products are placed  some Apple placements may have stemmed from their products  ubiquity and position as a status symbol rather than actual paid promotion       Similarly  Pixar films have often included references to Apple products  although this is an homage to Apple co founder Steve Jobs having been an early investor in the studio       The      Modern Family episode  Game Changer  prominently featured the iPad and aired prior to its launch  while the      episode  Connection Lost  was presented entirely from the perspective of Claire Dunphy s Macbook laptop  who interacted with other characters via FaceTime video calls and iMessage  while also using other Mac OS X applications  Show creator Steven Levitan said the show had an ongoing relationship with Apple  but did not elaborate further  In the case of the former  while the episode s credits did state that the iPad was  provided  by Apple  the company did not pay the show s broadcaster ABC for the integration  nor buy any commercial time during the episode  Similarly  Apple did not provide any financial compensation for  Connection Lost   but did provide MacBook Pro and iPhone hardware for the filming  and a Mac Pro workstation for post production            In video games  the most common placements are for processors or graphics cards  For example  in EA s Battlefield       ads for Intel Core   processors appear on map billboards  EA s The Sims contains in game advertising for Intel and for McDonald s  Rare s Perfect Dark Zero features many ads for Samsung in their menus        Food and beverage edit  The use of Reese s Pieces as a prominent plot element in the film E T  the Extra Terrestrial was the result of a sponsorship deal  it was originally intended for the titular character s favorite food to be M Ms candies  but Mars  Incorporated turned down an offer  believing the film s alien would scare children  The Hershey Company took the sponsorship instead  which included the rights for the company to cross promote Reese s Pieces with the film  The deal was considered a major coup for the company  sales of Reese s Pieces tripled  and some retailers had trouble meeting demand for the product          Alongside criticism for trying to ride off the popularity of E T   the film Mac and Me was widely criticised for containing numerous placements for Coca Cola soft drinks and the fast food chain McDonald s  both brands are integral to the film s plot  while McDonald s mascot Ronald McDonald makes an appearance during a dance scene set at a McDonald s  and is credited as appearing in the film  as himself   Critics also noted that the name of the alien creature featured in the film   Mac   could also be interpreted as a reference to the chain s notable burger  the Big Mac                 Its producer R J  Louis denied that the film was funded by McDonald s  he had previously worked on campaigns for the company and wanted to make a film that would help benefit the Ronald McDonald House Charities  and had to pursue rights to portray the McDonald s brand in the film  noting that he was  still the only person in the universe that ever had the exclusive motion picture rights to the McDonald s trademark  their actors  their characters  and the whole company    but did receive funding from one of the chain s major suppliers  Golden State Foods  He also justified the extended dance scene  as trips to McDonald s were often seen as a  treat  for children of the era  and explained that  Mac  was meant to be an acronym for  Mysterious Alien Creature        The James Bond series has also prominently featured placements for liquor  tied to the character s recurring affinity for martinis  particularly  vespers   although Skyfall deviated from this tradition by entering into a promotional deal with Dutch brewery Heineken  which also allowed the company to feature Bond actor Daniel Craig in an accompanying ad campaign             Tobacco edit  Tobacco companies have made direct payment to stars for using their cigarettes in films  Sylvester Stallone received US         to use Brown and Williamson tobacco products in five feature films                 In response to a Christian Science Monitor article      accusing the industry of deliberately using product placement as an advertising strategy  the Tobacco Institute claimed that product placement is driven by filmmakers to  achieve desired artistic effects but also to offset production costs   It also claimed  the      federal ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio does not prohibit payments to filmmakers for the use of cigarettes in a film   The rebuttal concludes with the sentiment that smoking in film provides a certain  aesthetic  which is legitimate and at the filmmaker s discretion        Airlines edit  Many airlines have advertised prominently in film  in some cases to promote a new flight route or just to increase public awareness of the company  Pan Am advertised in many films  including       A Space Odyssey      and James Bond films  American Airlines was advertised in Home Alone and Home Alone    and a model of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing     was shown in Wayne s World  Mike Myers  later film  Austin Powers  The Spy Who Shagged Me  featured a major promotion with Virgin  including repainting some of Virgin s fleet to read  Virgin Shaglantic        American Airlines and Hilton Hotels were featured in the film Up in the Air  George Clooney  an avid flyer is constantly seen in the airport because of his career  This film was a huge endorsement for American Airlines  yet no payment was exchanged between the filmmaker and the airline       Turkish Airlines was featured in the film Batman v Superman  Warner Bros and Turkish Airlines signed a contract together to help promote and endorse the film        Radio  television and publishing edit  Television edit  The list of television shows with the most instances of product placement  November              according to Nielsen Media Research  included    The Biggest Loser         American Idol         Extreme Makeover  Home Edition         America s Toughest Jobs         One Tree Hill         Deal or No Deal         America s Next Top Model         Last Comic Standing         Kitchen Nightmares         Hell s Kitchen         Glenn Martin  DDS M M s  Mrs  Butterworth  etc   Nielsen called a scene in an episode of CBS  Mike   Molly of Mike eating M M s in Carl s apartment      s best branded and opinion shifting product integration in a scripted show       Television shows going back to the     s with The Love Boat featured product placements when using the Princess Cruise Lines and shows as recent as Modern Family have featured characters trying to procure an Apple iPad        Video sharing website edit  YouTubers are allowed to do product placement  For instance  the LinusTechTips channel by Linus Sebastian       Notifying YouTube is required       and YouTube reserves the right to ban it        Literature edit  In       British author Fay Weldon published The Bulgari Connection  a novel commissioned by Italian jewellery company Bulgari  According to The Independent  this was the first instance of a literary product placement deal between an established writer of fiction and a commercial partner        Legal considerations edit  United States edit  Much of U S  broadcast law pertaining to on air product promotion dates to the payola scandals of     s broadcast radio  An investigation launched in November      into allegations that some radio disc jockeys had accepted bribes in return for radio airplay      ended with a US       fine for disc jockey Alan Freed  of WABC and WINS  for violating commercial bribery laws  On September           the U S  government banned payola in broadcasting  Under    U S C         All matter broadcast by any radio station for which money  service  or other valuable consideration is directly or indirectly paid  or promised to or charged or accepted by  the station so broadcasting  from any person  shall  at the time the same is so broadcast  be announced as paid for or furnished  as the case may be  by such person     with similar and related provisions reflected in Federal Communications Commission regulations as    CFR               These provisions have governed subsequent payola investigations  including a      investigation into Sony BMG and other major record companies       Often  a broadcaster claimed to have complied by placing an acknowledgement in an inconspicuous place  such as embedded within the credits       In      U S  Federal Communications Commission commissioner Jonathan Adelstein stated  if broadcasters and cable TV companies insist on further commercializing new and other shows alike  that is their business  But if they do so without disclosing it to the viewing public  that is payola  and that is the FCC s business         United Kingdom edit   The  PP  icon  introduced by Ofcom to identify programs on television which contain product placement  In the United Kingdom  placement by commercial broadcasters was forbidden prior to       On February           telecommunications regulator Ofcom legalised placements in certain types of programming  A placement must be  editorially justified  and not place  undue prominence  on the product  Product placements are not allowed for products that cannot legally be advertised on television  including alcohol  baby milk  gambling products  medication or junk food  Placements are not allowed during children s  news  public affairs and religious programs  Additionally  broadcasters must disclose placements on air by displaying a  PP  icon on screen during the program for at least three seconds at the beginning  after every commercial break  and at the end  The first legal product placement on British television came during an episode of This Morning  for a Nestl  produced coffee maker  As with all other advertising  the BBC is barred from using placements on its publicly funded services             Extreme examples edit  Back to the Future Part II included production placement for futuristic versions of Nike footwear  Pepsi Cola and USA Today       Blade Runner included prominent placement for many brands  The logos of Atari  Bell  Coca Cola  Cuisinart and Pan Am  all market leaders at the time  were prominently displayed  and all experienced setbacks after the film s release       Coca Cola and Cuisinart recovered  and Tsingtao beer was also featured in the film and was more successful after the film than before       I  Robot offers placements for Converse  Ovaltine  Audi  FedEx  Dos Equis and JVC among others  all of them introduced within the film s first ten minutes  One moment includes a straightforward advertisement where Will Smith s character responds to a compliment about his shoes  to which he replies  Converse All Stars  vintage             the year of the film s release   Audi created a special car for the film  the Audi RSQ  Surveys conducted in the US showed that the placements boosted the brand s image       The Audi RSQ appears for nine minutes  and other Audis also appear in the film       I  Robot was ranked  the worst film for product placement  on a British site       The Island features at least    individual products or brands  including cars  bottled water  shoes  credit cards  beer  ice cream  and a web search engine            In the movie s DVD Commentary track  director Michael Bay claims he added the advertisements for greater realism       Josie and the Pussycats contains placements in most of the shots  This appears to be done ironically  as the plot of the film revolves around subliminal messages in advertising  The film s general message can also be construed as an anti consumerist one  The film neither sought nor received compensation for the placements  citation needed  The      Star Trek  in a scene where young James Kirk drives and crashes a Chevrolet Corvette  he operates a Nokia touch screen smartphone  Before running the car off the cliff while being chased by a hovering motorcycle cop  the distinct Nokia trademark ring tone can be heard  The Finnish phone maker offered Star Trek apps for its phones  The use of contemporary products was ridiculed  as the scene is set in the year             The Package   a      episode of Hawaii Five    was heavily criticised and mocked for a    second sequence in which a character praised Subway sandwiches and promoted the Subway diet                           The      Filipino film My Little Bossings attracted criticism for its extensive use of product placement  Reviewers panned the film for being  one long commercial   where advertisements for brands endorsed by the characters  actors are frequently interspersed into the film            Zig Marasigan of Rappler described the film s use of product endorsements as  some of the most distasteful examples of local product placement while no effort is made to weave them into the narrative        In a similar vein to early radio and television programs  sponsored programs in the Philippines are not uncommon  where children s programs like Tropang Potchi and Jollitown were produced on behalf of companies  prominently featuring products and related properties in the shows in question  citation needed   Viewer response edit  In April       fans of the television series Chuck responded to a placement by Subway restaurants with a grassroots effort to save the show from cancellation       The movement gained support from cast and crew  with series star Zachary Levi leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in Birmingham  United Kingdom        Criticisms edit  Placement continues to grow  despite consumer groups such as Commercial Alert that object to the practise as  an affront to basic honesty   The group requested disclosure of all product placement arrangements and notification before and during embedded advertisements  It justifies this to allow parents to protect easily influenced children       In       the Writers Guild of America  a trade union representing authors of television scripts  objected that its members were forced to produce disguised ad copy       Some scholars argue that product placement may inherently affect the creativity and originality of movies as film producers may re write scripts in order to incorporate products       Most typically  product placement and merchandise are most successful amongst specific genres of movies which may eventually limit the diversity of films        Research edit  Effectiveness edit  As with most marketing tactics  product placement leads to explicit as well as implicit advertising effects  Explicit effects can be observed directly and are usually visible by higher recall scores            They are highly connected to the conscious mind       Implicit effects can be observed by a change in behavior   like a higher purchase intention                 They are fully based on the subconscious mind            Implicit effects are more relevant for purchase decisions and therefore more valuable than explicit reactions            According to a      study of product placement in movies from       product placement in movies are effective financially  The study observed the relationship of a company having a product placed in a movie and that company s stock price  After accounting for other variables  the study found that companies on average have their stock price increase by       due to product placement during the movie s opening        Recall edit  Recall describes whether people can name a product after seeing it within the content  Research showed that there is a significant relationship between product placement and recall                       Attitude edit  Product placement also leads to changes in attitude towards the product or brand                       Purchase intention edit  A lot of research has shown a higher purchase intention as a result of product placement                            Subconscious effects edit  Product placement affects the audience on a conscious  but also subconscious level  Science showed that there does not even need to be an explicit  conscious effect to activate subconscious effects                      For example  product placement can lead to an exclusion of competing brands from the consideration set of the audience   subconsciously            It is also hoped to bypass advertising defense reactions of consumers by focusing on the subconscious character of product placement        Negative effects edit  Under specific circumstances  product placement can lead to no               or even negative effects                     This usually happens if the product placement is too obvious  while the audience also feels it is being manipulated                 Placement moderators edit  Congruence edit  The better the product placement fits the surrounding content  the better the implicit effectiveness  like attitude or purchase intention  will be                       Audio vs visual edit  After viewing a Seinfeld episode with visual  auditory and audiovisual product placements  a recall task indicated that audiovisual product placements were recalled the best  visual product placements somewhat less and audio placements least  In a recognition test audiovisual was still remembered the best but audio placements were remembered second best and visual placements were remembered third best       As indicated  the type of placement that is most effective seems to vary depending on task  but audiovisual placements seem to be often the most effective       However  audiovisual product placements are not remembered best when there is more than one audiovisual placement at once  making it hard to remember each one       In case the placement is only on the audio level  advertisers must make sure it is very prominent to have any effect at all                 Character attractiveness edit  People tended to like brand names that were paired with attractive faces more than those paired with unattractive faces  The more times a brand was paired with an attractive face  the more people liked it        Product prominence edit  Product placement perceived to disrupt a movie  especially when repeated  were found in one study to be counterproductive  Moderate repetition of subtle product placements did not increase people s feelings of distraction       Products that are integrated within the plot of a movie are better recall  although not if more than one product is shown at a time       In one study placements connected to the story were recognized most often  products used by the main character were remembered less often and products in the background were remembered least often       Placements were found more effective on a larger screen compared to on a smaller one       Also  products placed in the first half of a movie tend to be remembered better than products in the second half of a movie  which demonstrates the primacy effect        Level of Involvement edit  High involvement with the program makes it easier for people to recognize the product placement            This can lead to positive effects            but might also lead to negative reactions       The same applies for high product category involvement        Audience demographics edit  Cultural attributes edit  Older research cited a difference between different cultural areas  For example  Australians       Austrians       and Germans           tended to evaluate product placement more critically and show less positive reactions than Americans or people from certain Asian countries such as India                  Age edit  Children are usually more easily influenced than adults                 In a      study on children s  age       ability to recognize product placement in film  the following results were found  Children between ages   and   did not understand that a company had to pay for the product to be in the film or had confusion on why a company would pay to have a product appear in a film  After age    most children were able to identify that an external company paid for the product to appear  Children between age   and   could not identify themselves as the target audience for the product placement  After age    most children understood that the product placement was targeted towards them  Children between age   and   could not identify the intention of product placement  Children between age    and    still had confusion over the intention of a company placing their product in a film  Children over the age of    had full understanding of the marketing intentions of a company placing its product in a film        Sex edit  If the product is endorsed by a person  there are stronger priming effects if the audience is the same sex       Women tend to be influenced a little easier            but show more negative reactions when the product can be described as ethically questionable  e g  alcohol         Measurement edit  Tools It is very difficult to measure the impact of a product placement on viewers   access to exposed audience  recruitment  interviews  database for results comparison  independence from agencies    And more of    criteria must be analysed to be comprehensive       To measure the success of product placement  one first tracks the parameters of the placement itself  like the ease of identification  screen time  number of exposure s   or association with a main character  That information is also often used to determine the price of a specific placement  Secondly  the effectiveness is measured using direct  for explicit memory effects  as well as indirect  for implicit memory effects  measurements   Measurement of the explicit memory edit  Explicit effects are measured by recall or recognition tests  Subjects are asked to name the products that he or she noticed  free recall             This survey can be also aided by giving additional information like a specific product category       At recognition tests  a selection of products is shown to the interviewed person  who then needs to select the ones that he has seen before             Measurement of the implicit memory edit  Implicit effects are measured in an indirect way by observing a change in behavior            This can be done by tracking the consideration set and buying behavior of people                 measuring brain activities      or using abstract indirect test settings like the word fragment or word stem completion test       The implicit association test  IAT  is also an applicable measurement tool             Ethics edit  Many argue that product placement is ethically questionable  because it manipulates people against their will                      A contrary view is  even if product placement is only perceived unconsciously  it is still evaluated by our mind            It cannot make people act against their beliefs  Most people also appreciate the fact that movies look more realistic with real brands and do not feel disturbed by the placements            Additionally  further research argues that product placement is not any different from other marketing tactics when it comes to ethics        See also edit  Subliminal advertising The Greatest Movie Ever Sold References edit      Gail Schiller  June            Win  Draw for Burnett Branding
