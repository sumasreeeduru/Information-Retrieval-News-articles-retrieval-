net  NTL offered a similar package called NTL Freedom   Merger and Virgin Mobile acquisition edit  Telewest and NTL began discussions about a merger in late       Thanks to their geographically

Telewest  to form one of the largest media companies in the UK  The merger agreement as structured would have required NTL to negotiate with BBC Worldwide  the BBC s commercial arm  due to a change of ownership clause written into the agreement for UKTV  a joint venture with Telewest s Flextech content division  To prevent this  Telewest instead acquired NTL  In December      NTL Telewest and mobile virtual network operator  MVNO  Virgin Mobile UK announced that talks had taken place regarding a merger      Virgin Mobile s independent directors rejected the original bid of      million

proposed merger      after a similar announcement by ITV      BSkyB effectively blocked the merger on    November      by controversially buying a       stake in ITV plc      a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder Richard Branson      and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom      On   December      NTL announced that it had complained to the Office of Fair Trading

on   March       Virgin Media replaced the Sky    Sky    Sky Travel  Sky Travel Extra  Sky Sports News and Sky News channel content with a standard message  Sky attributed part of the rate rise to the fact that the new deal would also include Sky    Sky Arts and undisclosed high definition and video on demand content  Sky said the deal would cost only  p per customer per day  roughly             per year   but Virgin said that a minimum payment guarantee included in the contract meant that the actual amount due would exceed twice the current payment      On   March      the National Consumer Council accused Sky and Virgin of  behaving like children  and stated that it would consider whether or not to raise a super complaint against them  that will help to knock heads together  by the end of that month      Then on   March      Virgin Media threatened to take legal action against BSkyB if the matter remained unresolved in    days      On    April      Virgin Media filed a legal case in

  with Virgin replacing the UKTV channels on their service with other networks      This led to a backlash by customers with some threatening to leave      The dispute finally ended after three weeks

Blueyonder  Telewest s cable broadband operations  and Virgin net  ADSL  broadband Internet access through a non cable telephone line   Virgin Broadband in cabled areas is marketed as  fibre optic broadband   It is a FTTN network  where fibre optic trunk lines are used to connect the area s headend to cabinets on the street  citation needed  It is not a fibre to the home service like Verizon FiOS  instead  the link between the cabinet and the customer uses DOCSIS     over coaxial copper cable  In July      and       Virgin Media Broadband came first in an Ofcom broadband speed test in the UK          Ofcom tested typical speeds of broadband services provided by most ISPs in the UK  including BSkyB  BT  Tiscali  AOL  TalkTalk  Plusnet  O  and Orange  Since most broadband connections in the UK are provided by ADSL  and the quality of individual phone lines varies according to distance from exchange      most landline broadband services are marketed as being the maximum speed that the individual s phone line will support   up to  mb   As a result  actual speeds obtained vary greatly  but are always constrained by the individual phone line   the quality of which is out of the control of the broadband provider  Cable broadband has no such speed variability caused by connection quality as the network is fully owned and controlled by the cable company providing the broadband   any slowdowns are wholly as a result of traffic shaping  or local capacity being over sold or over subscribed  For this reason  the results showed that Virgin Media s broadband speed was closer to  although still not      of  the  up to  figures it advertised  compared to the other providers tested  While landline broadband providers offered rates of  up to     Mbit s  the launch of a Virgin s    Mbit s service on    December      was advertised as  the UK s Fastest Broadband       On   October       Virgin Media began trials to deliver its TV and broadband services at up to    Mbit s

telephone poles to deliver    Mbit s broadband and TV services to the Berkshire village of Woolhampton      Virgin Media identified more than one million homes in parts of the UK that could benefit from deployment over telephone poles  without the need for government subsidy  During July the trial was extended to existing commercial infrastructure in the Welsh village of Crumlin  Caerphilly      On   October       Ofcom ordered BT to open up its fibre optic network to competing broadband providers to help drive forward the rollout of high speed internet services in the UK      Ofcom further ordered BT to free up access to network infrastructure   including all telephone poles and underground ducts   for the rollout of broadband to areas BT does not plan to reach  Virgin Media confirmed plans to expand its broadband network in the UK by using the infrastructure owned by BT      By using the approach  the company hoped to expand its network to reach as many as    million of the UK s   m homes  On    October       Virgin Media announced its     Mbit s downstream broadband service  featuring    Mbit s upstream rates  which went on sale on   December           Early service areas were

to be complete by mid           On    January       Virgin Media announced plans to double the speeds of selected broadband packages  its    Mbit s package will increase to    Mbit s     Mbit s and

the announcement  Virgin Media has confirmed that it now plans to also upgrade   Mbit s customers to    Mbit s at no extra cost  in effect cutting the monthly fee for existing    Mbit s customers      On    November       Virgin Media announced its     Mbit s downstream broadband service  featuring    Mbit s upstream rates  which started rolling out to customers from    February           The company also upgraded existing customers  from   Mb to   Mb    Mb to    Mb  and    Mb to the new    Mb service  The rollout is expected to be completed by early       In February       Virgin Media

Virgin Broadband employs a form of bandwidth throttling whereby customer bandwidth is reduced temporarily after a threshold is reached during peak periods  The company has experimented with and revised all parameters involved in the throttling  such as threshold size  peak period definitions  throttling percentage and duration  Separate thresholds are applied to upstream and downstream  and thresholds vary between packages  From    February       Virgin Media announced that they were scrapping traffic management for downstream traffic on   Mb or higher packages  which was welcomed by many customers  As a result of this    Mb or higher packages are only throttled on the upstream  where as   Mb or below packages are throttled on both the upstream and the downstream      Example of throttling in action  based in May      scheme   Customer has an L     Mbit s  package  which has a  GB threshold during    am  pm and a     GB threshold between   pm  pm with a     throttle for five hours  Customer downloads over  GB on Tuesday morning between    am  pm  The customer is then throttled to     Mbit s for the next five hours from the time that they exceed the threshold  after which normal service is resumed      In       Virgin Media changed     their traffic management policy to the detriment of their customers  The new policy stated a maximum throttling amount of     on most

Broadband  on            By       its market share had dropped slightly to      behind BT       and Sky        Virgin Television has currently update  around     million subscribers           million of them are digital cable customers  and the other         are analogue cable customers  Virgin makes up around     of the UK s TV distributors  with Freeview having the most  and Sky being second  citation needed   Advertising edit  Virgin Media launched in February       with a public relations event and expensive advertising campaign covering major UK television channels  newspapers and billboards  Television advertising featured actress Uma Thurman  comedian Ruby Wax  and actors Samuel L  Jackson  Marc Warren  and David Tennant  Virgin Media also sponsored the Channel   reality TV show Big Brother in its eighth series in      and its Celebrity Hijack and ninth series in       In       Virgin Media launched a multimillion pound ad campaign starring Usain Bolt and Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson to promote Virgin s superfast broadband service  The TV adverts were directed by Seth Gordon and involved Bolt impersonating Branson       On   June       Southampton F C  announced that Virgin Media would become the club s shirt sponsor on a three year deal        Controversies edit  Net neutrality edit  In April       acting Virgin CEO Neil Berkett sparked controversy when he told Television  a magazine published by the Royal Television Society   this net neutrality thing is a load of bollocks   According to the journalist  he claimed that any video content provider that refused to pay Virgin Media a premium for faster access would have to get stuck in  bus lanes   having their content delivered to end users at much slower speeds than that of paying content providers       There has been widespread criticism of this policy expressed on the internet  large internet communities are requesting that Virgin customers end their subscription and initiate a mass boycott       According to Virgin Media  the comments in the article were taken out of context and misinterpreted       A statement released by the company states   With Virgin Media rolling out a   Mb service later this year  we are uniquely equipped to cope with the demand for new bandwidth hungry services  We strongly support the principle that the internet should remain a space that is open to all and we have not called for content providers to pay for distribution  However  we recognise that as more customers turn to the web for content  different providers will have different needs and priorities and in the long term  it s legitimate to question how this demand will be managed  We welcome an informed debate on this issue    Crackdown on illegal filesharing of copyrighted material edit  On   April       The Daily Telegraph reported that Virgin Media would be beginning a trial to take action against subscribers who are illegally downloading copyrighted material from internet Peer to peer  P P  services  Information of offenders would be provided by the British Phonographic Industry  and then Virgin Media and the BPI sends a warning letter to the customer            Virgin Media and the BPI denied reports of any agreement or pilot scheme and said they were only in talks on the matter       However  at least one person claimed to have received a letter threatening disconnection       Although the UK government backed plans to ban p p users from the internet  it may soon be overturned by strong condemnation from the European Parliament on the grounds of privacy issues and the importance of internet access       In July       the BBC reported that     Virgin Media customers who the BPI claim are sharing copyrighted files were sent warning letters in envelopes marked  If you don t read this  your broadband connection could be disconnected   At least one recipient of the letter denied any wrongdoing by any authorised user of his broadband connection       On    November       it was revealed that Virgin Media would trial deep packet inspection technology to measure the level of illegal file sharing on its network       The CView system  provided by Detica  will look at traffic and identify the peer to peer packets  It will then peer inside those packets and try to determine what is licensed and what is unlicensed  based on data provided by the record industry  The trial   which has no scheduled end date   will cover about     of Virgin Media s network but those involved will not be informed  Virgin Media emphasised that it is seeking to measure the overall level of illegal file sharing  not to keep records on individual customers  Data on the level of copyright infringement will be aggregated and anonymised  On    January       the European Commission confirmed that although it had not discussed the matter with Virgin Media  it would  closely monitor  the trial       Privacy International announced that it would press a criminal complaint with the Metropolitan Police  because it argued that under the Privacy and Electronic Communications  EC Directive  Regulations  PECR  and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act  RIPA  as well as the European ePrivacy Directive  interception and processing of communications requires either explicit informed consent from all parties or a warrant  On   May       it was reported that Virgin Media had become the first ISP in the UK to implement a web filter to block access to The Pirate Bay  in compliance with a UK High Court order in April       although there continues to be a great number of mirrors  proxies  or VPNs  so this has proved unsuccessful        Charging exit fees edit  Virgin Media charges customers exit fees when they move to a location where they are unable to receive Virgin Media services  Ofcom is investigating Virgin Media for this practice and was due to make a preliminary decision in April                 In an update in May       Ofcom reported that it had reasonable grounds to believe that Virgin had contravened one of its General Conditions by  setting and charging customers early termination charges  ETCs  which were too high  requiring customers moving house to an area within Virgin s network to sign up to a new fixed term contract or pay ETCs  and failing to take action to ensure that its conditions and procedures for contract termination did not act as disincentives to its customers against changing provider  Ofcom also found it had reasonable grounds for believing Virgin had contravened another General Condition when it failed to publish on its website clear and up to date information about the ETCs payable when fixed term contracts are terminated        Data pimping edit  In early       it was announced that the ISP arm of Virgin Media had entered into a contract  along with BT and TalkTalk  with the former spyware company Phorm  responsible under their    Media guise for the Apropos rootkit            to intercept and analyse their users  click stream data  and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of Phorm s OIX advertising service            The practice  which has become known as  data pimping   came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested parties who believe that the interception of data is illegal under UK law  RIPA             At a more fundamental level  many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity  a user s data  to which they have no claim of ownership  Though Phorm initially claimed Virgin Media had signed an exclusive contract and were committed to implementing Phorm s Webwise tracking system  Virgin Media have since distanced themselves from this and now state that they have only signed a preliminary contract with Phorm to better understand the tracking technology  and are under no obligation to implement it       Reports on the Guardian website in May      suggested Virgin Media may be further distancing themselves from the controversial system        Wikipedia censorship edit  Main article  Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia In December       Virgin Media was one of several ISPs in the UK to attempt to censor its users  access to the Wikipedia article about the      album Virgin Killer by stadium rock band Scorpions       The album cover has generated controversy  as it features the partially obscured image of a naked  underage girl  The Wikipedia article includes this image and its URL was blacklisted by the Internet Watch Foundation after a user complaint  The blacklisting has since been rescinded   Security issues edit     month exposure to data theft edit  In March       it became known that the Virgin Media marketing database accommodating the personal details  phone numbers  home and email addresses  of         users was left unsecured for    months  The company admitted that a member of their staff hadn t followed the correct security procedures  which resulted in the system s vulnerability  It is known for sure that at least one occasion of unauthorized access took place throughout these    months  A forensic investigation was launched after shutting down access to gauge the extent of damage and determine whether some data was theft        See also edit  Virgin Media Television  Ireland    a separate Liberty Global
