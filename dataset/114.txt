series of web browsers formerly produced by Netscape Communications Corporation  a former subsidiary of AOL  The original browser was once the dominant browser in terms of usage share  but as a result of the first browser war  it lost virtually all of its share to Internet Explorer     Netscape was discontinued and support for all Netscape browsers and client products was terminated on March

Navigator was the name of Netscape s web browser from versions     through      The first version of the browser was released in       known as Mosaic and then Mosaic Netscape until a legal challenge from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications  makers of NCSA Mosaic  which many of Netscape s founders had spent time developing  which led to the name change to Netscape Navigator     The company s name also changed from Mosaic Communications Corporation to Netscape Communications Corporation  The browser was the most advanced available and was an instant success  becoming market leader while still in beta  Netscape s feature count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version     was released  Version     added a full mail reader called Netscape Mail  thus transforming Netscape from a mere web browser to an Internet suite  During this period  both the browser and the suite were known as Netscape Navigator  Around the same time  AOL started bundling their software with Microsoft s Internet Explorer  Version     of Netscape was the first to face any serious competition in the form of Microsoft Internet Explorer      but Netscape held off Microsoft s challenge and remained the number one browser for the time  Version     was also available in a  Gold  version which featured a WYSIWYG HTML editor  later added to Netscape Communicator as a standard feature   and was sold as retail software for profit  Netscape     introduced many new features such as new plug ins  background colors for tables  the archive attribute  and the applet element  Netscape Navigator   was the undisputed web browser giant in its time with over     share  but it was later eroded by the free Internet Explorer included with Windows      Netscape Communicator  versions          edit  Main article  Netscape Communicator Netscape   addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator     After releasing five preview releases from            Netscape Corp  released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June       This new version  more or less based on Netscape Navigator   Code  updated and added new features  such as support of certain CSS  elements  minimal dynamic font support and the proprietary object element   The new suite was successful  despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer     and problems with the outdated browser core  The Communicator suite was made up of Netscape Navigator  Netscape Mail and Newsgroups  Netscape Address Book and Netscape Composer  an HTML editor  which later became Mozilla Composer and eventually was split off into a completely separate product  Nvu   In October      version     of Netscape Communicator was released  This new version featured various functionality improvements  especially in the Mail News component  but did not update the browser core  which  in its functionality  was basically identical with version        Only one month later  Netscape Communications Corporation was bought by AOL  A standalone version of Netscape Navigator was still available  but this was discontinued after version      for Windows  Standalone versions for other operating systems such as Unix Linux were maintained up to version      On January           Netscape Communications Corporation announced that all future versions of their software would be free of charge and developed by an Open Source Community  Mozilla      Netscape Communicator     was announced  codenamed  Gromit    But there were significant delays to the release of Netscape s next major version and Communicator therefore aged badly over the many years it was still used  As a result of this  and a more advanced support of HTML    CSS  DOM  and ECMAScript by Internet Explorer starting with version    the more up to date Internet Explorer     became the market leader  In November      work on Netscape     was cancelled in favor of developing a completely new program from scratch   Netscape Communicator      cancelled  edit  Netscape      codenamed  Gromit      was a continuation of the   x code  but only two pre alpha versions were written  one based on original Communicator code  with layout engine stability and performance enhancements to the     codebase  codenamed Mariner  and another using the Gecko layout engine     Though Netscape had originally intended to deploy Mariner and later replace it with Gecko  which had been developed from scratch   Netscape   and Mariner were scrapped completely  However  the versions continued to be numbered as if it had been released  Netscape formed the Mozilla Foundation and developed the Mozilla Application Suite using Gecko  The open source Mozilla browser was in turn used as the basis for Netscape     Mozilla Application Suite based releases edit  Netscape    versions            edit   Netscape Navigator     Main article  Netscape   In       an informal group called the Mozilla Organization was formed and largely funded by Netscape  the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape  to coordinate the development of Netscape    codenamed  Gromit    which would be based on the Communicator source code  The aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was made in late October to drop the code branch of the Communicator     core rendering engine and start from scratch using the standards compliant Gecko rendering engine        Gecko featured in the Mozilla web browser  which  with a few additions  Netscape   was based on  This decision meant that Netscape s next major version was severely delayed  In the meantime  Netscape was taken over by AOL who  acting under pressure from the Web Standards Project  forced its new division to release Netscape     in       With public beta versions released in April      August      and October      Netscape     was released in November           The suite again consisted of Netscape Navigator and the other Communicator components  with the addition of a built in AOL Instant Messenger client  branded as Netscape Instant Messenger  However  it was clear that Netscape   was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly  It was based on Mozilla      which was not ready to be used by the general public yet due to many serious bugs that would cause it to crash often or render web pages slowly  Later versions of Netscape   were much improved      x was regarded as an especially good release   but the browser still struggled to make an impact on a disappointed community   Netscape  versions          edit  Main article  Netscape   Netscape      codenamed  Mach Five  and based on Mozilla        was released in August      was a direct continuation of Netscape   with very similar components  It picked up a few users  but was still very much a minority browser  one of the problems being that Mozilla itself was a worthy adversary  In addition  AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla s popup blocker functionality in Netscape      which created an outrage in the community  In response to the complaints  AOL integrated the pop up blocker into Netscape       In addition  Netscape introduced a new AOL free version  without the usual AOL addons  of the browser suite  Netscape      codenamed  Buffy  and based on Mozilla      was released in June       In       AOL closed down its Netscape division and laid off or reassigned all of Netscape s employees  Mozilla org continued as the independent Mozilla Foundation  taking on many of Netscape s ex employees  AOL continued to develop Netscape in house  but  due to there being no staff committed to it  improvements were minimal  One year later  in August       the last version based on Mozilla was released  Netscape      based on Mozilla         Mozilla Firefox based releases edit  Netscape Browser  version            edit   Netscape Browser       Main article  Netscape Browser Between      and       Netscape s releases became known as Netscape Browser  AOL chose to base Netscape Browser on the relatively successful Mozilla Firefox  a re written version of Mozilla produced by the Mozilla Foundation  This release is not a full Internet suite as before  but is solely a web browser  Other controversial decisions include these versions being made only for Microsoft Windows and featuring both the Gecko rendering engine of previous releases and the Trident engine used in Internet Explorer  AOL s acquisition of Netscape years earlier made it less of a surprise when the company laid off the Netscape team and outsourced development to Mercurial Communications  Netscape Browser       was released on April          and included general bug fixes identified in versions                    Netscape Navigator  version      edit  Main article  Netscape Navigator   Netscape confirmed on    January      that Netscape Browser versions           was to be succeeded by a new stand alone browser release  Netscape Navigator    Its features were said to include newsfeed support and become more integrated with the Propeller Internet portal      alongside more enhanced methods of discussion  submission and voting on web pages      It also sees the browser return to multi platform support across Windows  Linux and Mac OS X      Like Netscape version   x  the new release was based upon the popular Mozilla Firefox  version       and had full support of all Firefox add ons and plugins  some of which Netscape provided      Also for the first time since       the browser was produced in house with its own programming staff      A beta of the program was first released on   June           The final version was released on October           On December           Netscape developers announced that AOL would discontinue their web browser on February          due to low market share      On January           Netscape revised this date to March          and offered support for migration to Flock and Mozilla Firefox       Release compatibility edit    Operating system  Latest version   Mac OS  v  x
