Jewellery Channel was fined        by Trading Standards for making false claims about the treatment of a gemstone product sold through its TV channel  After complaints were made  the channel discovered that it had been selling jewellery described as natural  pink topaz   when in fact it was colourless topaz sprayed pink  Auction date     August        The ASA received a complaint as to whether an auction starting price was misleading and exaggerated the item s value   Although the Jewellery Channel attributes no worth or value to the starting price  the ASA upheld the complaint on the grounds that  in this case  most viewers would infer that the opening figure represented a genuine valuation of the ring  and therefore the final reduced price was a genuine saving   Platform

move up where every channel from channel    to    on the platform moved up one place to allow BBC Four to move to channel    in Scotland due to new Ofcom rules regarding certain PSB channels requiring
