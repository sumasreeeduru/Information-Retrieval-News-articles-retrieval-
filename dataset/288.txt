BBC Radio Wales is broadcast across Wales on AM  FM and DAB  It is also availabale on Freeview in Wales and throughout the UK on Freesat  Sky and Virgin Media  As Radio Wales was created from an opt out of BBC Radio    it inherited the medium wave transmitters previously used by Radio   across Wales the main service coming from  the Washford transmitter in Somerset on     kHz  This transmitter was originally built to cover southern Wales and most of the West Country  and has a far greater coverage than its intended transmission area  It can be heard across the Bristol area  in much of Devon and northern Cornwall  as well as eastern and south eastern counties of Ireland  Initially  Radio Wales was not broadcast on FM as Radio   s former FM transmitters in Wales were used for BBC Radio Cymru  In       Radio Wales gained some FM coverage with the creation of opt out service  BBC Radio Gwent  After the breakfast programme  Radio Gwent simulcast most of Radio Wales  output  When the station closed in       the FM frequencies were retained to broadcast Radio Wales  From      onwards  the BBC was able to start creating an FM network for Radio Wales  including a     kW ERP transmitter near Aberystwyth  On   December       Radio Wales added the     kW ERP Wenvoe transmitter to its network on       MHz FM  replacing a low power FM transmitter on the Wenallt Hill  On    October       the station increased its FM coverage in North East and Mid Wales by taking over    transmitters previously used by BBC Radio    The changeover allowed an estimated         listeners to receive Radio Wales on FM  extending its reach to a potential     of households in Wales     Regional opt outs have been established for sports coverage on FM  specifically live football commentaries involving Cardiff City in the South East  Swansea City in the South West and Wrexham in the North   Race discrimination case edit  In       presenter Lionel Kelleway won a case for racial discrimination against BBC Radio Wales  when they dropped his Landmark  series  which won Sony Awards in      and          after around ten years  because of his English accent         References edit
