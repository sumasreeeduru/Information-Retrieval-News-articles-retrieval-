 CRTC  French  Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des t l communications canadiennes  is a public organization in Canada with mandate as a regulatory agency for broadcasting and telecommunications  It was created in      when it took over responsibility for regulating telecommunication carriers  Prior to       it was known as the Canadian Radio and Television Commission  which was established in      by the Parliament of Canada to replace the Board of Broadcast Governors  Its headquarters is located in the Central Building   difice central  of Les Terrasses de la Chaudi re in Gatineau  Quebec

originally known as the Canadian Radio Television Commission  In       jurisdiction over telecommunications services  most of which were then delivered by monopoly common carriers  for example  telephone companies   was transferred to it from the Canadian Transport Commission although the abbreviation CRTC remained the same  On the telecom side  the CRTC originally regulated only privately held common carriers   BC Tel  merged with Telus   which served British Columbia  in which a U S  company  GTE  held a substantial stake Bell Canada  which served much of Ontario and Quebec  and the eastern part of the Northwest Territories  now Nunavut  telephone operations owned by crown corporation Canadian National Railways in Newfoundland  Terra Nova Tel   the Northwest Territories  Yukon and northern B C   the latter three being Northwestel   Other telephone companies  many of which were publicly owned and entirely within a province s borders  were regulated by provincial authorities until court rulings during the     s affirmed federal jurisdiction over the sector  which also included some fifty small independent incumbents  most of them in Ontario and Quebec  Notable in this group were   Newfoundland Telephone Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Island Telephone  Island Tel  New Brunswick Telephone  NBTel  Manitoba Telephone System  MTS  SaskTel Alberta Government Telephones  AGT  Northern Telephone  Ontario  T l bec municipal telephone services in Prince Rupert  B C   CityWest  and Thunder Bay  Tbaytel  Jurisdiction The CRTC regulates all Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications activities and enforces rules it creates to carry out the policies assigned to it  the best known of these is probably the Canadian content rules  The CRTC reports to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister of Canadian Heritage  which is responsible for the Broadcasting Act  and has an informal relationship with Industry Canada  which is responsible for the Telecommunications Act  Provisions in these two acts  along with less formal instructions issued by the federal cabinet known as orders in council  represent the bulk of the CRTC s jurisdiction  In many cases  such as the cabinet directed prohibition on foreign ownership for broadcasters    and the legislated principle of the predominance of Canadian content     these acts and orders often leave the CRTC less room to change policy than critics sometimes suggest  and the result is that the commission is often the lightning rod for policy criticism that could arguably be better directed at the government itself  Complaints against broadcasters  such as concerns around offensive programming  are dealt with by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council  CBSC   an independent broadcast industry association  rather than by the CRTC  although CBSC decisions can be appealed to the CRTC if necessary  However  the CRTC is also sometimes erroneously criticized for CBSC decisions   for example  the CRTC was erroneously criticized for the CBSC s decisions pertaining to the airing of Howard Stern s terrestrial radio show in Canada in the late     s  as well as the CBSC s controversial ruling on the Dire Straits song  Money for Nothing      The commission is not fully equivalent to the U S  Federal Communications Commission  which has additional powers over technical matters  in broadcasting and other aspects of communications  in that country  In Canada  Innovation  Science and Economic Development Canada  formerly Industry Canada  is responsible for allocating frequencies and call signs  managing the broadcast spectrum  and regulating other technical issues such as interference with electronics equipment   Regulation of broadcast distributors The CRTC has in the past regulated the prices cable television broadcast distributors are allowed to charge  In most major markets  however  prices are no longer regulated due to increased competition for broadcast distribution from satellite television  The CRTC also regulates which channels broadcast distributors must or may offer  Per the Broadcasting Act    the commission also gives priority to Canadian signals many non Canadian channels which compete with Canadian channels are thus not approved for distribution in Canada  The CRTC argues that allowing free trade in television stations would overwhelm the smaller Canadian market  preventing it from upholding its responsibility to foster a national conversation  Some people  however  consider this tantamount to censorship  The CRTC s simultaneous substitution rules require that when a Canadian network licences a television show from a US network and shows it in the same time slot  upon request by the Canadian broadcaster  Canadian broadcast distributors must replace the show on the US channel with the broadcast of the Canadian channel  along with any overlays and commercials   As Grey s Anatomy is on ABC  but is carried in Canada on CTV at the same time  for instance  the cable  satellite  or other broadcast distributor must send the CTV feed over the signal of the carried ABC affiliate  even where the ABC version is somehow different  particularly commercials      These rules are not intended to apply in case of differing episodes of the same series  this difference may not always be communicated to distributors  although this is rather rare   Viewers via home antenna who receive both American and Canadian networks on their personal sets are not affected by sim sub  The goal of this policy is to create a market in which Canadian networks can realize revenue through advertising sales in spite of their inability to match the rates that the much larger American networks can afford to pay for syndicated programming  This policy is also why Canadian viewers do not see American advertisements during the Super Bowl  even when tuning into one of the many American networks carried on Canadian televisions  The CRTC also regulates radio in Canada  including community radio  where the CRTC requires that at least     of each station s output must be locally produced spoken word content      Regulation of the Internet In a major May      decision on  New Media   the CRTC held that under the Broadcasting Act the CRTC had jurisdiction over certain content communicated over the Internet including audio and video  but excluding content that is primarily alphanumeric such as emails and most webpages  It also issued an exemption order committing to a policy of non interference     In May       in response to the increase presence of Over the Top  OTT  programming  the CRTC put a call out to the public to provide input on the impact OTT programming is having on Canadian content and existing broadcasting subscriptions through satellite and cable      On October         the CRTC released their findings that included consultations with stakeholders from the telecommunication industry  media producers  and cultural leaders among others   The evidence was inconclusive  suggesting that an increased availability of OTT options is not having a negative impact on the availability or diversity of Canadian content  one of the key policy mandates of the CRTC  nor are there signs that there has been a significant decline of television subscriptions through cable or satellite  However  given the rapid progress in the industry they are working on a more in depth study to be concluded in May           The CRTC does not directly regulate rates  quality of service issues  or business practices for Internet service providers  However  the CRTC does continually monitor the sector and associated trends      To handle complains  the CRTC was ordered by the Government of Canada to create an independent  industry funded agency to resolve complaints from consumers and small business retail telecom customers  In July       the Commission for Complaints for Telecom Television Services  CCTS  opened its doors      Third Party ISP Access refers to a ruling forcing Cable operators  MSO  to offer Internet access to third party resellers   Regulation of telephone service The commission currently has some jurisdiction over the provision of local landline telephone service in Canada  This is largely limited to the major incumbent carriers  such as Bell Canada and Telus  for traditional landline service  but not Voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP    It has begun the gradual deregulation of such services where  in the commission s opinion  a sufficient level of competition exists      The CRTC is sometimes blamed for the current state of the mobile phone industry in Canada  in which there are only three national mobile network operators   Bell Mobility  Telus Mobility  and Rogers Wireless   as well as a handful of MVNOs operating on these networks  In fact  the commission has very little to do with the regulation of mobile phone service  outside of  undue preference  issues  for example  a carrier offering a superior rate or service to some subscribers and not others without a good reason    It does not regulate service rates  service quality  or other business practices  and commission approval is not necessary for wireless provider sales or mergers as in the broadcasting industry      Moreover  it does not deal with the availability of spectrum for mobile phone service  which is part of the Industry Canada mandate  nor the maintenance of competition  which is largely the responsibility of The Competition Bureau   Transfers of ownership foreign ownership Any transfer of more than     of the ownership of a broadcasting licence  including cable satellite distribution licences  requires advance approval of the commission  One condition normally taken into account in such a decision is the level of foreign ownership  federal regulations require that Canadian citizens ultimately own a majority of a broadcast licence  Usually this takes the form of a public process  where interested parties can express their concerns and sometimes including a public hearing  followed by a commission decision  While landline and mobile telephone providers must also be majority owned by Canadians under the federal Telecommunications Act  the CRTC is not responsible for enforcement of this provision  In fact  the commission does not require licences at all for telephone companies  and CRTC approval is therefore not generally required for the sale of a telephone company  unless said company also owns a broadcast licence   Notable decisions Since       the CRTC has been involved in several notable  decisions  some of which led to controversy and debate   Milestone Radio Milestone Radio  In two separate rounds of licence hearings in the     s  the CRTC rejected applications by Milestone Radio to launch a radio station in Toronto which would have been Canada s first urban music station  in both cases  the CRTC instead granted licences to stations that duplicated formats already offered by other stations in the Toronto market  The decision has been widely cited as one of the single most significant reasons why Canadian hip hop had difficulty establishing its commercial viability throughout the     s      The CRTC finally granted a licence to Milestone in       after a cabinet order in council directed the commission to licence two new radio stations that reflected the cultural diversity of the Toronto market  and CFXJ FM launched in            CHOI FM CHOI FM  The CRTC announced it would not renew the licence of the popular CHOI FM radio station in Quebec City  after having previously sanctioned the station for failing to uphold its promise of performance and then  during the years following  receiving about    complaints about offensive behaviour by radio jockeys which similarly contravened CRTC rules on broadcast hate speech  Many thousands of the station s fans marched in the streets and on Parliament Hill against the decision  and the parent company of CHOI  Genex Corp   appealed the CRTC decision unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Canada   The station was later sold to RNC Media  but instead of renewing its licence the CRTC issued RNC a licence to launch a new radio station on the same frequency  citation needed   CBC Newsworld CBC Newsworld  The CRTC licensed the CBC on November          to provide a national all news television network  Its competitor applicant  Alberta based Allarcom  appealed this decision to the House of Commons of Canada  It was overturned and there were questions of whether federal politicians should meddle in CRTC decisions  Because of this the network launch was delayed from September         to July           citation needed   RAI International RAI International  In Summer       this Italian government controlled channel was denied permission to broadcast independently in Canada on the grounds that it had acted and was likely to act contrary to established Canadian policies  RAI International s latest politically appointed President  an avowed right wing nationalist and former spokesperson for Giorgio Almirante  the leader of the post fascist party of Italy  had unilaterally terminated a    year old agreement and stripped all of its       to       annual hours of programming from Telelatino  TLN   a Canadian run channel which had devoted     of its prime time schedule to RAI programs for    years since TLN was founded   All Italian Canadians were denied RAI programming by RAI International s removal of its programming from the Canadian marketplace  a move intended to create a public outcry and a threat that Canadians would resort to using satellite viewing cards obtained via the US in order to watch RAI  even though these cards were either grey market or black market  according to different analyses  see below   Following unprecedented foreign led and domestic political interference with the CRTC s quasi judicial independent regulatory process  within six months of its original decision  an abrupt CRTC  review  of its policy on third language foreign services determined to drop virtually all restrictions and adopt a new  open entry  approach to foreign controlled  third language   non English  non French  channels  citation needed   Al Jazeera Al Jazeera  Was approved by the CRTC in      as an optional cable and satellite offering  but on the condition that any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech  Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera  Although no cable company released data as to what such a monitoring service would cost  the end result was that no cable company elected to carry the station  either  leaving many Arabic speaking Canadians using free to air satellite dishes to watch the station   The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed its opinion over possible anti Semitic incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate  while the Canadian B nai Brith is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada  The CRTC ruling applied to Al Jazeera and not to its English speaking sister network Al Jazeera English  which was launched two years after the ruling  citation needed   Fox News Channel Fox News Channel  Until       the CRTC s apparent reluctance to grant a digital licence to Fox News Channel under the same policy which made it difficult for RAI to enter the country   same genre competition from foreign services   had angered many conservative Canadians  who believed the network was deliberately being kept out due to its perceived conservative bias  particularly given the long standing availability of services such as CNN and BBC World in Canada   On November           however  the CRTC approved an application by cable companies to offer Fox News Channel on the digital cable tier  Fox commenced broadcasting in Canada shortly thereafter       Satellite radio Satellite radio  In June       the CRTC outraged some Canadian cultural nationalists  such as the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting  and labour unions by licensing two companies  Canadian Satellite Radio and Sirius Canada to offer satellite radio services in Canada  The two companies are in partnership with American firms XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio respectively  and in accordance with the CRTC decision will only need to offer ten percent Canadian content  The CRTC contends that this low level of Canadian content  particularly when compared to the     rule on local radio stations  was necessary because unlicensed U S  receivers were already flooding into the country  so that enforcing a ban on these receivers would be nearly impossible  see below    This explanation did not satisfy cultural nationalists  who demanded that the federal cabinet overturn the decision and mandate a minimum of     Canadian content  Supporters of the decision argue that satellite radio can only be feasibly set up as a continental system  and trying to impose     Canadian content across North America is quite unrealistic  They also argue that satellite radio will boost Canadian culture by giving vital exposure to independent artists  instead of concentrating just on the country s stars  and point to the CRTC s successful extraction of promises to program     Canadian content on satellite services already operational in the United States as important concessions      Despite popular perception that the CRTC banned Sirius Canada from broadcasting Howard Stern s program  this is not the case  Sirius Canada in fact initially chose not to air Stern based on the possibility of a future issue with the CRTC  although the company reversed its decision and began offering Howard Stern in             Ottawa radio licence      Ottawa radio licences  On November           federal Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages James Moore issued a statement calling on the CRTC to review its approval of two new radio stations  Frank Torres  CIDG FM and Astral Media s CJOT FM  which it had licensed in August      to serve the Ottawa Gatineau radio market  Moore asked the commission to assess whether the francophone population of the Ottawa Gatineau area was sufficiently well served by existing French radio services  and to consider licensing one or more of the French language applications  which included a Christian music station  a community radio station and a campus radio station for the Universit  du Qu bec en Outaouais  in addition to or instead of the approved stations      The review ultimately identified a viable frequency for a third station  and CJFO FM launched in        Bell Canada usage based Internet billing Bell Canada usage based billing  On October           the CRTC handed down its final decision on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners  Under the plan which starts within    days  Bell will be able to charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network  and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has  Beyond that set limit  individual users will be charged per gigabyte  depending on the speed of their connections   Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second  for example  will have a monthly allotment of    GB  beyond which Bell will charge       per GB to a maximum of         If a customer uses more than     GB a month  Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of    cents per gigabyte  In May       the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older  unlimited downloading plans  The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers   The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers  Bell appealed both requirements  citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC  which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven  In Thursday s decision  the CRTC rescinded both requirements  thereby giving Bell the go ahead to implement usage based billing  This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market      This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed  According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement  unless the CRTC reverses this decision  the government will use its override power to reverse the decision       Reception of non Canadian services While an exact number has not been determined  thousands of Canadians have purchased and used what they contend to be grey market radio and television services  licensed in the United States but not in Canada  Users of these unlicensed services contend that they are not directly breaking any laws by simply using the equipment  The equipment is usually purchased from an American supplier  although some merchants have attempted to set up shop in Canada  and the services are billed to an American postal address  The advent of online billing and the easy availability of credit card services has made it relatively easy for almost anyone to maintain an account in good standing  regardless of where they actually live  Sec       c  of the Radiocommunication Act creates a prohibition against all decoding of encrypted programming signals  followed by an exception where authorization is received from the person holding the lawful right in Canada to transmit and authorize decoding of the signal  This means receiving the encrypted programming of DishNetwork or DirecTV  even with a grey market subscription  may be construed as unlawful  this remains an unresolved Constitutional issue   Notwithstanding  possession of DishNetwork or DirecTV equipment is not unlawful as provided by The Radiocommuncation Act Section      b   which states   No person shall  except under and in accordance with a radio authorization  install  operate or possess radio apparatus  other than  b a radio apparatus that is capable only of the reception of broadcasting and that is not a distribution undertaking   radio apparatus  means a device or combination of devices intended for  or capable of being used for  radiocommunication    Satellite radio poses a more complicated problem for the CRTC  While an unlicensed satellite dish can often be identified easily  satellite radio receivers are much more compact and can rarely be easily identified  at least not without flagrantly violating provisions against unreasonable search and seizure in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  Some observers argued that this influenced the CRTC s June      decision to ease Canadian content restrictions on satellite radio  see above    Structure The CRTC is run by up to    full time  including the chairman  the vice chairman of broadcasting  and the vice chairman of telecommunications  appointed by the Cabinet for renewable terms of up to five years  However  unlike the more directly political appointees of the American Federal Communications Commission  the CRTC is an arms length regulatory body with more autonomous authority over telecommunications  For example  the CRTC s decisions rely more on a more judiciary process relying on evidence submitted during public consultations  rather than along party lines as the American FCC is prone to do      The CRTC Interconnection Steering Committee  CISC
