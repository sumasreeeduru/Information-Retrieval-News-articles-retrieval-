number    The terms underground press or clandestine press refer to periodicals and publications that are produced without official approval  illegally or against the wishes of a dominant  governmental  religious  or institutional  group   In specific recent  post World War II  Asian  American and Western European context  the term  underground press   has most frequently been employed to refer to the independently published and distributed underground papers associated with the counterculture of the late     s and early     s in India and Bangladesh in Asia  in the United States and Canada in North America  and the United Kingdom and other western nations  It can also refer to the newspapers produced independently in repressive regimes  In German occupied Europe  for example  a thriving underground press operated  usually in association with the Resistance  Other notable examples include the samizdat and bibu a  which operated in the Soviet Union and Poland respectively

invention of the printing press  a widespread underground press emerged in the mid   th century with the clandestine circulation of Calvinist books and broadsides  many of them printed in Geneva     which were secretly smuggled into other nations where the carriers who distributed such literature might face imprisonment  torture or death  Both Protestant and Catholic nations fought the introduction of Calvinism  which with its emphasis on intractable evil made its appeal to alienated  outsider subcultures willing to violently rebel against both church and state   In   th century France  a large illegal underground press of the Enlightenment emerged  circulating anti Royalist  anti clerical and pornographic works in a context where all published works were officially required to be licensed     Starting in the mid   th century an underground press sprang up in many countries around the world for the purpose of circulating the publications of banned Marxist political parties  during the German Nazi occupation of Europe  clandestine presses sponsored and subsidized by the Allies were set up in many of the occupied nations  although it proved nearly impossible to build any sort of effective underground press movement within Germany itself  The French resistance published a large and active underground press that printed over   million newspapers a month  the leading titles were Combat  Lib ration  D fense de la France  and Le Franc Tireur  Each paper was the organ of a separate resistance network  and funds were provided from Allied headquarters in London and distributed to the different papers by resistance leader Jean Moulin     Allied prisoners of war  POWs  published an underground newspaper called POW WOW     In Eastern Europe  also since approximately       underground publications were known by the name samizdat  The countercultural underground press movement of the     s borrowed the name from previous  underground presses  such as the Dutch underground press during the Nazi occupations of the     s   Those predecessors were truly  underground   meaning they were illegal  thus published and distributed covertly  While the countercultural  underground  papers frequently battled with governmental authorities  for the most part they were distributed openly through a network of street vendors  newsstands and head shops  and thus reached a wide audience  The underground press in the     s and     s existed in most countries with high GDP per capita and freedom of the press  similar publications existed in some developing countries and as part of the samizdat movement in the communist states  notably Czechoslovakia  Published as weeklies  monthlies  or  occasionals   and usually associated with left wing politics  they evolved on the one hand into today s alternative weeklies and on the other into zines   In Australia edit  The most prominent underground publication in Australia was a satirical magazine called OZ       to        which initially owed a debt to local university student newspapers such as Honi Soit  University of Sydney  and Tharunka  University of New South Wales   along with the UK magazine Private Eye  The original edition appeared in Sydney on April Fools  Day       and continued sporadically until       Editions published after February      were edited by Richard Walsh  following the departure for the UK of his original co editors Richard Neville and Martin Sharp  who went on to found a British edition  London Oz  in January       In Melbourne Phillip Frazer  founder and editor of pop music magazine Go Set since January       branched out into alternate  underground publications with Revolution in       followed by High Times       to       and The Digger       to            List of Australian underground papers edit  The Digger                The Living Daylights                High Times                OZ Sydney                New Dawn magazine Nexus magazine Revolution                 In the United Kingdom edit  In London  Barry Miles  John Hopkins and others produced International Times from October      which  following legal threats from The Times newspaper was renamed IT  Richard Neville arrived in London from Australia where he had edited Oz       to        He launched a British version       to        which was A   as opposed to IT s broadsheet format   Very quickly  the relaunched Oz shed its more austere satire magazine image and became a mouthpiece of the Underground  It was the most colourful and visually adventurous of the alternative press  sometimes to the point of near illegibility   with designers like Martin Sharp  Other publications followed  such as Friends  later Frendz   based in the Ladbroke Grove area of London  Ink  which was more overtly political  and Gandalf s Garden which espoused the mystic path  Neville published an account of the counterculture called Playpower  in which he described most of the world s underground publications  He also listed many of the regular key topics from those publications including Vietnam  Black Power  politics  police brutality  hippies and lifestyle revolution  drugs  popular music  new society  cinema  theatre  graphics  cartoons  etc  The underground press offered a platform to the socially impotent and mirrored the changing way of life in the UK underground  Police harassment of the British underground in general became commonplace  to the point that in      the police seemed to focus in particular on the apparent source of agitation  the underground press  The police campaign may have had an effect contrary to that which was presumably intended  If anything  according to one or two who were there at the time  it actually made the underground press stronger   It focused attention  stiffened resolve  and tended to confirm that what we were doing was considered dangerous to the establishment   remembered Mick Farren      From April       and for some while later  the police raided the offices of International Times to try  it was alleged  to force the paper out of business  In order to raise money for IT a benefit event was put together   The    Hour Technicolor Dream  Alexandra Palace on    April       On one occasion   in the wake of yet another raid on IT   London s alternative press succeeded in pulling off what was billed as a  reprisal attack  on the police  The paper Black Dwarf published a detailed floor by floor  Guide to Scotland Yard   complete with diagrams  descriptions of locks on particular doors  and snippets of overheard conversation  The anonymous author  or  blue dwarf   as he styled himself  claimed to have perused archive files  and even to have sampled one or two brands of scotch in the Commissioner s office  The London Evening Standard headlined the incident as  Raid on the Yard   A day or two later The Daily Telegraph announced that the prank had resulted in all security passes to the police headquarters having to be withdrawn and then re issued  By the end of the decade  community artists and bands such as Pink Floyd  before they  went commercial    The Deviants  Pink Fairies  Hawkwind  Michael Moorcock and Steve Peregrin Took would arise in a symbiotic co operation with the underground press  The underground press publicised these bands and this made it possible for them to tour and get record deals  The band members travelled around spreading the ethos and the demand for the newspapers and magazines grew and flourished for a while  The flaunting of sexuality within the underground press provoked prosecution  IT was taken to court for publishing small ads for homosexuals  despite the      legalisation of homosexuality between consenting adults in private  importuning remained subject to prosecution  The Oz  School Kids  issue  brought charges against the three Oz editors who were convicted and given jail sentences  This was the first time the Obscene Publications Act      was combined with a moral conspiracy charge  The convictions were  however  overturned on appeal   Local papers edit  Apart from publications such as IT and Oz  both of which had a national circulation  the     s and     s saw the emergence of a whole range of local alternative newspapers  which were usually published monthly  These were largely made possible by the introduction in the     s of offset litho printing  which was much cheaper than traditional typesetting and use of the rotary letterpress   Such local papers included Aberdeen Peoples Press  Alarm  Swansea   Andersonstown News  Belfast   Brighton Voice  Bristol Voice  Feedback  Norwich   Hackney People s Press  Islington Gutter Press  Leeds Other Paper  Response  Earl s Court  London   Sheffield Free Press  and the West Highland Free Press  A      review identified some    such publications around the United Kingdom but estimated that the true number could well have run into hundreds      Such papers were usually published anonymously  for fear of the UK s draconian libel laws  They followed a broad anarchist  libertarian  left wing of the Labour Party  socialist approach but the philosophy of a paper was usually flexible as those responsible for its production came and went  Most papers were run on collective principles   List of UK underground papers edit  Bit Black Dwarf

America edit   East Village Other  April      May         In the United States  the term underground did not mean illegal as it would in other countries  The First Amendment and various court decisions  e g  Near v  Minnesota  give very broad rights to anyone to publish a newspaper or other publication  and severely restrict the government in any effort to close down or censor a private publication  In fact  when censorship attempts are made by government agencies  they are either done in clandestine fashion  to keep it from being known the action is being taken by a government agency  or are usually ordered stopped by the courts when judicial action is taken in response to them  A publication must  in general  be committing a crime  for example  reporters burglarizing someone s office to obtain information about a news item   violating the law in publishing a particular article or issue  printing obscene material  copyright infringement  libel  breaking a non disclosure agreement   directly threatening national security  or causing or potentially causing an imminent emergency  the  clear and present danger  standard  to be ordered stopped or otherwise suppressed  and then usually only the particular offending article or articles in question will be banned  while the newspaper itself is allowed to continue operating and can continue publishing other articles  In the U S  the term underground newspaper generally refers to an independent  and typically smaller  newspaper focusing on unpopular themes or counterculture issues  Typically  these tend to be politically to the left or far left  More narrowly  in the U S  the term  underground newspaper  most often refers to publications of the period            when a sort of boom or craze for local tabloid underground newspapers swept the country in the wake of court decisions making prosecution for obscenity far more difficult  These publications became the voice of the rising New Left and the hippie psychedelic rock and roll counterculture of the     s in America  and a focal point of opposition to the Vietnam War and the draft  In the period            a number of these papers grew more militant and began to openly discuss armed revolution against the state  printing manuals for bombing and urging readers to buy guns  but this new trend of the pacifistic underground press toward violent confrontation soon fell silent after the rise and fall of the Weatherman Underground and the tragic shootings at Kent State  By the end of       with the end of the draft and the winding down of the Vietnam War there was increasingly little reason for the underground press to exist  A number of papers passed out of existence during this time  among the survivors a newer and less polemical view toward middle class values and working within the system emerged   The underground press began to evolve into the socially conscious  life style oriented alternative press that predominates this form of weekly print media in      in North America       In       the landmark Supreme Court decision in Miller v  California re enabled local obscenity prosecutions after a long hiatus  This sounded the death knell for much of the remaining underground press  including underground comix   largely by making the local head shops which stocked underground papers and comix in communities around the country more vulnerable to prosecution  The North American countercultural press of the     s drew inspiration from predecessors that had begun in the     s  such as the Village Voice and Paul Krassner s satirical paper The Realist  Arguably  the first underground newspaper of the     s was the Los Angeles Free Press  founded in      and first published under that name in       In mid       the cooperative Underground Press Syndicate  UPS  was formed at the instigation of Walter Bowart  the publisher of another early paper  the East Village Other  The UPS allowed member papers to freely reprint content from any of the other member papers  Also playing a major role was Liberation News Service  LNS   which was co founded in the summer of      by Ray Mungo and Marshall Bloom      and which  provided coverage of events to which most papers would have otherwise had no access        Among the most prominent of the underground papers were the San Francisco Oracle  San Francisco Express Times  the Berkeley Barb and Berkeley Tribe  Open City  Los Angeles   Fifth Estate  Detroit   Other Scenes  dispatched from various locations around the world by John Wilcock   The Helix  Seattle   Avatar  Boston   The Chicago Seed  The Great Speckled Bird  Atlanta   The Rag  Austin  Texas   Rat  New York City   Space City   Houston  and in Canada  The Georgia Straight  Vancouver  BC   By       virtually every sizable city or college town in North America boasted at least one underground newspaper  During the peak years of the underground press phenomenon there were generally about     papers currently publishing at any given time  A UPS roster published in November      listed    underground papers     of them in the United States  two in England  and one in Canada      Within a few years the number had mushroomed  A      roster  published in Abbie Hoffman s Steal This Book  listed     UPS affiliated papers     were in Canada     in Europe  and the remainder in the United States      According to historian John McMillian  writing in his      book Smoking Typewriters  the underground press  combined readership eventually reached into the millions      The Rag  founded in Austin  Texas  in      by Thorne Dreyer and Carol Neiman  was especially influential  Historian Laurence Leamer called it  one of the few legendary undergrounds       and  according to John McMillian  it served as a model for many papers that followed      The Rag was the sixth member of UPS and the first underground paper in the South and  according to historian Abe Peck  it was the  first undergrounder to represent the participatory democracy  community organizing and synthesis of politics and culture that the New Left of the mid sixties was trying to develop        and Laurence Leamer  in his      book The Paper Revolutionaries  called The Rag  one of the few legendary undergrounds       Gilbert Shelton s legendary Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comic strip began in The Rag and was republished all over the world  Probably the most graphically innovative of the underground papers was the San Francisco Oracle  John Wilcock  a founder of the Underground Press Syndicate  wrote about the Oracle   Its creators are using color the way Lautrec must once have experimented with lithography   testing the resources of the medium to the utmost and producing what almost any experienced newspaperman would tell you was impossible    it is a creative dynamo whose influence will undoubtedly change the look of American publishing        One of the most notorious underground newspapers to join UPS and rallied activists  poets  and artists by giving them uncensored voice was the NOLA Express in New Orleans  Started by Robert Head and Darlene Fife as part of political protests and extending the  mimeo revolution  by protest and freedom of speech poets during the     s  NOLA Express was also a member of COSMEP  Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Publishers  These two affiliations with organizations that were often at cross purposes made NOLA Express one of the most radical and controversial publications of the counterculture movement      Part of the controversy about NOLA Express included graphic photographs and illustrations of which many even in today s society would be banned as pornographic  Charles Bukowski s syndicated column  Notes of a Dirty Old Man  ran in NOLA Express  and Francisco McBride s illustration for the story  The Fuck Machine  was considered sexist  pornographic  and created an uproar  All of this controversy helped to increase the readership and bring attention to the political causes that editors Fife and Head supported      Many of the papers faced official harassment on a regular basis  local police repeatedly raided and busted up the offices of Dallas Notes and jailed editor Stoney Burns on drug charges  charged Atlanta s Great Speckled Bird and others with obscenity  arrested street vendors  and pressured local printers not to print underground papers      In Austin  the regents at the University of Texas sued The Rag to prevent circulation on campus but the ACLU successfully defended the paper s First Amendment rights before the U S  Supreme Court  In an apparent attempt to shut down The Spectator in Bloomington  Indiana  editor James Retherford was briefly imprisoned for alleged violations of the Selective Service laws  his conviction was overturned and the prosecutors were rebuked by a federal judge      The offices of Houston s Space City  were bombed and its windows repeatedly shot out  similar drive by shootings  firebombings  break ins and trashings were carried out on the offices of many underground papers around the country  fortunately without causing any fatalities  In Houston as in many other cities the attackers  never identified  were suspected of being off duty military or police personnel  or members of the Ku Klux Klan or Minuteman organizations      Some of the most violent attacks were carried out against the underground press in San Diego  In      the San Diego Union reported that the attacks in      and      had been carried out by a right wing paramilitary group calling itself the Secret Army Organization  which had ties to the local office of the FBI      During this period there was also a widespread high school underground press movement circulating unauthorized student published tabloids and mimeographed sheets at hundreds of high schools around the US  Most of these papers put out only a few issues  running off a few hundred copies of each and circulating them only at one local school  although there was one system wide antiwar high school underground paper produced in New York in      with a        copy press run  And Houston s Little Red Schoolhouse  a citywide underground paper published by high school students  was founded in       For a time in           the high school underground press had its own press services  FRED  run by Clark Kissinger of SDS  with its base in Chicago schools  and HIPS  High School Independent Press Service  produced by students working out of Liberation News Service headquarters and aimed primarily but not exclusively at New York City schools   These services typically produced a weekly packet of articles and features mailed to subscribing papers around the country  HIPS reported    subscribing papers      In      a survey of     high schools in Southern California found that     reported student underground press activity in their school      The GI underground press in America produced a few hundred titles during the Vietnam War  some produced by antiwar GI coffeehouses  and many of them small  crudely produced  low circulation mimeographed  zines  written by a draftee editor opposed to the war and circulated locally off base  Three or four GI underground papers had large scale  national distribution of more than        copies including thousands of copies mailed to GIs overseas  These papers were produced with the support of civilian anti war activists  and had to be disguised to be sent through the mail into Vietnam  where soldiers distributing or even possessing them might be subject to harassment  disciplinary action or arrest  The idea of smuggling a full size printing press into South Vietnam was mooted but determined to be too dangerous to attempt  As an alternative  a few GIs based in South Vietnam were issued small kits to enable them to produce little hektograph type zines  The boom in the underground press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing  which made it possible to print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars  which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit  Paper was cheap  and many printing firms around the country had over expanded during the     s and had excess capacity on their offset web presses  which could be negotiated for at bargain rates        Space City   April          Art by Bill Narum  Most papers operated on a shoestring budget  pasting up camera ready copy on layout sheets on the editor s kitchen table  with labor performed by unpaid  non union volunteers  Typesetting costs  which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers  were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted up by hand  As one observer commented with only slight hyperbole  students were financing the publication of these papers out of their lunch money  According to Louis Menand  writing in The New Yorker  the underground press movement in the United States was  one of the most spontaneous and aggressive growths in publishing history       But  the underground press phenomenon proved short lived  By       many underground papers had folded  at which point the Underground Press Syndicate acknowledged the passing of the undergrounds and renamed itself the Alternative Press Syndicate  That organization soon collapsed  to be supplanted by the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies  During the     s and     s  there were also a number of left political periodicals with some of the same concerns of the underground press  Some of these periodicals joined the Underground Press Syndicate to gain services such as microfilming  advertising  and the free exchange of articles and newspapers  Examples include The Black Panther  the paper of the Black Panther Party  Oakland  California   and The Guardian  New York City  both of which had national distribution  The U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  conducted surveillance and disruption activities on the underground press in the United States  including a campaign to destroy the alternative agency Liberation News Service  As part of its COINTELPRO designed to discredit and infiltrate radical New Left groups  the FBI also launched phony underground newspapers such as the Armageddon News at Indiana University Bloomington  The Longhorn Tale at the University of Texas at Austin  and the Rational Observer at American University in Washington  D C  The FBI also ran the Pacific International News Service in San Francisco  the Chicago Midwest News  and the New York Press Service  Many of these organizations consisted of little more than a post office box and a letterhead  designed to enable the FBI to receive exchange copies of underground press publications and send undercover observers to underground press gatherings  The Georgia Straight outlived the underground movement  evolving into an alternative weekly still published today  Fifth Estate survives as an anarchist magazine  The Rag   which published for    years in Austin               was revived in      as an online publication  The Rag Blog  which now has a wide following in the progressive blogosphere and whose contributors include many veterans of the original underground press  Given the nature of alternative journalism as a subculture  some staff members from underground newspapers became staff on the newer alternative weeklies  even though there was seldom institutional continuity with management or ownership  An example is the transition in Denver from the underground Chinook  to Straight Creek Journal  to Westword      an alternative weekly still in publication  Some underground and alternative reporters  cartoonists  and artists moved on to work in corporate media or in academia   List of U S  underground press papers edit  More than a thousand underground newspapers were published in the United States during the Vietnam War  The following is a short list of the more widely circulated  longer lived and notable titles  For a longer  more comprehensive listing sorted by states  see the long list of underground

quartet  i e  Shakti Chattopadhyay  Malay Roy Choudhury  Samir Roychoudhury and Debi Roy  alias Haradhon Dhara   during the     s in Kolkata  India  Due to their involvement in this avant garde cultural movement  the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government  They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting      This movement is characterized by expression of closeness to nature and sometimes by tenets of Gandhianism and Proudhonianism  Although it originated at Patna  Bihar and was initially based in Kolkata  it had participants spread over North Bengal  Tripura and Benares  According to Dr  Shankar Bhattacharya  Dean at Assam University  as well as Aryanil Mukherjee  editor of Kaurab Literary Periodical  the movement influenced Allen Ginsberg as much as it influenced American poetry
