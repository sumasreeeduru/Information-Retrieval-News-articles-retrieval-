smoke signals and drums  Talking drums were used by natives in Africa  and smoke signals in North America and China  Contrary to what one might think  these systems were often used to do more than merely announce the presence of a military camp        In Rabbinical Judaism a signal was given by means of kerchiefs or flags at intervals along the way back to the high priest to indicate the goat  for Azazel  had been pushed from the cliff  Homing pigeons have occasionally been used throughout history by different cultures  Pigeon post had Persian roots  and was later used by the Romans to aid their military     Greek hydraulic semaphore systems were used as early as the  th century BC   The hydraulic semaphores  which worked with water filled vessels and visual signals  functioned as optical telegraphs  However  they could only utilize a very limited range of pre determined messages  and as with all such optical telegraphs could only be deployed during good visibility conditions       Code of letters and symbols for Chappe telegraph  Rees s Cyclopaedia  During the Middle Ages  chains of beacons were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal  Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information  so the meaning of the message such as  the enemy has been sighted  had to be agreed upon in advance  One notable instance of their use was during the Spanish Armada  when a beacon chain relayed a signal from Plymouth to London that signaled the arrival of the Spanish warships     French engineer Claude Chappe began working on visual telegraphy in       using pairs of  clocks  whose hands pointed at different symbols  These did not prove quite viable at long distances  and Chappe revised his model to use two sets of jointed wooden beams  Operators moved the beams using cranks and wires     He built his first telegraph line between Lille and Paris  followed by a line from Strasbourg to Paris  In       a Swedish engineer  Abraham Edelcrantz built a quite different system from Stockholm to Drottningholm  As opposed to Chappe s system which involved pulleys rotating beams of wood  Edelcrantz s system relied only upon shutters and was therefore faster     However  semaphore as a communication system suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers often at intervals of only ten to thirty kilometres  six to nineteen miles   As a result  the last commercial line was abandoned in           Electrical telegraph edit  Main articles  Electrical telegraph and Transatlantic telegraph cable  Stock telegraph ticker machine by Thomas Edison Experiments on communication with electricity  initially unsuccessful  started in about       Scientists including Laplace  Amp re  and Gauss were involved  An early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an  electrochemical  telegraph created by the German physician  anatomist and inventor Samuel Thomas von S mmerring in       based on an earlier  less robust design of      by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo     Both their designs employed multiple wires  up to     in order to visually represent almost all Latin letters and numerals  Thus  messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers  in von S mmerring s design   with each of the telegraph receiver s wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid  An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message  at the recipient s end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence  releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral  The telegraph receiver s operator would visually observe the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message  albeit at a very low baud rate     The principal disadvantage to the system was its prohibitive cost  due to having to manufacture and string up the multiple wire circuits it employed  as opposed to the single wire  with ground return  used by later telegraphs  The first working telegraph was built by Francis Ronalds in      and used static electricity      Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke patented a five needle  six wire system  which entered commercial use in           It used the deflection of needles to represent messages and started operating over twenty one kilometres  thirteen miles  of the Great Western Railway on   April       Both Wheatstone and Cooke viewed their device as  an improvement to the  existing  electromagnetic telegraph  not as a new device  On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean  Samuel Morse developed a version of the electrical telegraph which he demonstrated on   September       Alfred Vail saw this demonstration and joined Morse to develop the register a telegraph terminal that integrated a logging device for recording messages to paper tape  This was demonstrated successfully over three miles  five kilometres  on   January      and eventually over forty miles  sixty four kilometres  between Washington  D C  and Baltimore on    May       The patented invention proved lucrative and by      telegraph lines in the United States spanned over        miles         kilometres       Morse s most important technical contribution to this telegraph was the simple and highly efficient Morse Code  co developed with Vail  which was an important advance over Wheatstone s more complicated and expensive system  and required just two wires  The communications efficiency of the Morse Code preceded that of the Huffman code in digital communications by over     years  but Morse and Vail developed the code purely empirically  with shorter codes for more frequent letters  The submarine cable across the English Channel  wire coated in gutta percha  was laid in           Transatlantic cables installed in      and      only operated for a few days or weeks  carried messages of greeting back and forth between James Buchanan and Queen Victoria  before they failed      The project to lay a replacement line was delayed for five years by the American Civil War  The first successful transatlantic telegraph cable was completed on    July       allowing continuous transatlantic telecommunication for the first time   Telephone edit  Main articles  Invention of the telephone and History of the telephone  The master telephone patent          granted to Bell  March         The electric telephone was invented in the     s  based on earlier work with harmonic  multi signal  telegraphs  The first commercial telephone services were set up in      and      on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of New Haven  Connecticut in the US and London  England in the UK  Alexander Graham Bell held the master patent for the telephone that was needed for such services in both countries      All other patents for electric telephone devices and features flowed from this master patent  Credit for the invention of the electric telephone has been frequently disputed  and new controversies over the issue have arisen from time to time  As with other great inventions such as radio  television  the light bulb  and the digital computer  there were several inventors who did pioneering experimental work on voice transmission over a wire  who then improved on each other s ideas  However  the key innovators were Alexander Graham Bell and Gardiner Greene Hubbard  who created the first telephone company  the Bell Telephone Company in the United States  which later evolved into American Telephone   Telegraph  AT T   at times the world s largest phone company  Telephone technology grew quickly after the first commercial services emerged  with inter city lines being built and telephone exchanges in every major city of the United States by the mid     s              The first transcontinental telephone call occurred on January            Despite this  transatlantic voice communication remained impossible for customers until January         when a connection was established using radio      However no cable connection existed until TAT   was inaugurated on September          providing    telephone circuits      In       Bell and co inventor Charles Sumner Tainter conducted the world s first wireless telephone call via modulated lightbeams projected by photophones  The scientific principles of their invention would not be utilized for several decades  when they were first deployed in military and fiber optic communications  The first transatlantic telephone cable  which incorporated hundreds of electronic amplifiers  was not operational until       only six years before the first commercial telecommunications satellite  Telstar  was launched into space       Radio and television edit  Main articles  History of radio  History of television  and History of broadcasting Over several years starting in       the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi worked on adapting the newly discovered phenomenon of radio waves to telecommunication  building the first wireless telegraphy system using them       In December       he established wireless communication between St  John s  Newfoundland and Poldhu  Cornwall  England   earning him a Nobel Prize in Physics  which he shared with Karl Braun  in           In       Reginald Fessenden was able to wirelessly transmit a human voice  Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Bengali physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose during            when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to    GHz in his experiments      He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves      when he patented the radio crystal detector in               In       Japanese engineer Kenjiro Takayanagi began a research program on electronic television  In       he demonstrated a CRT television with thermal electron emission      In       he demonstrated a CRT television with    line resolution      the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver      In       he increased the television resolution to     lines  which was unrivaled until           In       he was the first to transmit human faces in half tones on television  influencing the later work of Vladimir K  Zworykin      On March           Scottish inventor John Logie Baird publicly demonstrated the transmission of moving silhouette pictures at the London department store Selfridge s  Baird s system relied upon the fast rotating Nipkow disk  and thus it became known as the mechanical television  In October       Baird was successful in obtaining moving pictures with halftone shades  which were by most accounts the first true television pictures       This led to a public demonstration of the improved device on    January      again at Selfridges  His invention formed the basis of semi experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning September               For most of the twentieth century televisions used the cathode ray tube  CRT  invented by Karl Braun  Such a television was produced by Philo Farnsworth  who demonstrated crude silhouette images to his family in Idaho on September              Farnsworth s device would compete with the concurrent work of Kalman Tihanyi and Vladimir Zworykin   Though the execution of the device was not yet what everyone hoped it could be  it earned Farnsworth a small production company  In       he gave the first public demonstration of the television at Philadelphia s Franklin Institute and opened his own broadcasting station      Zworykin s camera  based on Tihanyi s Radioskop  which later would be known as the Iconoscope  had the backing of the influential Radio Corporation of America  RCA    In the United States  court action between Farnsworth and RCA would resolve in Farnsworth s favour      John Logie Baird switched from mechanical television and became a pioneer of colour television using cathode ray tubes      After mid century the spread of coaxial cable and microwave radio relay allowed television networks to spread across even large countries   Semiconductor era edit  The modern period of telecommunication history from      onwards is referred to as the semiconductor era  due to the wide adoption of semiconductor devices in telecommunication technology  The development of transistor technology and the semiconductor industry enabled significant advances in telecommunication technology  led to the price of telecommunications services declining significantly  and led to a transition away from state owned narrowband circuit switched networks to private broadband packet switched networks  In turn  this led to a significant increase in the total number of telephone subscribers  reaching nearly   billion users worldwide by the end of the   th century      The development of metal oxide semiconductor  MOS  large scale integration  LSI  technology  information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications  There was a rapid growth of the telecommunications industry towards the end of the   th century  primarily due to the introduction of digital signal processing in wireless communications  driven by the development of low cost  very large scale integration  VLSI  RF CMOS  radio frequency complementary MOS  technology       Transistors edit  Main articles  History of the transistor  MOSFET  and Edholm s law Further information  RF CMOS and LDMOS The development of transistor technology has been fundamental to modern electronic telecommunication              Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field effect transistor in       but it was not possible to actually construct a working device at that time      The first working transistor  a point contact transistor  was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs in           The MOSFET  metal oxide silicon field effect transistor   also known as the MOS transistor  was later invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in                   It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass produced for a wide range of uses      The MOSFET is the building block or  workhorse  of the information revolution and the information age          and the most widely manufactured device in history          MOS technology  including MOS integrated circuits and power MOSFETs  drives the communications infrastructure of modern telecommunication              According to Edholm s law  the bandwidth of telecommunication networks has been doubling every    months      Advances in MOS technology  including MOSFET scaling  increasing transistor counts at an exponential pace  as predicted by Moore s law   has been the most important contributing factor in the rapid rise of bandwidth in telecommunications networks      By the early     s  MOSFETs were used in a wide range of telecommunications equipment  such as crosspoint switches  mail sorter machines  mobile radio  modems  multimeters  multiplexers  push button signal receivers  teleprinters  display devices such as television receivers  and telephone sets such as payphones and push button telephones      By the     s  CMOS  complementary MOS  VLSI  very large scale integration  technology was widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges  private branch exchanges  PBX  and key telephone systems  KTS   digital transmission applications such as digital loop carriers  pair gain multiplexers  telephone loop extenders  integrated services digital network  ISDN  terminals  cordless telephones and cell phones  and applications such as speech recognition equipment  voice data storage  voice mail and digital tapeless answering machines      By the early   st century  MOSFETs were used in all microprocessors  memory chips  and telecommunication circuits      as well as most essential elements of wireless telecommunications  such as mobile devices  transceivers  base station modules  routers and RF power amplifiers       Videotelephony edit  Main article  History of videotelephony  The      AT T Mod II Picturephone  the result of decades long R D at a cost of over     M  The development of videotelephony involved the historical development of several technologies which enabled the use of live video in addition to voice telecommunications  The concept of videotelephony was first popularized in the late     s in both the United States and Europe  although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered  This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone  or videophone  and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields  notably electrical telegraphy  telephony  radio  and television  The development of the crucial video technology first started in the latter half of the     s in the United Kingdom and the United States  spurred notably by John Logie Baird and AT T s Bell Labs  This occurred in part  at least by AT T  to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone  A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications  However video technology was to be deployed in analog television broadcasting long before it could become practical or popular for videophones  Videotelephony developed in parallel with conventional voice telephone systems from the mid to late   th century  Only in the late   th century with the advent of  powerful video codecs and high speed broadband did it become a practical technology for regular use  With the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet  it became widespread through the use of videoconferencing and webcams  which frequently utilize Internet telephony  and in business  where telepresence technology has helped reduce the need to travel  Practical digital videotelephony was only made possible with advances in video compression  due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video  To achieve Video Graphics Array  VGA  quality video     p resolution and     colors  with raw uncompressed video  it would require a bandwidth of over    Mbps      The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the discrete cosine transform  DCT           The DCT  a form of lossy compression  was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in           The DCT algorithm became the basis for the first practical video coding standard that was useful for videoconferencing  H      standardised by the ITU T in            Satellite edit  Main articles  Communications satellite  Satellite phone  Satellite radio  Satellite television  and Satellite Internet access The first U S  satellite to relay communications was Project SCORE in       which used a tape recorder to store and forward voice messages  It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U S  President Dwight D  Eisenhower  In      NASA launched an Echo satellite  the     foot     m  aluminized PET film balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications   Courier  B  built by Philco  also launched in       was the world s first active repeater satellite  Satellites these days are used for many applications such as GPS  television  internet and telephone  Telstar was the first active  direct relay commercial communications satellite  Belonging to AT T as part of a multi national agreement between AT T  Bell Telephone Laboratories  NASA  the British General Post Office  and the French National PTT  Post Office  to develop satellite communications  it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on July           the first privately sponsored space launch  Relay   was launched on December           and became the first satellite to broadcast across the Pacific on November               The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony  The fixed Public Switched Telephone Network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an earth station  where they are then transmitted a receiving satellite dish via a geostationary satellite in Earth orbit   Improvements in submarine communications cables  through the use of fiber optics  caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late   th century  but they still exclusively service remote islands such as Ascension Island  Saint Helena  Diego Garcia  and Easter Island  where no submarine cables are in service  There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent  for example Antarctica  plus large regions of Australia  South America  Africa  Northern Canada  China  Russia and Greenland  After commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites  a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in       including mobile satellite phones  satellite radio  satellite television and satellite Internet access  The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the     s as the pricing for commercial satellite transponder channels continued to drop significantly  Realization

Philippe Binant       Computer networks and the Internet edit  Main articles  Computer  Computer network  and History of the Internet On September           George Stibitz was able to transmit problems using teletype to his Complex Number Calculator in New York City and receive the computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire      This configuration of a centralized computer or mainframe with remote dumb terminals remained popular throughout the     s  However it was not until the     s that researchers started to investigate packet switching a technology that would allow chunks of data to be sent to different computers  without first passing through a centralized mainframe  A four node network emerged on December         between the University of California  Los Angeles  the Stanford Research Institute  the University of Utah and the University of California  Santa Barbara  This network would become ARPANET  which by      would consist of     nodes      In June       the first non US node was added to the network belonging to Norway s NORSAR project  This was shortly followed by a node in London      ARPANET s development centred on the Request for Comment process and on April          RFC   was published  This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet and many of the protocols the Internet relies upon today were specified through this process  The first Transmission Control Protocol  TCP  specification  RFC      Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program   was written by Vinton Cerf  Yogen Dalal  and Carl Sunshine  and published in December       It coined the term  Internet  as a shorthand for internetworking      In September       RFC     introduced the Internet Protocol v   IPv    This established the TCP IP protocol  which much of the Internet relies upon today  The User Datagram Protocol  UDP   a more relaxed transport protocol that  unlike TCP  did not guarantee the orderly delivery of packets  was submitted on    August      as RFC      An e mail protocol  SMTP  was introduced in August      by RFC     and   HTTP http       permanent dead link    a protocol that would make the hyperlinked Internet possible was introduced in May      by RFC       However  not all important developments were made through the Request for Comment process  Two popular link protocols for local area networks  LANs  also appeared in the     s  A patent for the Token Ring protocol was filed by Olof S derblom on October               And a paper on the Ethernet protocol was published by Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs in the July      issue of Communications of the ACM      The Ethernet protocol had been inspired by the ALOHAnet protocol which had been developed by electrical engineering researchers at the University of Hawaii  Internet access became widespread late in the century  using the old telephone and television networks   Digital telephone technology edit  Main article  Digital telephony Further information  Push button telephone and Speech coding The rapid development and wide adoption of pulse code modulation  PCM  digital telephony was enabled by metal oxide semiconductor  MOS  technology      MOS technology was initially overlooked by Bell because they did not find it practical for analog telephone applications          MOS technology eventually became practical for telephone applications with the MOS mixed signal integrated circuit  which combines analog and digital signal processing on a single chip  developed by former Bell engineer David A  Hodges with Paul R  Gray at UC Berkeley in the early     s      In       Hodges and Gray worked with R E  Suarez to develop MOS switched capacitor  SC  circuit technology  which they used to develop the digital to analog converter  DAC  chip  using MOSFETs and MOS capacitors for data conversion  This was followed by the analog to digital converter  ADC  chip  developed by Gray and J  McCreary in           MOS SC circuits led to the development of PCM codec filter chips in the late     s          The silicon gate CMOS  complementary MOS  PCM codec filter chip  developed by Hodges and W C  Black in           has since been the industry standard for digital telephony          By the     s  telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network  PSTN  had been largely digitized with very large scale integration  VLSI  CMOS PCM codec filters  widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges and data transmission

impractically high memory  storage and bandwidth requirements of uncompressed media      The most important compression technique is the discrete cosine transform  DCT       a lossy compression algorithm that was first proposed as an image compression technique by Nasir Ahmed at the University of Texas in           The DCT algorithm was the basis for the first practical video coding format  H      in           It was followed by more DCT based video coding standards  most notably the MPEG video formats from      onwards      The JPEG image format  also based on the DCT algorithm  was introduced in           The development of the modified discrete cosine transform  MDCT  algorithm led to the MP  audio coding format in           and the Advanced Audio Coding  AAC  format in

wireless computer networks      cellular networks  the wireless Internet  and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections      The wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio

technology  the key component of the RF technology that enables digital wireless networks  has been central to this revolution      The invention of the MOSFET by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in      led to the development of power MOSFET technology      Hitachi developed the vertical power MOSFET in           and then the lateral diffused metal oxide semiconductor  LDMOS  in           RF CMOS  radio frequency CMOS  integrated circuit technology was later developed by Asad Abidi at UCLA in the late     s      By the     s  RF CMOS integrated circuits were widely adopted as RF circuits      while discrete MOSFET  power MOSFET and LDMOS  devices were widely adopted as RF power amplifiers  which led to the development and proliferation of digital wireless networks          Most of the essential elements of modern wireless networks are built from MOSFETs  including base station modules  routers      telecommunication circuits      and radio transceivers      MOSFET
