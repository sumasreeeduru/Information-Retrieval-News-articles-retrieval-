of       in Llanwnda church  rescued from the hands of French invaders in           The language of the Welsh developed from the language of Britons      The emergence of Welsh was not instantaneous and clearly identifiable  Instead  the shift occurred over a long period of time  with some historians claiming that it had happened by as late as the  th century  with a watershed moment being that proposed by linguist Kenneth H  Jackson  the Battle of Dyrham  a military battle between the West Saxons and the Britons in     AD      which split the South Western British from direct overland contact with the Welsh  Four periods are identified in the history of Welsh  with rather indistinct boundaries  Primitive Welsh  Old Welsh  Middle Welsh  and Modern Welsh  The period immediately following the language s emergence is sometimes referred to as Primitive Welsh      followed by the Old Welsh period   which is generally considered to stretch from the beginning of the  th century to sometime during the   th century      The Middle Welsh period is considered to have lasted from then until the   th century  when the Modern Welsh period began  which in turn is divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh  The word Welsh is a descendant  via Old English wealh  wielisc  of the Proto Germanic word  Walhaz  which was derived from the name of the Celtic people known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer to speakers of Celtic languages  and then indiscriminately to the people of the Western Roman Empire  In Old English the term went through semantic narrowing  coming to refer to either Britons in particular or  in some contexts  slaves      The plural form W alas evolved into the name for their territory  Wales      The modern names for various Romance speaking people in Continental Europe  e g  Walloons  Valaisans  Vlachs Wallachians  and W osi  the Polish name for Italians  have a similar etymology      The Welsh term for the language  Cymraeg  descends from the Brythonic word  combrogi  Error    Lang    unrecognized language tag  brit  help   meaning  compatriots  or  fellow countrymen        Origins edit  See also  Celtic languages   Classification  The      Welsh Bible Welsh evolved from Common Brittonic  the Celtic language spoken by the ancient Celtic Britons  Classified as Insular Celtic  the British language probably arrived in Britain during the Bronze Age or Iron Age and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the Firth of Forth      During the Early Middle Ages the British language began to fragment due to increased dialect differentiation  thus evolving into Welsh and the other Brittonic languages  It is not clear when Welsh became distinct              Linguist Kenneth H  Jackson has suggested that the evolution in syllabic structure and sound pattern was complete by around AD      and labelled the period between then and about AD      Primitive Welsh       This Primitive Welsh may have been spoken in both Wales and the Hen Ogledd   Old North     the Brittonic speaking areas of what are now northern England and southern Scotland   and therefore may have been the ancestor of Cumbric as well as Welsh  Jackson  however  believed that the two varieties were already distinct by that time      The earliest Welsh poetry   that attributed to the Cynfeirdd or  Early Poets    is generally considered to date to the Primitive Welsh period  However  much of this poetry was supposedly composed in the Hen Ogledd  raising further questions about the dating of the material and language in which it was originally composed      This discretion stems from the fact that Cumbric was widely believed to have been the language used in Hen Ogledd  An  th century inscription in Tywyn shows the language already dropping inflections in the declension of nouns      Janet Davies proposed that the origins of Welsh language were much less definite  in The Welsh Language  A History  she proposes that Welsh may have been around even earlier than     AD  This is evidenced by the dropping of final syllables from Brittonic   bardos  poet  became bardd  and  abona  river  became afon      Though both Davies and Jackson cite minor changes in syllable structure and sounds as evidence for the creation of Old Welsh  Davies suggests it may be more appropriate to refer to this derivative language as Lingua Britannica rather than characterising it as a new language altogether   Primitive Welsh edit  The argued dates for the period of  Primitive Welsh  are widely debated  with some historians  suggestions differing by hundreds of years   Old Welsh edit  Main article  Old Welsh The next main period is Old Welsh  Hen Gymraeg   th to   th centuries   poetry from both Wales and Scotland has been preserved in this form of the language  As Germanic and Gaelic colonisation of Britain proceeded  the Brittonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England  speaking Cumbric  and those in the southwest  speaking what would become Cornish  and so the languages diverged  Both the works of Aneirin  Canu Aneirin  c       and the Book of Taliesin  Canu Taliesin  were written during this era   Middle Welsh edit  Main article  Middle Welsh Middle Welsh  Cymraeg Canol  is the label attached to the Welsh of the   th to   th centuries  of which much more remains than for any earlier period  This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the Mabinogion  although the tales themselves are certainly much older  It is also the language of the existing Welsh law manuscripts

Salesbury in           and the complete Bible by William Morgan in           Modern Welsh is subdivided into Early Modern Welsh and Late Modern Welsh      Early Modern Welsh ran from the   th century through to the end of the   th century      and the Late Modern Welsh period roughly dates from the   th century onwards  Contemporary Welsh differs greatly from the Welsh of the   th century  but they are similar enough for a fluent Welsh speaker to have little trouble understanding it  During the Modern Welsh period there has been a decline in the popularity of the Welsh language  the number of Welsh speakers declined to the point at which there was concern that the language would become extinct  Welsh government processes and legislation have worked to increase the proliferation of the Welsh language  e g  through education   Geographic distribution edit  Wales edit   The proportion of respondents in the      census who said they could speak Welsh Welsh has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history  but by      it had become a minority language  spoken by      percent of the population      While this decline continued over the following decades  the language did not die out  By the start of the   st century  numbers began to increase once more  at least partly as a result of the increase in Welsh medium education          The      Welsh Language Use Survey showed that      percent of the population of Wales spoke Welsh      compared with      percent in the      Census  and      percent in      Census  The      Census  however  showed a slight decline to          or    per cent of the population      The census also showed a  big drop  in the number of speakers in the Welsh speaking heartlands  with the number dropping to under    percent in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire for the first time      However  according to the Welsh Language Use Survey in             percent of people aged three and over were able to speak Welsh      The Annual Population Survey by the Office for National Statistics estimated that  for the year ending in June                or      percent of the population of Wales aged   and over  were able to speak the language  implying a possible increase in the prevalence of the Welsh language since the      census  Similarly  the National Survey for Wales  conducted by Welsh Government  has also tended to have a higher percentage of Welsh speakers than the Census  with the most recent results for           suggesting that    percent of the population aged   and over were able to speak Welsh  with an additional    percent noting that they had some Welsh speaking ability  Historically  large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh      Over the course of the   th century this monolingual population  all but disappeared   but a small percentage remained at the time of the      census      Most Welsh speaking people in Wales also speak English  while in Chubut Province  Argentina  most speakers can speak Spanish   see Y Wladfa   However  many Welsh speaking people are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English  A speaker s choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context  even within a single discourse  known in linguistics as code switching       Welsh speakers are largely concentrated in the north and west of Wales  principally Gwynedd  Conwy  Denbighshire  Sir Ddinbych   Anglesey  Ynys M n   Carmarthenshire  Sir G r   north Pembrokeshire  Sir Benfro   Ceredigion  parts of Glamorgan  Morgannwg   and north west and extreme south west Powys  However  first language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales       Outside Wales edit  The rest of the UK edit  Welsh speaking communities persisted well into the modern period across the border in England  Archenfield was still Welsh enough in the time of Elizabeth I for the Bishop of Hereford to be made responsible  together with the four Welsh bishops  for the translation of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh  Welsh was still commonly spoken there in the first half of the   th century  and churchwardens  notices were put up in both Welsh and English until about           Alexander John Ellis in the     s identified a small part of Shropshire as still then speaking Welsh  with the  Celtic Border  passing from Llanymynech through Oswestry to Chirk      The number of Welsh speaking people in the rest of Britain has not yet been counted for statistical purposes  In       the Welsh language television channel S C published the results of a survey into the numbers of people who spoke or understood Welsh  which estimated that there were around         Welsh speaking people living in England  about        of them in the Greater London area      The Welsh Language Board  on the basis of an analysis of the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study  estimated there were         Welsh speaking people in England  and another thousand in Scotland and Northern Ireland      In the      Census        people in England gave Welsh in answer to the question  What is your main language       The Office for National Statistics subsequently published a census glossary of terms to support the release of results from the census  including their definition of  main language  as referring to  first or preferred language   though that wording was not in the census questionnaire itself           The wards in England with the most people giving Welsh as their main language were the Liverpool wards of Central and Greenbank and Oswestry South      The wards of Oswestry South          Oswestry East         and St Oswald         had the highest percentage of residents giving Welsh as their main language  The Census also revealed that       wards in England  or     of the total number  contained at least one resident whose main language is Welsh  In terms of the regions of England  North West England          London         and the West Midlands         had the highest number of people noting Welsh as their main language      In the      Census        people aged three and over in Scotland noted that Welsh was a language  other than English  that they used at home       Argentina edit  It is believed that there are as many as       speakers of Patagonian Welsh       Australia edit  In response to the question  Does the person speak a language other than English at home   in the      Australian Census        people noted that they spoke Welsh       Canada edit  In the      Canadian Census        people reported Welsh as their first language       United States edit  The American Community Survey           noted that       people aged   years and over in the United States spoke

Cardiff Airport  Although Welsh is a minority language  support for it grew during the second half of the   th century  along with the rise of organisations such as the nationalist political party Plaid Cymru from      and Welsh Language Society from       The Welsh Language Act      and the Government of Wales Act      provide that the Welsh and English languages be treated equally in the public sector  as far as is reasonable and practicable  Each public body is required to prepare for approval a Welsh Language Scheme  which indicates its commitment to the equality of treatment principle  This is sent out in draft form for public consultation for a three month period  whereupon comments on it may be incorporated into a final version  It requires the final approval of the now defunct Welsh Language Board  Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg   Thereafter  the public body is charged with implementing and fulfilling its obligations under the Welsh Language Scheme  The list of other public bodies which have to prepare Schemes could be added to by initially the Secretary of State for Wales  from            by way of statutory instrument  Subsequent to the forming of the National Assembly for Wales in       the Government Minister responsible for the Welsh language can and has passed statutory instruments naming public bodies who have to prepare Schemes  Neither the      Act nor secondary legislation made under it covers the private sector  although some organisations  notably banks and some railway companies  provide some of their information in Welsh          On   December       the Welsh Assembly unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales          On   February      this measure  the Proposed Welsh Language  Wales  Measure       was passed and received Royal Assent  thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales  The measure   confirms the official status of the Welsh language creates a new system of placing duties on bodies to provide services through the medium of Welsh creates a Welsh Language Commissioner with strong enforcement powers to protect the rights of Welsh speaking people to access services through the medium of Welsh establishes a Welsh Language Tribunal gives individuals and bodies the right to appeal decisions made in relation to the provision of services through the medium of Welsh creates a Welsh Language Partnership Council to advise Government on its strategy in relation to the Welsh language allows for an official investigation by the Welsh Language Commissioner of instances where there is an attempt to interfere with the freedom of Welsh speaking people to use the language with one another     The measure requires public bodies and some private companies to provide services in Welsh  The Welsh government s Minister for Heritage at the time  Alun Ffred Jones  said   The Welsh language is a source of great pride for the people of Wales  whether they speak it or not  and I am delighted that this measure has now become law  I am very proud to have steered legislation through the Assembly which confirms the official status of the Welsh language  which creates a strong advocate for Welsh speakers and will improve the quality and quantity of services available through the medium of Welsh  I believe that everyone who wants to access services in the Welsh language should be able to do so  and that is what this government has worked towards  This legislation is an important and historic step forward for the language  its speakers and for the nation       The measure was not welcomed warmly by all supporters  Bethan Williams  chairman of the Welsh Language Society  gave a mixed response to the move  saying   Through this measure we have won official status for the language and that has been warmly welcomed  But there was a core principle missing in the law passed by the Assembly before Christmas  It doesn t give language rights to the people of Wales in every aspect of their lives  Despite that  an amendment to that effect was supported by    Assembly Members from three different parties  and that was a significant step forward       On   October       Meri Huws  Chair of the Welsh Language Board  was appointed the new Welsh Language Commissioner      She released a statement that she was  delighted  to have been appointed to the  hugely important role   adding   I look forward to working with the Welsh Government and organisations in Wales in developing the new system of standards  I will look to build on the good work that has been done by the Welsh Language Board and others to strengthen the Welsh language and ensure that it continues to thrive   First Minister Carwyn Jones said that Meri would act as a champion for the Welsh language  though some had concerns over her appointment  Plaid Cymru spokeswoman Bethan Jenkins said   I have concerns about the transition from Meri Huws s role from the Welsh Language Board to the language commissioner  and I will be asking the Welsh government how this will be successfully managed  We must be sure that there is no conflict of interest  and that the Welsh Language Commissioner can demonstrate how she will offer the required fresh approach to this new role   Ms Huws started her role as the Welsh Language Commissioner on   April       Local councils and the National Assembly for Wales use Welsh  issuing Welsh versions of their literature  to varying degrees  Road signs in Wales are in Welsh and English      Since       the teaching of Welsh has been compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age     this has had an effect in stabilising and reversing the decline in the language      The wording on currency is only in English  except in the legend on Welsh pound coins dated            and       which circulate in all parts of the UK  The wording is Pleidiol wyf i m gwlad   Welsh for  True am I to my country    and derives from the national anthem of Wales  Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau  Some shops employ bilingual signage  Welsh sometimes appears on product packaging or instructions  The UK government has ratified the European

one third of the          public funding it needed      There is a Welsh language online news service which publishes news stories in Welsh called Golwg           degree  view     In education edit  Main article  Welsh medium education The decade around      was a period of great social upheaval in Wales  manifested in the Chartist movement  In              people marched on Newport  resulting in a riot when    people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel  and the Rebecca Riots where tollbooths on turnpikes were systematically destroyed  This unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the English establishment since social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills  The Times newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems  In July       three commissioners  R R W  Lingen  Jellynger C  Symons and H R  Vaughan Johnson  were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales  the Commissioners were all Anglicans and thus presumed unsympathetic to the nonconformist majority in Wales  The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on   July      in three large blue bound volumes  This report quickly became known as the Treachery of the Blue Books  Brad y Llyfrau Gleision      since  apart from documenting the state of education in Wales  the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language  nonconformity  and the morals of the Welsh people in general  An immediate effect of the report was that ordinary Welsh people began to believe that the only way to get on in the world was through the medium of English  and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated  The historian Professor Kenneth O  Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as  the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history         Welsh language as the medium of instruction In the later   th century  virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English  even in areas where the pupils barely understood English  Some schools used the Welsh Not  a piece of wood  often bearing the letters  WN   which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh  The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh  with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being given a beating  One of the most famous Welsh born pioneers of higher education in Wales was Sir Hugh Owen  He made great progress in the cause of education  and more especially the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth  of which he was chief founder  He has been credited by whom   with the Welsh Intermediate Education Act               Vict c      following which several new Welsh schools were built  The first was completed in      and named Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen  Towards the beginning of the   th century this policy slowly began to change  partly owing to the efforts of O M  Edwards when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in       The Aberystwyth Welsh School  Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth  was founded in      by Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards  the son of O M  Edwards  as the first Welsh Primary School      The headteacher was Norah Isaac  Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth is still a very successful school  and now there are Welsh language primary schools all over the country  Ysgol Glan Clwyd was established in Rhyl in      as the first Welsh medium secondary school        Sign promoting the learning of Welsh Welsh is now widely used in education  with         children and young people in Wales receiving their education in Welsh medium schools in                 in primary and        in secondary         per cent of all schools in Wales are defined as Welsh medium schools  with a further     per cent offering some Welsh medium instruction to pupils         per cent of pupils are in schools in which Welsh is the primary language of instruction  Under the National Curriculum  it is compulsory that all students study Welsh up to the age of    as either a first or a second language      Some students choose to continue with their studies through the medium of Welsh for the completion of their A levels as well as during their college years  All local education authorities in Wales have schools providing bilingual or Welsh medium education      The remainder study Welsh as a second language in English medium schools  Specialist teachers of Welsh called Athrawon Bro support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum  Welsh is also taught in adult education classes  The Welsh Government has recently set up six centres of excellence in the teaching of Welsh for Adults  with centres in North Wales      Mid Wales  South West  Glamorgan  Gwent  and Cardiff  The ability to speak Welsh or to have Welsh as a qualification is desirable for certain career choices in Wales  such as teaching or customer service      All universities in Wales teach courses in the language  with many undergraduate and post graduate degree programmes offered in the medium of Welsh  ranging from law  modern languages  social sciences  and also other sciences such as biological sciences  Aberystwyth  Cardiff  Bangor  and Swansea have all had chairs in Welsh since their virtual establishment  and all their schools of Welsh are successful centres for the study of the Welsh language and its literature  offering a BA in Welsh as well as post graduate courses  At all Welsh universities and the Open University  students have the right to submit assessed work and sit exams in Welsh even if the course was taught in English  usually the only exception is where the course requires demonstrating proficiency in another language   Following a commitment made in the One Wales coalition government between Labour and Plaid Cymru  the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol  Welsh Language National College  was established  The purpose of the federal structured college  spread out between all the universities of Wales  is to provide and also advance Welsh medium courses and Welsh medium scholarship and research in Welsh universities  There is also a Welsh medium academic journal called Gwerddon   Oasis    which is a platform for academic research in Welsh and is published quarterly  There have been calls for more teaching of Welsh in English medium schools   Use in Professional Engineering edit  When conducting applicants  professional reviews for Chartered Engineer status  the Institution of Engineering and Technology accepts applications in the Welsh Language and will conduct face to face interviews in the Welsh Language if requested to do so  It should be noted  however  that one of the requirements for Chartered Engineer is also to be able to communicate effectively in the English Language   In information technology edit  Further information  List of Celtic language media Like many of the world s languages  the Welsh language has seen an increased use and presence on the internet  ranging from formal lists of terminology in a variety of fields     to Welsh language interfaces for Windows    Microsoft Windows XP  Vista  Microsoft Office  LibreOffice  OpenOffice org  Mozilla Firefox and a variety of Linux distributions  and on line services to blogs kept in Welsh      Wikipedia has had a Welsh version since July      and Facebook since        Mobile phone technology edit  In      the Welsh Language Board launched a free software pack which enabled the use of SMS predictive text in Welsh      At the National Eisteddfod of Wales       a further announcement was made by the Welsh Language Board that the mobile phone company Samsung was to work with the network provider Orange to provide the first mobile phone in the Welsh language      with the interface and the T  dictionary on the Samsung S     available in the Welsh language  The model  available with the Welsh language interface  has been available since   September       with plans to introduce it on other networks      On Android devices  both the built in Google Keyboard and user created keyboards can be used      iOS devices have fully supported the Welsh language since the release of iOS   in September       Users can switch their device to Welsh to access apps that are available in Welsh  Date and time on iOS is also localised  as shown by the built in Calendar application  as well as certain third party apps that have been localised           In warfare edit  Secure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime  In a similar way as Navajo code talkers were used by the United States military during World War II  the Royal Welch Fusiliers  a Welsh regiment serving in Bosnia  used Welsh for emergency communications that needed to be secure       Use within the British parliament edit  In       parliamentary rules were amended to allow the use of Welsh when the Welsh Grand Committee meets at Westminster  The change did not alter the rules about debates within the House of Commons  where only English can be used      In February       Welsh was first used when the Welsh Secretary  Alun Cairns  delivered his welcoming speech at a sitting of the committee  He said   I am proud to be using the language I grew up speaking  which is not only important to me  my family and the communities Welsh MPs represent  but is also an integral part of Welsh history and culture                Use at the European Union edit  In November       the Welsh language was used at a meeting of the European Union s Council of Ministers for the first time  The Heritage Minister Alun Ffred Jones addressed his audience in Welsh and his words were interpreted into the EU s    official languages  The official use of the language followed years of campaigning  Jones said  In the UK we have one of the world s major languages  English  as the mother tongue of many  But there is a diversity of languages within our islands  I am proud to be speaking to you in one of the oldest of these  Welsh  the language of Wales   He described the breakthrough as  more than  merely  symbolic  saying  Welsh might be one of the oldest languages to be used in the UK  but it remains one of the most vibrant  Our literature  our arts  our festivals  our great tradition of song all find expression through our language  And this is a powerful demonstration of how our culture  the very essence of who we are  is expressed through language        Use by the Voyager programme edit  A greeting in Welsh is one of the    languages included on the Voyager Golden Record chosen to be representative of Earth in NASA s Voyager programme launched in           The greetings are unique to each language  with the Welsh greeting being Iechyd da i chwi yn awr ac yn oesoedd  which translates into English as  Good health to you now and forever            Vocabulary edit  Welsh supplements its core Brittonic vocabulary  words such as wy  egg   carreg  stone    with hundreds of word lemmas borrowed from Latin      such as  ffenestr  window    Latin fenestra  gwin  wine    Latin vinum   It also borrows words from English  such as  silff  shelf   gi t  gate     Phonology edit  Main article  Welsh phonology    This article contains IPA phonetic symbols  Without proper rendering support  you may see question marks  boxes  or other symbols instead of Unicode characters  For an introductory guide on IPA symbols  see Help IPA   The phonology of Welsh includes a number of sounds that do not occur in English and are typologically rare in European languages  The voiceless alveolar lateral fricative      the voiceless nasals  m     n   and       and the voiceless alveolar trill  r   are distinctive features of the Welsh language  Stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words  and the word final unstressed syllable receives a higher pitch than the stressed syllable   Orthography edit  Main article  Welsh orthography Welsh is written in a Latin alphabet of    letters  of which eight are digraphs treated as separate letters for collation   a  b  c  ch  d  dd  e  f  ff  g  ng  h  i  j  l  ll  m  n  o  p  ph  r  rh  s  t  th  u  w  y In contrast to English practice   w  and  y  are considered vowel letters in Welsh along with  a    e    i    o  and  u   The letter  j  was not used traditionally  but is now used in many everyday words borrowed from English  like jam  j c  joke  and garej  garage   The letters  k    q    v    x   and  z  are used in some technical terms  like kilogram  volt and zero  but in all cases can be  and often are  replaced by Welsh letters  cilogram  folt and sero      The letter  k  was in common use until the   th century  but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh  as William Salesbury explained   C for K  because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth   This change was not popular at the time      The most common diacritic is the circumflex  which usually disambiguates long vowels  most often in the case of homographs  where the vowel is short in one word and long in the other  e g  man   place   vs m n   fine  small     Morphology edit  Main articles  Colloquial Welsh morphology and Literary Welsh morphology  Welsh morphology has much in common with that of the other modern Insular Celtic languages  such as the use of initial consonant mutations and of so called  conjugated prepositions   prepositions that fuse with the personal pronouns that are their object   Welsh nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders  masculine and feminine  but they are not inflected for case  Welsh has a variety of different endings and other methods to indicate the plural  and two endings to indicate the singular  technically the singulative  of some nouns  In spoken Welsh  verbal features are indicated primarily by the use of auxiliary verbs rather than by the inflection of the main verb  In literary Welsh  on the other hand  inflection of the main verb is usual   Syntax edit  Main article  Welsh syntax The canonical word order in Welsh is verb subject object  VSO   Colloquial Welsh inclines very strongly towards the use of auxiliaries with its verbs  as in English  The present tense is constructed with bod   to be   as an auxiliary verb  with the main verb appearing as a verbnoun  used in a way loosely equivalent to an infinitive  after the particle yn   Mae Si n yn mynd i Lanelli Si n is going to Llanelli  There  mae is a third person singular present indicative form of bod  and mynd is the verbnoun meaning  to go   The imperfect is constructed in a similar manner  as are the periphrastic forms of the future and conditional tenses  In the preterite  future and conditional mood tenses  there are inflected forms of all verbs  which are used in the written language  However  speech now more commonly uses the verbnoun together with an inflected form of gwneud   do    so  I went  can be Mi es i or Mi wnes i fynd   I did go    Mi is an example of a preverbal particle  such particles are common in Welsh  though less so in the spoken language  Welsh lacks separate pronouns for constructing subordinate clauses  instead  special verb forms or relative pronouns that appear identical to some preverbal particles are used   Possessives as direct objects of verbnouns edit  The Welsh for  I like Rhodri  is Dw i n hoffi Rhodri  word for word   am I  the  liking  of  Rhodri    with Rhodri in a possessive relationship with hoffi  With personal pronouns  the possessive form of the personal pronoun is used  as in  I like him    Dw i n ei hoffi   literally   am I his liking     I like you  is  Dw i n dy hoffi    am I your liking    Very informally  the pronouns are often heard in their normal subject object form and aping English word order  Dw i n hoffi ti   Am I liking you     Pronoun doubling edit  In colloquial Welsh  possessive pronouns  whether they are used to mean  my    your   etc  or to indicate the direct object of a verbnoun  are commonly reinforced by the use of the corresponding personal pronoun after the noun or verbnoun  ei d  e  his house   literally  his house of him    Dw i n dy hoffi di  I like you    I am  engaged in the action of  your liking of you    etc  The  reinforcement   or  simply   redoubling   adds no emphasis in the colloquial register  While the possessive pronoun alone may be used  especially in more formal registers  as shown above  it is considered incorrect to use only the personal pronoun  Such usage is nevertheless sometimes heard in very colloquial speech  mainly among young speakers  Ble  dyn ni n mynd  T  ti neu d  fi    Where are we going  Your house or my house      Counting system edit  Main article  Welsh numerals The traditional counting system used in the Welsh language is vigesimal  i e  it is based on twenties  as in standard French numbers     soixante dix  literally  sixty ten   to     quatre vingt dix neuf  literally  four twenty nineteen    Welsh numbers from    to    are  x on ten   e g  un ar ddeg          to    are  x on fifteen   e g  un ar bymtheg       though    is deunaw   two nines   numbers from    to    are       on twenty  e g  deg ar hugain          is deugain  two twenties      is trigain  three twenties   etc  This form continues to be used  especially by older people  and it is obligatory in certain circumstances  such as telling the time  and in ordinal numbers        There is also a decimal counting system  which has become relatively widely used  though less so in giving the time  ages  and dates  it features no ordinal numbers   This system originated in Patagonian Welsh and was subsequently introduced to Wales in the     s       Whereas    in the vigesimal system is pedwar ar bymtheg ar hugain   four on fifteen on twenty   or even deugain namyn un   two twenty minus one    in the decimal system it is tri deg naw   three tens nine    Although there is only one word for  one   un   it triggers the soft mutation  treiglad meddal  of feminine nouns  where possible  other than those beginning with  ll  or  rh   There are separate masculine and feminine forms of the numbers  two   dau and dwy    three   tri and tair  and  four   pedwar and pedair   which must agree with the grammatical gender of the objects being counted  The objects being counted appear in the singular  not plural form   Dialects edit  Currently  there is no standardised or definitive form of the Welsh language  with significant differences in dialect marked in pronunciation  vocabulary and in points of grammar  For example  consider the question  Do you want a cuppa  a cup of tea    In Gwynedd this would typically be Dach chi isio panad  while in the south of Dyfed one would be more likely to hear Ych chi n moyn dishgled   though in other parts of the South one would not be surprised to hear Ych chi isie paned  as well  among other possibilities   An example of a pronunciation difference is the tendency in some southern dialects to palatalise the letter  s   e g  mis  Welsh for  month    usually pronounced IPA   mi s   but as IPA   mi    in parts of the south  This normally occurs next to a high front vowel like  i   although exceptions include the pronunciation of sut  how  as IPA     d  in the southern dialects  compared with northern IPA   s t     The four traditional dialects edit  Although modern understanding often splits Welsh into northern  Gogledd  and southern  De   dialects   the traditional classification of four Welsh dialects remains the most academically useful   Y Wyndodeg  the Gwynedd dialect Y Bowyseg  the Powys dialect Y Ddyfedeg  the Dyfed dialect Y Wenhwyseg  the dialect of Gwent and Morgannwg      A fifth dialect is Patagonian Welsh  which has developed since the start of Y Wladfa  the Welsh settlement in Argentina  in       it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features  but a survey in the     s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut valley and in the Andes  Subdialects exist within the main dialects  such as the Cofi dialect   The book Cymraeg  Cymr g  Cymr g  Cyflwyno r Tafodieithoedd  Welsh for  Welsh  Welsh  Welsh  Introducing the Dialects        was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of fourteen different speakers demonstrating aspects of different regional dialects  The book also refers to the earlier Linguistic Geography of Wales      as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions  In the     s  there was an attempt to standardise the Welsh language by teaching Cymraeg Byw   Living Welsh     a colloquially based generic form of Welsh       But the attempt largely failed because it did not encompass the regional differences used by Welsh speakers   Registers edit  Modern Welsh can be considered to fall broadly into two main registers Colloquial Welsh  Cymraeg llafar  and Literary Welsh  Cymraeg llenyddol   The grammar described is that of Colloquial Welsh  which is used in most speech and informal writing  Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh standardised by the      translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal registers  including much literature  As a standardised form  literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh  Some differences include     Literary Welsh  Colloquial Welsh   Can omit subject pronouns  pro drop   Subject pronouns rarely omitted   More extensive use of simple verb forms  More extensive use of periphrastic verb forms   No distinction between simple present and future  e g  af  I go   I shall go    Simple form most often expresses only future  e g  af i  I ll go     Subjunctive verb forms  Subjunctive in fixed idioms only    rd pl ending and pronoun  nt hwy   rd pl ending and pronoun  n nhw  Amongst the characteristics of the literary  as against the spoken  language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms  different usage of some of the tenses  less frequent use of pronouns  since the information is usually conveyed in the verb preposition inflections  and a much lesser tendency to substitute English loanwords for native Welsh words  In addition  more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh   Examples of sentences in literary and colloquial Welsh edit    English  Literary Welsh  Colloquial Welsh   I get up early every day   Codaf yn gynnar bob dydd   Dw i n codi n gynnar bob dydd   North Rwy n codi n gynnar bob dydd   South    I ll get up early tomorrow   Codaf yn gynnar yfory   Mi goda i n gynnar fory   North Wna i godi n gynnar fory   South    He had not stood there long   Ni safasai yno yn hir        Doedd o

The differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary language  The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible  amongst other things   although the      Beibl Cymraeg Newydd  Welsh for  New Welsh Bible   is significantly less formal than the traditional      Bible  Gareth King  author of a popular Welsh grammar  observes that  The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English        A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in A Grammar of Welsh by Stephen J  Williams      or more completely in Gramadeg y Gymraeg by Peter Wynn Thomas        No comprehensive grammar of formal literary Welsh exists in English   An English language guide to colloquial Welsh forms and register and dialect differences is Dweud Eich
