       Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Main article  Digital terrestrial television  Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom encompasses over     television  radio and interactive services broadcast via the United Kingdom s terrestrial television network and receivable with a standard television set  The majority of digital terrestrial television  DTT  services  including the five former analogue channels  are broadcast free to air  and a further selection of encrypted pay TV services  such as Racing TV  are also available  Freeview is the only DTT service since Top Up TV closed in       BT TV services are carried via IPTV signals  The digital broadcasting technology adopted in the UK is the DVB T system  Digital Video Broadcasting   Terrestrial  carrying compressed digital audio  video and other data in a combined transport stream  using COFDM modulation  A total of eight national and one local  multiplexes  are broadcast in the UK  guaranteed to reach over     of the country  Three of the multiplexes  carrying the free public service channels operated by the BBC  ITV  Channel    S C and Channel    are guaranteed wider coverage still  reaching       of the country including areas dependent on low power local relays     In the UK  the switchover from analogue to digital TV started on    October      and was completed on    October       Each group of regional transmitters had its analogue broadcasts switched off at a certain point between those

sites     Receiving and recording edit  Digital Terrestrial Television is commonly received by means of a compatible set top box or integrated digital television  IDTV   connected to an appropriate receiving antenna  In most cases  reception is possible using aerials originally used for analogue television  Transmissions may be recorded in many ways   such as via the connection of a set top box to an existing  analogue  video or DVD recorder  or by the use of newer models of such recorders which have built in digital tuners  However the most common option is by the use of set top boxes which incorporate a hard disk drive  and allow the recording of the digital signal directly to disk  for later replay  Recording on such boxes  known as Personal Video Recorders or PVRs  is more convenient  as programmes may be easily selected for recording from an on screen programme guide  with no need to specify explicit start and end times for recordings  and no need to program more than one piece of equipment  Many television services which incorporate DTT channels in their service offering   e g  Top Up TV  BT TV  and TalkTalk Plus TV  offer set top boxes with such a recording facility  Non subscription DTT PVRs are also available and are often sold under the  Freeview   banner  formerly Freeview Playback   There also exist a variety of solutions to enable the viewing and recording of DTT programmes on personal computers  with various TV cards or USB tuners available for use with a variety of software packages  including MythTV and Windows Media Center  Most cards or tuners include their own software in the package also   Features edit  Digital Terrestrial Television provides many more channels  For some viewers it offers much improved reception compared to analogue broadcasts  although these had been entirely discontinued in the UK by        including      anamorphic widescreen  A number of interactive services are also offered  An eight day Electronic Programme Guide  EPG  is available and allows viewers to see programme descriptions and broadcast times well in advance  PVRs will make use of this facility allowing recording timers to be set  This Eight Day EPG was not an original feature of the Digital Terrestrial system  therefore some early receivers  such as receivers originally made to operate with the ONdigital service  will only display details of  now and next  programme information  A fourteen day Top Up TV EPG was an alternative which was available to TUTV branded PVRs   History edit  Development and launch edit  Digital terrestrial television launched in the UK on    November       just after digital satellite television on   October       The technology required that the UK government license the broadcast of channels in six groups  or multiplexes  abbreviated to  mux   labelled       A  B  C  and D     The Independent Television Commission  ITC  allocated each existing analogue terrestrial channel half the capacity of a multiplex each  This meant the BBC got a multiplex to themselves  Multiplex     ITV and Channel   shared Multiplex    though       of the capacity was given to Teletext Ltd   and Channel   and S C shared Multiplex A  The remaining spectrum  Multiplexes B  C and D  was then auctioned off  A consortium made up of Granada and Carlton  members of the ITV network  which have now merged to form ITV plc  and BSkyB successfully bid for these licences  and set up the subscription ONdigital service  though BSkyB left the consortium prior to launch  The BBC made some use of its multiplex for three of its then four new television services  BBC Choice  which had started on    September      with four national variations   BBC News    and BBC Parliament  albeit in sound only   ITV initially used their space to house ITV   from   December       in England and Wales  You   later UTV   in Northern Ireland and S  in Scotland  now both ITV    as well as GMTV  during the early mornings  Channel   used their space for subscription channels FilmFour and E  which  although not part of ONdigital  would be paid for and were only available through an ONdigital subscription  Channel   s nationwide coverage on  mux    enabled it to be received terrestrially throughout much of Wales for the first time in its history  where previously only S C had been available  Consequently  S C s digital service   S C Digidol  carries only Welsh language programming  in contrast to S C analogue which also carries English language programmes commissioned and transmitted by Channel   in other parts of the UK  Channel   sold its half of Multiplex A to the owners of the other half of the multiplex  S C  who set up a subsidiary called S C Digital Networks  SDN  to manage the multiplex and rented most of it out to ONdigital as well as some space to the BBC who launched BBC Knowledge on   June       at a time when technical capabilities limited the number of stations it could carry on its own multiplex  S C chose not to carry S C Digidol and its newly launched digital Welsh Assembly station  S C  outside Wales  preferring to sell the space instead  Consequently  some ONdigital services were not available on Welsh transmitters  While the BBC was seemingly concerned with delivering a service of good technical quality  other broadcasters chose to deliver a larger number of channels rather than optimise service reliability and picture quality      ITV Digital edit  Main article  ITV Digital ONdigital had problems from the start  and renaming the service ITV Digital on    July      failed to help the matter  All subscription services except E  and FilmFour went off air on   May      after the consortium collapsed  explained as being due to paying too much for the television rights for The Football League  However  the choice of   QAM broadcast mode  the fact that at least     of homes would need new aerials to receive it  a high churn rate  an insecure hackable encryption system  the cost of having to provide free set top boxes  and aggressive competition from BSkyB all contributed to ITV Digital s spiraling costs  before shareholders Granada and Carlton called a halt to the venture   Freeview edit  Main article  Freeview  UK  As ITV Digital had collapsed  the rights reverted to the regulator and the ITC invited bids for the space on Multiplexes B  C and D  The Freeview consortium was formed by the BBC  transmitter company National Grid Wireless  known at the time as Crown Castle UK  and BSkyB  This consortium  legal name DTV Services Ltd and trading under the  Freeview  brand  won and launched a new service  Dropping the failed ITV Digital business model  Freeview launched on    October      with free television channels only  and made digital radio stations available on television receivers for the first time  The BBC controlled one Multiplex  B  for its own services  and Crown Castle National Grid the other two  C   D  for commercial services  though the Community Channel also operated on Multiplex B  The BBC s second multiplex has allowed it to televise BBC Parliament where it had previously only been available in sound  allowed BBC Knowledge and its successor  BBC   to stop renting space from SDN for coverage  and allowed for special video screens in its interactive service BBCi  for use during sporting events such as Wimbledon and carrying loops of news headlines and weather   services already provided on digital satellite  On    October       ITV plc and Channel   joined the Freeview consortium and in the same year ITV plc also bought SDN and as such they gained control of Multiplex A   Top Up TV edit  Main article  Top Up TV The space ITV Digital had rented on other multiplexes initially became empty again  but some were rented out to allow new channels to launch  In May      Top Up TV was launched to provide subscription content in hitherto unused space on multiplex A  rented from Channel      and additional services transmitted by Channel   on their own capacity on Multiplex    TCM purchased its own slot throughout England  Scotland and Northern Ireland from the multiplex owner  SDN  but rents from Sit up Ltd in Wales  timesharing with bid tv  Multiplex A is ultimately owned by ITV Plc via its SDN acquisition  but ITV only has involvement with Top Up TV channels via Channel       In September of the same year  Top Up TV began operating solely on Multiplex A  as Channel   reclaimed the bandwidth on Multiplex   for its own services More    E   and most recently Film   In October       Channel   launched two new free to air digital channels  Five Life and Five US  using capacity formerly leased out to Top Up TV     This left Top Up TV with a reduced number of video streams  In November       the company launched Top Up TV Anytime  a service which broadcasts overnight  downloads  which are recorded by a proprietary Top Up TV Anytime personal video recorder  PVR   At the same time  they started reducing the linear service  On    April       Ofcom ruled that  on request of each multiplex operator  the  free to air channels only  requirement put in place at the launch of Freeview in      may be lifted on Multiplex B  C and D  The effect of this ruling is that if a Mux operator requests the restriction to be lifted  their multiplex may carry pay TV services  Ofcom says that the digital television market has changed significantly since       Consequently  it believes that this restriction is no longer required  During the consultation    of the    responses from broadcasters were in favour of removing the restriction  These included the BBC  The BBC agreed that the digital television market had changed substantially since       and that Top Up TV probably couldn t afford the current cost of DTT slots anyway  The BBC suggested that the deregulation should be conditional on a number of further changes to regulation  These included that Ofcom changes the transmission mode of broadcast on all multiplexes from   QAM to   QAM so more services could be squeezed onto the digital terrestrial platform  However  Ofcom rejected these suggestions  saying they were outside the scope of the consultation  Out of the three that opposed  one was Channel    which has been putting in place a portfolio of free to air channels  among them Film  which was made free to air across all platforms on    July       Channel   argued that the number of free channels available has been the major driving force behind the massive success of the platform   there are now more than    million Freeview boxes in use  A number of broadcasters requested that their replies were kept confidential  These include ITV and BSkyB  However  it is believed that ITV opposed the plan and BSkyB supported it     In addition to replies from broadcasters  there were    replies from individuals  Of these     opposed the change  The channels on Multiplexes B  C and D are those owned by the Freeview consortium and include the three Sky channels on the platform and the UKTV channels  However  Ofcom believes that in the short to medium term  it is unlikely existing free to air channels will convert to pay TV  This is because  firstly  Multiplex B is run by the BBC  which is not expected to request the removal of the free to air requirement  Secondly  due to the nature of the contracts the channel broadcasters hold with multiplex operators and content providers  it is unlikely a channel will be able to change to pay TV  It was announced on   February      that BSkyB intended to withdraw Sky Three  Sky News and Sky Sports News from the platform in the summer of       BSkyB had said that it intended to replace them with   of its subscription channels  It also said that it would use an alternative  MPEG   codec  which would enable a greater number of channels to be broadcast  but would require the purchase of new equipment for those who wished to receive the new service     On   October      Ofcom said that the plans for a new subscription service raised competition concerns and may have to be scrapped           update causing failures edit  During       a rolling programme of transmitter updates caused approximately         set top boxes to stop working altogether  Freeview had warned consumers in advance of the update  which was phased over a three month period      The problem affected a specific range of older units  and was caused by an increased Network Information Table  channel list  exceeding the memory available in some set top boxes  This had been part of the specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes  but not in those using the SetPal chip set      Affected consumers were advised to buy new set top boxes  Affected models are   Digital recorders  TiVo Series  Daewoo DS   P Digital boxes  Daewoo SV    Labgear DTT    Portland DP    Triax DVB    T Some other models and televisions also require an over air download for correct operation   Digital switchover edit     Switchover complete For full list of dates  see digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom  Summary edit  The UK Government s intention was that digital terrestrial television would completely replace analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom by    October       This process was known as  Digital Switchover   or DSO  The industry association for digital television in the UK  Digital TV Group  was responsible for co ordination between Freeview and other digital services  DTG licensed suitable equipment to bear the Digital Tick and Freeview Playback Logos     to identify PVRs and other devices designed to work through switchover  and to raise awareness of DTT product quality and standards  Digital terrestrial television is broadcast using the DVB T international standard for standard definition content and DVB T  for high definition content  The digital switchover process involved discontinuing analogue terrestrial TV broadcasts  which in some areas allowed for greater signal strength and or better coverage of digital multiplexes  The process concluded on    October       when digital switchover completed in Northern Ireland  the same day as the Republic of Ireland also completed its digital switchover       In areas where analogue signals had terminated  older receiving equipment was likely to require replacement or upgrade  This process was subsidised by the UK Government for those on low incomes  Contracts for this operation were awarded to BSkyB in the Border Television region  Upgrading of analogue receiving equipment required a Freeview set top box  or other DVB T capable digital receiver   Where an analogue TV recording device was in use this ideally would require a separate Freeview set top box  to replicate the previous functionality of recording and watching different programme sources   History edit  The progress towards digital switchover in the UK was long  The then Secretary of State for Culture  Media and Sport  Chris Smith  announced in      that the Government s intention was to achieve switchover  between      and        Work started in earnest with the setting up of the Digital Action Plan  a body working across industry  government and consumer groups to advise on the best way to meet the switchover target date  By       however  it was becoming clear that switchover could not start by       In particular  the decision taken by the International Telecommunication Union to call a Regional Radiocommunication Conference to establish a frequency plan for digital broadcasting meant that in practice  substantive steps towards switchover would need to wait until after the conference s second session  due to be held in May and June       On    September       addressing the Royal Television Society in Cambridge  Smith s successor at the DCMS  Tessa Jowell  announced the go ahead for switchover in the UK  coupled with support measures to ensure the disadvantaged are not left behind      On the day after Jowell s speech  an independent not for profit company  Digital UK  was established to co ordinate the switchover process  Set up by the broadcasters and the commercial multiplex operators  Digital UK was required to co ordinate the project and ensure that the public are kept informed about progress  Local television broadcasters  including the BBC and ITV  actively encouraged viewers to upgrade to digital television  UK broadcasters were also under additional pressure to complete migration before the Olympic Games   Digital rollout edit  The British Government gave Ofcom and Digital UK jointly the task of discontinuing analogue television broadcasting  The switch off occurred on an ITV sub region basis      In March       a technical trial in Ferryside  Wales  resulted in viewers losing three out of the four available analogue channels in favour of going digital  leaving only analogue BBC Two Wales until switchover at Preseli in August       at the time  BBC  W on digital offered a different schedule to BBC Two Wales on analogue   In October       following a    month publicity and information campaign  and an early digital launch in August by Channel        the Whitehaven  Eskdale Green and Gosforth transmitters switched off analogue signals on the BBC Two frequency  and began broadcasting a temporary digital service for the main channels  On    November  all analogue signals were switched off  and the permanent three multiplex digital service began  albeit with Channel   only on the Whitehaven transmitter  until        Unfortunately  as had been feared  a small number of homes among the hills  which had received  fuzzy  analogue signals  particularly in Eskdale  were unable to receive a decodable Freeview signal      The only other serious problem resulted from the  rescan  command in some models of set top box defaulting to frequencies used by the nearest main transmitter  instead of the strongest digital signals  this could be overcome by using the  add channel  option to select channels one by one  and in the long term by corrections to the boxes  software      In November       the full rolling programme started in the ITV Border region at the Selkirk transmitter  with the Caldbeck transmitter switching a year later  Caldbeck was rebuilt  and broadcasts Scottish multiplexes as well as English ones to improve service to viewers north of the border  the nearby Sandale transmitter ceased to broadcast TV   The programme continued across the rest of the country  with the Westcountry region  Wales and the Granada region switching over in       The West  STV North  STV Central regions and the Channel Islands followed in       the Central  Yorkshire and Anglia regions in       and finally the Meridian  London  Tyne Tees   UTV regions in       Many decisions had to be made  including what to do about people who may find the new technology confusing  or who have no desire to receive more than the four or five channels they originally had  and who may have been reluctant to buy a digital box to view the free channels  The government arranged for the BBC to administer a Digital Switchover Help Scheme to ensure that groups such as the over   s and recipients of disability benefits did not lose their television services when analogue transmissions were switched off  Another issue was that the       per cent of the population  availability target could only be achieved  via rooftop aerials       while Section     of the Communications Act      sets out the principle  that no person should unreasonably be denied access to an electronic communications network or to electronic communications services       This is taken to mean that everyone has the right to mount a television aerial on their roof      Ofcom allocated frequencies for groups of households to provide  self help  relay transmitters at their own expense  for analogue broadcasts there were some     of these  serving around        households   but suggested that in such cases  terrestrial TV may no longer be the most cost effective solution       The switchover process edit   Digital Switchover banner in Porthmadog  Wales  as seen in September      After several months of press publicity  leaflet drops  public meetings etc   captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters  warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off and that they would need to take action  for Whitehaven  the first large area to switch over  the captions started appearing some   months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off       At about the same time  details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed  Although viewers who lived outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage  test screens on Ceefax  BBC One   Two  and Teletext  ITV   C  S C  page     made it possible to determine whether they were likely to need a new aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions  Next  detailed information booklets were delivered to all households in the area  including many on the fringe who may have been receiving their TV from other transmitters  hence the importance of the on screen warning captions   Two or three months later  the first stage of the switchover began with the analogue BBC Two replaced with the new BBC A multiplex      At some locations  during the period between stage one and stage two  BBC One  ITV or Channel   moved to the analogue BBC Two frequency where that channel s frequency was required for the digital transmission of Multiplex    At the same time  captions appeared on the remaining analogue channels reminding viewers of the impending switchover  Finally  the second stage saw the remaining analogue transmissions switched off and the other high power multiplexes switched on  Initially  this occurred four weeks after stage one  but starting with the switchover at Mendip in April      onwards  this gap was reduced to two weeks  Three multiplexes  BBC A  D     BBC B  are for public service broadcasting and are broadcast from all transmitter sites  They contain around    TV channels  half a dozen radio stations and half a dozen text interactive services  These include all the television channels from the BBC  some from ITV and Channel    Channel   and S C  in Wales only   The other three multiplexes  SDN  Arqiva A  Arqiva B  are broadcast from main transmitter sites only and are operated by their respective commercial licence holders  To reflect the slightly changed roles  the multiplex names were also changed         Old multiplex name  New multiplex name  Owning company      BBC A  BBC      D     Digital       A  SDN  S C Digital Networks  ITV plc    B  BBC B  BBC   C  Arqiva A  Arqiva   D  Arqiva B  Arqiva   Post switchover edit  The adoption of the technically superior DVB T  k format occurred in each region at the date of switchover  This resulted in no reception for viewers with older   k  only equipment  such as former ONdigital ITV Digital boxes  and other incompatible IDTVs and set top boxes      In the Meridian and Anglia regions  transmitters formed a single frequency network when they were converted to all digital operation      Alternative post switchover multiplex designations were used on internal documentation by the BBC switchover contractor Arqiva      but changing the designations of the multiplexes requires changes to legislation    and to the multiplex licences issued by Ofcom and is not in the current draft      When digital switchover was complete  two new sub bands of the UHF spectrum were clear  frequencies corresponding to channel ranges       and         leaving only channels       and       for digital television multiplexes  This  digital dividend      required millions of homes to upgrade their aerials to the wideband type to receive some or all of the Freeview multiplexes      This spectrum is useful because of its trade off between bandwidth and range  Following a consultation  in September      Ofcom stated that an auction for the     MHz band will most likely lead to channels       being used for three new TV multiplexes  a reference transmission plan assumes two frequencies would be multiple frequency networks  and channel    would be used as a national single frequency network      The remaining reallocated frequencies can be re used for other services  for example the provision of   Mobile Television services wireless  mobile  broadband services wider coverage for advanced services in remote and rural areas more multiplexes carrying more channels high definition  HD  services The clearing and re allocation of these channels of the spectrum for other services caused some controversy within technical industries  such as wireless microphones  as Ofcom decided to clear channel             MHz  to match the rest of Europe and make the facilitation of future services easier      Further re allocations of the other freed analogue television channels have not yet occurred  but when implemented will require legislation changes  It is likely that if they are sold commercially  they will not only attract interest  but may be bought for millions of pounds due to the high demand for spectrum throughout most of Europe  Ofcom have published further information about the auctioned channel in an announcement on their website  OFCOM released their consultation of the future of the     MHz and     MHz UHF bands beyond      on    November           This document recommends that the     MHz UHF band is allocated to DVB T  MPEG   Freeview HD services and Whitespace services  allowing a future migration of the existing     MHz Freeview allocation to     MHz mobile data services  synchronising the bandwidth usage with many other markets in Europe and globally    Digit Al edit  Digit Al is a robot character created for Digital UK in       by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO and voiced by the English comedy actor Matt Lucas  used in material publicising the digital switchover  It appeared in the public information programme run by Digital UK until       The character was first transmitted simultaneously on about     television channels and on regional BBC television on   May            Digital Self Help Relays edit  Terrestrial analogue relay stations have been repeating TV signals to areas not covered by broadcaster owned transmitters since the Independent Broadcasting Authority started licensing them in       Recently self help groups have had to look into upgrading their old analogue transmitters to digital ones  The first digital self help relay was installed at Ladram Bay  Devon by Stuart Harse and Liam Kelly  broadcast engineers from Bristol   The system was designed by Mike Rea of Taylor Transmitters  Oldham UK  The Ladram Bay TV repeater broadcasts all six mux signals from the Stockland Hill transmitter   Post switchover reorganisation and HD edit  This section needs to be updated  Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information   August       In March       the development of a new second generation digital terrestrial broadcasting standard  DVB T   was agreed by the DVB Group  The BBC  ITV  Channel    S C and Channel   agreed with the regulator Ofcom to convert one UK multiplex  B  or PSB   to DVB T  to increase capacity for HDTV  High Definition Television  via DTT      The first TV region to use the new standard was Granada in November       with existing switched over regions being changed at the same time   It is expected that over time there will be enough DVB T  receivers sold to switch all DTT transmissions to DVB T   and MPEG   Part     citation needed  From    October       Multiplex B  PSB   was cleared of SD channels in post DSO areas  which were moved to Multiplex    PSB    In pre DSO areas  Multiplex B continued to carry BBC Four  BBC Parliament  CBeebies  BBC Radio Stations and     until DSO  Former streams of     and News Multiscreen on Multiplex B were sublet to broadcasters other than the BBC for pre DSO areas only  and were not available at all in post DSO areas because of the new DVB T  HD multiplex as replacement  On   April       Ofcom published its final decision for the HDTV transmission format  DVB T  and MPEG        Initially there were to be three HD services available  BBC HD  ITV HD STV HD and Channel   HD S C Clirlun      Channel   HD was due to launch during      but was unable to reach  key criteria  to keep its slot          Spare allocation on multiplex B was handed over to the BBC  two years to the date when it was anticipated that further capacity on multiplex B would revert to the control of the BBC Trust  On   November       BBC One HD launched on Freeview HD      It is available in addition to the existing BBC HD channel  During       Ofcom gave the Commercial Public Service Broadcasters another opportunity to apply to provide an additional HD service from

December        Learn how and when to remove this template message  Each multiplex is an error protected bitstream of        or    megabits per second  which can be used for almost any combination of digitally encoded video  audio and data  The DVB T standard provides a multiplex service that can make trade offs between the number of services and the picture and audio quality   a number of services use the same bandwidth at different times  For example  CBeebies and BBC Four currently use the same space in their multiplex  with CBeebies broadcasting from   am until   pm and BBC Four from   pm  some multiplexes allocate more bandwidth to services  providing a smaller number of higher quality services  The modulation of the multiplexes can be varied to squeeze higher digital bitrates out of the same portion of the electromagnetic spectrum  but require a stronger signal for good reception  The modulation schemes used in the UK are  in order of bandwidth efficiency  each with a progressively higher bitrate  at the cost of progressively higher likelihood of signal degradation  QPSK  only used for tests in the Oxford and London areas     QAM  no longer used as of digital switchover     QAM  only used on the DVB T multiplex      QAM  only used on the DVB T  multiplex       QAM      QAM  currently in development  By late       multiplexes   and A used    QAM and were consequently more prone to poor reception  while the other multiplexes used    QAM  At switchover the transmission mode was changed from    QAM to    QAM on Multiplex    PSB        increasing the effective bandwidth of the multiplex  The switch to    QAM mode also provided extra bandwidth on Multiplexes C  COM   and D  COM    By late       the digital switchover was complete  with all DVB T multiplexes using    QAM  The switchover allowed the transmitters to broadcast at a higher power level  reducing the likelihood of reception errors when receiving    QAM encoded broadcasts  Multiplexes can make use of statistical multiplexing at the MPEG video coder whereby the bitrate allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on how difficult it is to code the picture content at that precise time  and how much demand there is for bandwidth from other channels  In this way  complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode  with less fine detail  Improvements in compression technology edit  This section does not cite any sources  Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be

acceptance of lower quality or lower resolution broadcasts  allowed gradual increases in the number of services carried on digital terrestrial television multiplexes  As the number of homes receiving digital terrestrial grew  the interest in new channel capacity increased  In       the auction for two new slots on National Grid Wireless multiplex D resulted in broadcasters bidding high prices to gain bandwidth  ITV won the bidding for the first slot  on which it launched Men   Motors on   May       replaced by ITV Play and later ITV      and Channel   the second  Channel   launched E      not its new channel More   on the multiplex when the slot became available on   June  E  launched on Freeview on    May        National Grid Wireless made an additional new slot available on Multiplex D using the new compression techniques  The    hour channel  running from   am to midnight citation needed   became available on   December       Companies interested had until   November to submit their bids  with bids said to have reached     million  from an entry level of      million  with    separate bidders covering all sectors of broadcasting  This slot was won by Channel    it was occupied by More    until live coverage of Big Brother replaced it on    May       Film  took over the slot    July       Later compression technology  implemented in codecs like MPEG   H     or VC    can enable a substantial increase in either quality or capacity due to their increased efficiency  but use of such technologies would again require most viewers to purchase new reception equipment  since the vast majority of standard set top boxes support only the older MPEG  encoding  BSkyB were the first to suggest such a move to increase the number of channels available within their own share of space using MPEG  on a subscription service      However  BSkyB s proposals were ultimately shelved following regulatory delays      The BBC  which ultimately broadcast high definition television on Freeview in the DVB T  format adopted in       initially considered an alternative method utilising spare capacity at night to allow the download of high definition programmes for later replay  In addition the BBC s Research and Development team invented a transmission method that doubles the effective bandwidth that could currently be delivered by each multiplex using  spatial multiplexing   While conventional analogue and digital terrestrial television signals are transmitted either vertically or horizontally polarised  providing protection against interference from other distant signals which may be transmitted on the same frequency  but will usually be planned to use the opposite polarisation   the proposed technique would have involved using the same frequency to transmit two different signals at once  one vertically and one horizontally polarised  A special receiving aerial  containing both vertically and horizontally polarised elements  could receive both signals simultaneously and feed these to a suitable set top box  but would require new transmitters and receiving equipment and aerials  the technique was ultimately not adopted  citation needed   See also
