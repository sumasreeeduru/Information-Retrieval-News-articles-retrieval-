Journalismvte A blog  a truncation of  weblog      is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete  often informal diary style text entries  posts   Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order  so that the most recent post appears first  at the top of the web page  Until       blogs were usually the work of a single individual  citation needed  occasionally of a small group  and often covered a single subject or topic  In the     s   multi author blogs   MABs  emerged  featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited  MABs from newspapers  other media outlets  universities  think tanks  advocacy groups  and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic  The rise of Twitter and other  microblogging  systems helps integrate MABs and single author blogs into the news media  Blog can also be used as a verb  meaning to maintain or add content to a blog  The emergence and growth of blogs in the late     s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming  Previously  a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web  and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts  In the     s  the majority are interactive Web     websites  allowing visitors to leave online comments  and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites     In that sense  blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service  Indeed  bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers     However  there are high readership blogs which do not allow comments  Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic  ranging from politics to sports  Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company  A typical blog combines text  digital images  and links to other blogs  web pages  and other media related to its topic  The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments  and interact with other commenters  is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs  However  blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content  Most blogs are primarily textual  although some focus on art  art blogs   photographs  photoblogs   videos  video blogs or  vlogs    music  MP  blogs   and audio  podcasts   In education  blogs can be used as instructional resources  these are referred to as edublogs  Microblogging is another type of blogging  featuring very short posts   Blog  and  blogging  are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media  especially when the content is long form and one creates and shares content on regular basis  So  one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram  On February          update   there were over     million public blogs in existence  On February           there were around     million Tumblr    and      million WordPress    blogs in existence worldwide  According to critics and other bloggers  Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today  However  Blogger does not offer public statistics        Technorati lists     million blogs as of February               Contents    History

February          Main articles  History of blogging and online diary The term  weblog  was coined by Jorn Barger    on December           The short form   blog   was coined by Peter Merholz  who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme com in April or May                   Shortly thereafter  Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used  blog  as both a noun and verb   to blog   meaning  to edit one s weblog or to post to one s weblog   and devised the term  blogger  in connection with Pyra Labs  Blogger product  leading to the popularization of the terms       Origins Before blogging became popular  digital communities took many forms including Usenet  commercial online services such as GEnie  Byte Information Exchange  BIX  and the early CompuServe  e mail lists      and Bulletin Board Systems  BBS   In the     s  Internet forum software created running conversations with  threads   Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual  corkboard   From June           Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their  What s New      list of new websites  updated daily and archived monthly  The page was accessible by a special  What s New  button in the Mosaic web browser  The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in      by Ty  Inc   which featured a blog in a section called  Online Diary    The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors      The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives  Most such writers called themselves diarists  journalists  or journalers  Justin Hall  who began personal blogging in      while a student at Swarthmore College  is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers      as is Jerry Pournelle      Dave Winer s Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs          The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News     on their web site from       Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites  mostly in Australia  Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam  an online shared diary of a person s personal life combining text  digital video  and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in       This practice of semi automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance  and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters  Some early bloggers  such as The Misanthropic Bitch  who began in       actually referred to their online presence as a zine  before the term blog entered common usage   Technology Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites  In       the  Online Diary  on the Ty  Inc  Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available   Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day   To users  this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day   At the beginning of each new day  new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file  and the start of each month  diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month   Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site   This text based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later      The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically inclined population  Ultimately  this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today  For instance  the use of some sort of browser based software is now a typical aspect of  blogging   Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services  on regular web hosting services  or run using blog software   Rise in popularity After a slow start  blogging rapidly gained in popularity  Blog usage spread during      and the years following  being further popularized by the near simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools   Bruce Ableson launched Open Diary in October       which soon grew to thousands of online diaries  Open Diary innovated the reader comment  becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers  blog entries  Brad Fitzpatrick started LiveJournal in March       Andrew Smales created Pitas com in July      as an easier alternative to maintaining a  news page  on a Web site  followed by DiaryLand in September       focusing more on a personal diary community      Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan  Pyra Labs  launched Blogger com in August       purchased by Google in February       Political impact  On December          Josh Marshall s talkingpointsmemo com blog called attention to U S  Senator Lott s comments regarding Senator Thurmond  Senator Lott was eventually to resign his Senate leadership position over the matter  An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in       when many bloggers focused on comments by U S  Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott      Senator Lott  at a party honoring U S  Senator Strom Thurmond  praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president  Lott s critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation  a policy advocated by Thurmond s      presidential campaign  This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers   See Josh Marshall s Talking Points Memo   Though Lott s comments were made at a public event attended by the media  no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story  Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader  Similarly  blogs were among the driving forces behind the  Rathergate  scandal  To wit   television journalist  Dan Rather presented documents  on the CBS show    Minutes  that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush s military service record  Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view  Consequently  CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques  see Little Green Footballs   Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs  acceptance by the mass media  both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure  original research   The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination  Though often seen as partisan gossips  citation needed  bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light  with mainstream media having to follow their lead  More often  however  news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media  Meanwhile  an increasing number of experts blogged  making blogs a source of in depth analysis  original research   In Russia  some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official  overwhelmingly pro government media  Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter s nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the  party of crooks and thieves  has been adopted by anti regime protesters      This led to The Wall Street Journal calling Navalny  the man Vladimir Putin fears most  in March            Mainstream popularity By       the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream  as political consultants  news services  and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming  Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs  role as a news source   See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark   Even politicians not actively campaigning  such as the UK s Labour Party s MP Tom Watson  began to blog to bond with constituents  In January       Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people  could not ignore   Peter Rojas  Xeni Jardin  Ben Trott  Mena Trott  Jonathan Schwartz  Jason Goldman  Robert Scoble  and Jason Calacanis      Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog      Under David Saranga  the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web     initiatives  including an official video blog     and a political blog      The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas  with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference      The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik  the country s official political blog      The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments  In       the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy  resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area  Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government  U S  President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying  if the direction of the news is all blogosphere  all opinions  with no serious fact checking  no serious attempts to put stories in context  then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding       Between      and       an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded   Types  A screenshot from the BlogActive website  There are many different types of blogs  differing not only in the type of content  but also in the way that content is delivered or written   Personal blogs The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual  rather than a corporation or organization  While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers  other than the blogger s immediate family and friends  a small number of personal blogs have become popular  to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship  A tiny number of personal bloggers have become famous  both in the online community and in the real world  Collaborative blogs or group blogs A type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author   The majority of high profile collaborative blogs are based around a single uniting theme  such as politics  technology or advocacy   In recent years  the blogosphere has seen the emergence and growing popularity of more collaborative efforts  often set up by already established bloggers wishing to pool time and resources  both to reduce the pressure of maintaining a popular website and to attract a larger readership  Microblogging Microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital content which could be text  pictures  links  short videos  or other media on the Internet  Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users  It has captured the public imagination  in part because the short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting  Friends use it to keep in touch  business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources  and celebrities and politicians  or their publicists  microblog about concert dates  lectures  book releases  or tour schedules  A wide and growing range of add on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications  The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication      Examples of these include Twitter  Facebook  Tumblr and  by far the largest  WeiBo  Corporate and organizational blogs A blog can be private  as in most cases  or it can be for business or not for profit organization or government purposes  Blogs used internally  and only available to employees via an Intranet are called corporate blogs  Companies use internal corporate blogs enhance the communication  culture and employee engagement in a corporation  Internal corporate blogs can be used to communicate news about company policies or procedures  build employee esprit de corps and improve morale  Companies and other organizations also use external  publicly accessible blogs for marketing  branding  or public relations purposes  Some organizations have a blog authored by their executive  in practice  many of these executive blog posts are penned by a ghostwriter  who makes posts in the style of the credited author   Similar blogs for clubs and societies are called club blogs  group blogs  or by similar names  typical use is to inform members and other interested parties of club and member activities  Aggregated blogs Individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on specific topic  product or service and provide combined view for its readers  This allows readers to concentrate on reading instead of searching for quality on topic content and managing subscriptions  Many such aggregation called planets from name of Planet  software  that perform such aggregation  hosting sites usually have planet  subdomain in domain name  like http   planet gnome org    By genre Some blogs focus on a particular subject  such as political blogs  journalism blogs  health blogs  travel blogs  also known as travelogs   gardening blogs  house blogs  Book Blogs          fashion blogs  beauty blogs  lifestyle blogs  party blogs  wedding blogs  photography blogs  project blogs  psychology blogs  sociology blogs  education blogs  niche blogs  classical music blogs  quizzing blogs  legal blogs  often referred to as a blawgs   or dreamlogs  How to Tutorial blogs are becoming increasing popular      Two common types of genre blogs are art blogs and music blogs  A blog featuring discussions especially about home and family is not uncommonly called a mom blog and one made popular is by Erica Diamond who created Womenonthefence com which is syndicated to over two million readers monthly                          While not a legitimate type of blog  one used for the sole purpose of spamming is known as a splog  By media type A blog comprising videos is called a vlog  one comprising links is called a linklog  a site containing a portfolio of sketches is called a sketchblog or one comprising photos is called a photoblog  Blogs with shorter posts and mixed media types are called tumblelogs  Blogs that are written on typewriters and then scanned are called typecast or typecast blogs  A rare type of blog hosted on the Gopher Protocol is known as a phlog  By device A blog can also be defined by which type of device is used to compose it  A blog written by a mobile device like a mobile phone or PDA could be called a moblog      One early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam  an online shared diary of a person s personal life combining text  video  and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site  This practice of semi automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance  Such journals have been used as evidence in legal matters  citation needed  Reverse blog A reverse blog is composed by its users rather than a single blogger  This system has the characteristics of a blog  and the writing of several authors  These can be written by several contributing authors on a topic  or opened up for anyone to write  There is typically some limit to the number of entries to keep it from operating like a web forum  citation needed  Community and cataloging  An artist s depiction of the interconnections between blogs and blog authors in the  blogosphere  in       Blogosphere The collective community of all blogs and blog authors  particularly notable and widely read blogs  is known as the blogosphere  Since all blogs are on the internet by definition  they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked  through blogrolls  comments  linkbacks  refbacks  trackbacks or pingbacks   and backlinks  Discussions  in the blogosphere  are occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues  Because new  untapped communities of bloggers and their readers can emerge in the space of a few years  Internet marketers pay close attention to  trends in the blogosphere       Blog search engines Several blog search engines have been used to search blog contents  such as Bloglines  BlogScope  and Technorati  Technorati was one of the more popular blog search engines  but the website stopped indexing blogs and assigning authority scores in May       The research community is working on going beyond simple keyword search  by inventing new ways to navigate through huge amounts of information present in the blogosphere  as demonstrated by projects like BlogScope  which was shut down in       citation needed  Blogging communities and directories Several online communities exist that connect people to blogs and bloggers to other bloggers  Some of these communities include Indiblogger  Blogadda  Blog Chatter  BlogCatalog and MyBlogLog      Interest specific blogging platforms are also available  For instance  Blogster has a sizable community of political bloggers among its members  Global Voices aggregates international bloggers   with emphasis on voices that are not ordinarily heard in international mainstream media       Blogging and advertising It is common for blogs to feature banner advertisements or promotional content  either to financially benefit the blogger  support website hosting costs  or to promote the blogger s favorite causes or products  The popularity of blogs has also given rise to  fake blogs  in which a company will create a fictional blog as a marketing tool to promote a product      As the popularity of blogging continues to rise  the commercialisation of blogging is rapidly increasing  Many corporations and companies collaborate with bloggers to increase advertising and engage online communities towards their products  In the book Fans  Bloggers  and Gamers  Henry Jenkins stated that  Bloggers take knowledge in their own hands  enabling successful navigation within and between these emerging knowledge cultures  One can see such behaviour as co optation into commodity culture insofar as it sometimes collaborates with corporate interests  but one can also see it as increasing the diversity of media culture  providing opportunities for greater inclusiveness  and making more responsive to consumers        Popularity This section needs to be updated  Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information   April       As of      update   blogging had become such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day      Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular  There are essentially two measures of this  popularity through citations  as well as popularity through affiliation  i e   blogroll   The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls  permalinks can boost popularity more quickly  and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls  since they denote that people are actually reading the blog s content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases      The blogdex project was launched by researchers in the MIT Media Lab to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs to investigate their social properties  Information was gathered by the tool for over four years  during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community  ranking it by recency and popularity  It can  therefore  original research   be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker  The project was replaced by tailrank com which in turn has been replaced by spinn r com  Blogs are given rankings by Alexa Internet  web hits of Alexa Toolbar users   and formerly by blog search engine Technorati based on the number of incoming links  Technorati stopped doing this in        In August       Technorati found that the most linked to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress Xu Jinglei      Chinese media Xinhua reported that this blog received more than    million page views  claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world      Technorati rated Boing Boing to be the most read group written blog       Blurring with the mass media Many bloggers  particularly those engaged in participatory journalism  are amateur journalists  and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations  Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online  rather than via a TV station or newspaper  either as an add on to a traditional media presence  e g   hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper   or as their sole journalistic output  Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of  getting around the filter  of media  gatekeepers  and pushing their messages directly to the public  Many mainstream journalists  meanwhile  write their own blogs well over      according to CyberJournalist net s J blog list  citation needed  The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August       when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie      Some bloggers have moved over to other media  The following bloggers  and others  have appeared on radio and television  Duncan Black  known widely by his pseudonym  Atrios   Glenn Reynolds  Instapundit   Markos Moulitsas Z niga  Daily Kos   Alex Steffen  Worldchanging   Ana Marie Cox  Wonkette   Nate Silver  FiveThirtyEight com   and Ezra Klein  Ezra Klein blog in The American Prospect  now in The Washington Post     In counterpoint  Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction  adding to his reach in  old media  by being an influential blogger  Similarly  it was Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona s attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge          Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages  bringing together scattered speakers and learners  this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages  Minority language publishing  which may lack economic feasibility  can find its audience through inexpensive blogging  There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs  e g   Salam Pax  Ellen Simonetti  Jessica Cutler  ScrappleFace  Blog based books have been given the name blook  A prize for the best blog based book was initiated in           the Lulu Blooker Prize      However  success has been elusive offline  with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs  The book based on Julie Powell s blog  The Julie Julia Project  was made into the film Julie   Julia  apparently the first to do so   Consumer generated advertising Consumer generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development  and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers  Among the various forms of advertising on blog  the most controversial are the sponsored posts      These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback  reviews  opinion  videos  etc  and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords  Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model  where companies can skip over the advertising agencies  previously the only interface with the customer  and contact the customers directly via social media websites  On the other hand  new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established  to take advantage of this new development as well  However  there are many people who look negatively on this new development  Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere s credibility       Legal and social consequences  Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences       Defamation or liability Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability  U S  payouts related to blogging totaled       million by       in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance      The courts have returned with mixed verdicts  Internet Service Providers  ISPs   in general  are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties  U S  Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive         EC   In Doe v  Cahill  the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers  and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself  as unfounded under American libel law  rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration      In a bizarre twist  the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe  who turned out to be the person they suspected  the town s mayor  Councilman Cahill s political rival  The Cahills amended their original complaint  and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial  In January       two prominent Malaysian political bloggers  Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan  were sued by a pro government newspaper  The New Straits Times Press  Malaysia  Berhad  Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan  Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a l John Pereira over an alleged defamation  The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government      Following the suit  the Malaysian government proposed to  register  all bloggers in Malaysia to better control parties against their interest      This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country  In the United States  blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in           According to Wired magazine  Traffic Power had been  banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results       Wall and other  white hat  search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public  The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction  and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time      In       NDTV issued a legal notice to Indian blogger Kunte for a blog post criticizing their coverage of the Mumbai attacks      The blogger unconditionally withdrew his post  which resulted in several Indian bloggers criticizing NDTV for trying to silence critics       Employment Employees who blog about elements of their place of employment can begin to affect the reputation of their employer  either in a positive way  if the employee is praising the employer and its workplaces  or in a negative way  if the blogger is making negative comments about the company or its practices  In general  attempts by employee bloggers to protect themselves by maintaining anonymity have proved ineffective      In       a controversial and landmark decision by The Hon  Mr Justice Eady refused to grant an order to protect the anonymity of Richard Horton   Horton was a police officer in the United Kingdom who blogged about his job under the name  NightJack       Delta Air Lines fired flight attendant Ellen Simonetti because she posted photographs of herself in uniform on an airplane and because of comments posted on her blog  Queen of Sky  Diary of a Flight Attendant  which the employer deemed inappropriate          This case highlighted the issue of personal blogging and freedom of expression versus employer rights and responsibilities  and so it received wide media attention  Simonetti took legal action against the airline for  wrongful termination  defamation of character and lost future wages       The suit was postponed while Delta was in bankruptcy proceedings      In early       Erik Ringmar  a senior lecturer at the London School of Economics  was ordered by the convenor of his department to  take down and destroy  his blog in which he discussed the quality of education at the school      Mark Jen was terminated in      after    days of employment as an assistant product manager at Google for discussing corporate secrets on his personal blog  then called   zeros and hosted on the Google owned Blogger service      He blogged about unreleased products and company finances a week before the company s earnings announcement  He was fired two days after he complied with his employer s request to remove the sensitive material from his blog      In India  blogger Gaurav Sabnis resigned from IBM after his posts questioned the claims made by a management school      Jessica Cutler  aka  The Washingtonienne   blogged about her sex life while employed as a congressional assistant  After the blog was discovered and she was fired      she wrote a novel based on her experiences and blog  The Washingtonienne  A Novel  As of      update   Cutler is being sued by one of her former lovers in a case that could establish the extent to which bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of their real life associates      Catherine Sanderson  a k a  Petite Anglaise  lost her job in Paris at a British accountancy firm because of blogging      Although given in the blog in a fairly anonymous manner  some of the descriptions of the firm and some of its people were less than flattering  Sanderson later won a compensation claim case against the British firm  however      On the other hand  Penelope Trunk wrote an upbeat article in The Boston Globe in       entitled  Blogs  essential  to a good career       She was one of the first journalists to point out that a large portion of bloggers are professionals and that a well written blog can help attract employers   Business owners Business owners who blog about their business can also run into legal consequences  Mark Cuban  owner of the Dallas Mavericks  was fined during the      NBA playoffs for criticizing NBA officials on the court and in his blog       Political dangers See also  Political repression of cyber dissidents Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas  In some countries  Internet police or secret police may monitor blogs and arrest blog authors of commentators  Blogs can be much harder to control than broadcast or print media  because a person can create a blog whose authorship is hard to trace  by using anonymity technology such as Tor  As a result  totalitarian and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs and or to punish those who maintain them  In Singapore  two ethnic Chinese individuals were imprisoned under the country s anti sedition law for posting anti Muslim remarks in their blogs      Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer was charged with insulting the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and an Islamic institution through his blog  It is the first time in the history of Egypt that a blogger was prosecuted  After a brief trial session that took place in Alexandria  the blogger was found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three years for insulting Islam and inciting sedition  and one year for insulting Mubarak      Egyptian
