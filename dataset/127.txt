second commercial network in the UK  However  the name resurfaced in the late     s for very different reasons  The launch of digital terrestrial television services in the UK saw each existing analogue terrestrial broadcaster given a slice of bandwidth with which to carry their existing service after analogue switch off with space left over for new channels  Whilst strictly speaking this space belonged to each regional contractor for use within their own region  ITV had undergone a series of buy outs earlier on in the decade  the three players operating the majority of the network  Granada  Carlton  and United News   Media  jointly launched ITV  in      to be broadcast to most of the country as a uniform service  Whilst free to air  it was marketed alongside their own subscription based ONdigital platform  Other ITV licensees  SMG  UTV and GMTV launched their own services in the space  see below   While ITV  is now a popular entertainment channel  at its launch in      it was a mixed genre channel  Much of the original content in its launch schedule was current affairs related programming fronted by ITV newscasters  Katie Derham presented a weekly media programme called Wide Angle  John Suchet fronted a weekly current affairs discussion programme called Who  What  Why  and Trevor McDonald presented an interview series  Trevor McDonald Meets        Other programmes included Midsomer Murders  Inspector Morse  Judge Judy  omnibus editions of ITV soaps Emmerdale and Coronation Street  and a Saturday football results service     In June       ITV plc announced that they were going to double the channel s programme budget  and would add more American series and movies  On   November       in an attempt to launch ITV  on Sky  ITV  moved from     to     on Sky after ITV plc bought GSkyB for     million  As a result  Plus was permanently closed down  with its EPG slot taken by ITV   ITV plc launched a one hour timeshift channel of ITV  on Monday     October       The company is looking to its digital channels to shore up revenues as the ITV Network suffers a decline in viewers  ITV     was launched on the same day  ITV  and its one hour timeshift channel began broadcasting    hours a day on    March          From    January       ITV     on the Freeview platform has changed its broadcasting hours to      pm until      am On   June       an additional hour was added in England  Northern Ireland and Scotland  allowing ITV     to start at      pm On   August       ITV     began to broadcast    hours a day on Freeview across the UK  using an eleventh stream created on mux A  As part of the changes  ITV     swapped slots on Sky s electronic programme guide with Men   Motors  resulting in the timeshift channel making a significant jump from channel     to      It is now Sky      GMTV  programming moved from ITV  to ITV   The strand continues to be simulcast on the CITV channel  On    August       ITV  unveiled a new look  The logo was given a  D look  with six new idents  ITV  was launched on UPC Ireland in the Republic of Ireland on   January       marking the first time the channel has been officially available in the country  The channel had already been  and remains  available to Irish viewers on free to air satellite for some time  however it is still not listed in the Sky electronic programme guide  On   April       ITV  was removed from UPC Ireland along with ITV  and ITV  due to the expiry of a carriage agreement between UPC and ITV     UPC Ireland claim that ITV is not in a position to renegotiate the deal because ITV had struck a deal with another channel provider to provide it with exclusive rights to air certain content from the channels  Conversely  UPC Ireland also claims to have been in discussions right up to the last moment to continue broadcasting the channels     ITV   ITV  and ITV  were restored to the UPC Ireland line up on    December       TV  and its sister channel  e already hold carriage agreement to air certain ITV content within the Republic of Ireland  alternatively UTV is available within the Republic  ITV  is available along with ITV  and ITV  within

Edinburgh International Television Festival in            Criticisms edit  In       the channel was subject to a controversy about one of its shows  Dapper Laughs  On The Pull was created by Vine comedian Daniel O Reilly  The show was criticized for promoting violence against women     and dubbed by one paper as  a rapist s almanac   Due to these criticisms  an online petition for the show s cancellation reaching        signatures     and a sexist joke glorifying rape said by O Reilly during one of his live shows      ITV chose not to commission a second series  A subsequent live tour was also cancelled          In the wake of the scandal  Stewart Lee criticized the host s Newsnight apology and said  what kind of person gets banned from ITV   That s like being banned from a pub that s on fire   In a      episode of Screenwipe  Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker criticized the channel s programming for being nihilistic and called it  a monument to cultural death  and  frighteningly meaningless        Subsidiary channels edit  ITV     edit  ITV     launched    October      along with ITV     it was allocated channel number     on Sky  on   May      it was announced

by the national variant   Branding edit  When the channel launched  the logo was very similar in style to the ITV logo at the time and ITV were worried the channel looked just like an extension of ITV and didn t offer anything new  It was soon after this that the channel received a complete overhaul along with the other ITV channels in       The channel received a new lime green logo  chosen as ITV thought it had a young fresh feel to it  The channel also received six new idents which all had names beginning with  Too  to relate to the   in the channel s name  They were called   Too Fast    Too
