published news   These values help explain what makes something  newsworthy      Initially labelled  news factors   news values are widely credited to Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge     In their seminal      study     Galtung and Ruge put forward a system of twelve factors describing events that together are used as defining  newsworthiness   Focusing on newspapers and broadcast news  Galtung and Ruge devised a list describing what they believed were significant contributing factors as to how the news is constructed  They proposed a  chain of news communication         which involves processes of selection  the more an event satisfies the  news factors   the more likely it is selected as news   distortion  accentuating the newsworthy factors of the event  once it has been selected   and replication  selection and distortion are repeated at all steps in the chain from event to reader   Furthermore  three basic hypotheses are presented by Galtung and Ruge  the additivity hypothesis that the more factors an event satisfies  the higher the probability that it becomes news  the complementary hypothesis that the factors will tend to exclude each other  and the exclusion hypothesis that events that satisfy none or very few factors will not become news    News values are not universal and can vary between different cultures  Among the many lists of news values that have been drawn up by scholars and journalists  some attempt to describe news practices across cultures  while others have become remarkably specific to the press of certain  often Western  nations  In Western practice  decisions on the selection and prioritization of news are made by editors on the basis of their experience and intuition  although analysis by Galtung and Ruge showed that several factors are consistently applied across a range of news organizations  Their theory was tested on the news presented in four different Norwegian newspapers from the Congo and Cuba crises of July      and the Cyprus crisis of March April       Results were mainly consistent with their theory and hypotheses     Johan Galtung later said that the media have misconstrued his work and become far too negative  sensational  and adversarial     In       the influential      study was updated by Tony Harcup and Deirdre O Neill  in a study of the British press  The findings of a content analysis of three major national newspapers in the UK were used to critically evaluate Galtung and Ruge s original criteria and to propose a contemporary set of news values  Forty years on  they found some notable differences  including the rise of celebrity news and that good news  as well as bad news  was a significant news value  as well as the newspaper s own agenda  They examined three tabloid newspapers     Methodologically and conceptually  news values can be approached from four different perspectives  material  focusing on the material reality of events   cognitive  focusing on people s beliefs and value systems   social  focusing on journalistic practice   and discursive  focusing on the discourse      A discursive perspective tries to systematically examine how news values such as Negativity  Proximity  Eliteness  and others  are constructed through words and images in published news stories  This approach is influenced by linguistics and social semiotics  and is called  discursive news values analysis   DNVA      It focuses on the  distortion  step in Galtung and Ruge s chain of news communication  by analysing how events are discursively constructed as newsworthy  In a rapidly evolving market  achieving relevance  giving audiences the news they want and find interesting  is an increasingly important goal for media outlets seeking to maintain market share  This has made news organizations more open to audience input and feedback  and forced them to adopt and apply news values that attract and keep audiences  Given these changes and the rapid rise of digital technology in recent years  Harcup and O Neill updated their      study in          while other scholars have analysed news values in viral news shared via social media     The growth of interactive media and citizen journalism is fast altering the traditional distinction between news producer and passive audience and may in future lead to a redefinition of what  news  means and the role of the news industry   Contents    List of news values   Audience perceptions of news   Evolutionary perspectives   See also   Notes   References   External links   List of news values edit  A variety of external and internal pressures influence journalistic decisions during the news making process  which can sometimes lead to bias or unethical reporting  Many different factors have the potential to influence whether an event is first noticed by a news organisation  second whether a story will be written about that event  third  how that story is written  and fourth whether this story will end up being published as news and if so  where it is placed  Therefore   there is no end to lists of news criteria      There are multiple competing lists of news values  including Galtung   Ruge s news factors  and others put forward by Schlesinger      Bell      Bednarek   Caple      with considerable overlap but also disagreement as to what should be included      News values can relate to aspects of events and actors  or to aspects of news gathering and processing      Values in news actors and events   Frequency  Events that occur suddenly and fit well with the news organization s schedule are more likely to be reported than those that occur gradually or at inconvenient times of day or night  Long term trends are not likely to receive much coverage  Timeliness  Events that have only just happened  are current  ongoing  or are about to happen are newsworthy     Familiarity  To do with people or places close to the target audience  Others prefer the term Proximity for this news value  which includes geographical and cultural proximity  see  meaningfulness       Negativity  Bad news is more newsworthy than good news  Sometimes described as  the basic news value       Conversely  it has also been suggested that Positivity is a news value in certain cases  such as sports news  science news  feel good tabloid stories   Conflict  Opposition of people or forces resulting in a dramatic effect  Events with conflict are often quite newsworthy  Sometimes included in Negativity rather than listed as a separate news value     Unexpectedness  Events that are out of the ordinary  unexpected  or rare are more newsworthy than routine  unsurprising events         Unambiguity  Events whose implications are clear make for better copy than those that are open to more than one interpretation  or where any understanding of the implications depends on first understanding the complex background in which the events take place      Personalization  Events that can be portrayed as the actions of individuals will be more attractive than one in which there is no such  human interest   Personalization is about whether an event can be contextualised in personal terms  affecting or involving specific   ordinary  people  not the generalised masses   Meaningfulness  This relates to the sense of identification the audience has with the topic   Cultural proximity  is a factor here events concerned with people who speak the same language  look the same  and share the same preoccupations as the audience receive more coverage than those concerned with people who speak different languages  look different and have different preoccupations  A related term is Relevance  which is about the relevance of the event as regards the target readers  viewers  own lives or how close it is to their experiences  Impact refers more generally to an event s impact  on the target audience  or on others  An event with significant consequences  high impact  is newsworthy     Eliteness  Events concerned with global powers receive more attention than those concerned with less influential nations  Events concerned with the rich  powerful  famous and infamous get more coverage  Also includes the eliteness of sources   sometimes called Attribution      Superlativeness  Events with a large scale or scope or with high intensity are newsworthy         Consonance  Events that fit with the media s expectations and preconceptions receive more coverage than those that defy them  and for which they are thus unprepared   Note this appears to conflict with unexpectedness above  However  consonance really refers to the media s readiness to report an item  Consonance has also been defined as relating to editors  stereotypes and their mental scripts for how events typically proceed      Values in the news process   Continuity  A story that is already in the news gathers a kind of inertia  This is partly because the media organizations are already in place to report the story  and partly because previous reportage may have made the story more accessible to the public  making it less ambiguous   Composition  Stories must compete with one another for space in the media  For instance  editors may seek to provide a balance of different types of coverage  so that if there is an excess of foreign news for instance  the least important foreign story may have to make way for an item concerned with the domestic news  In this way the prominence given to a story depends not only on its own news values but also on those of competing stories     Competition  Commercial or professional competition between media may lead journalists to endorse the news value given to a story by a rival  Co option   A story that is only marginally newsworthy in its own right may be covered if it is related to a major running story      Prefabrication   A story that is marginal in news terms but written and available may be selected ahead of a much more newsworthy story that must be researched and written from the ground up      Predictability   An event is more likely to be covered if it has been pre scheduled      Story impact  The impact of a published story  not the event   for example whether it is being shared widely  sometimes called Shareability   read  liked  commented on  To be qualified as shareable  a story arguably has to be simple  emotional  unexpected and triggered  Engaging with such analytics is now an important part of newsroom practice  Time constraints   Traditional news media such as radio  television and daily newspapers have strict deadlines and a short production cycle  which selects for items that can be researched and covered quickly  Logistics  Although eased by the availability of global communications even from remote regions  the ability to deploy and control production and reporting staff  and functionality of technical resources can determine whether a story is covered      Data  Media need to back up all of their stories with data in order to remain relevant and reliable  Reporters prefer to look at raw data in order to be able to take an unbiased perspective  An alternative term is Facticity   the favouring of facts and figures in hard news      One of the key differences in relation to these news values is whether they relate to events or stories  For example  composition and co option both relate to the published news story  These are news values that concern how news stories fit with the other stories around them  The aim here is to ensure a balanced spread of stories with minimal duplication across a news program or edition      Such news values are qualitatively different from news values that relate to aspects of events  such as Eliteness  the elite status of news actors or sources  or Proximity  the closeness of the event s location to the target audience    Audience perceptions of news edit  Conventional models concentrate on what the journalist perceives as news  But the news process is a two way transaction  involving both news producer  the journalist  and the news receiver  the audience   although the boundary between the two is rapidly blurring with the growth of citizen journalism and interactive media  Little has been done to define equivalent factors that determine audience perception of news  This is largely because it would appear impossible to define a common factor  or factors  that generate interest in a mass audience  Basing his judgement on many years as a newspaper journalist Hetherington states that      anything  which threatens people s peace  prosperity and well being is news and likely to make headlines       Whyte Venables suggests audiences may interpret news as a risk signal      Psychologists and primatologists have shown that apes and humans constantly monitor the environment for information that may signal the possibility of physical danger or threat to the individual s social position  This receptiveness to risk signals is a powerful and virtually universal survival mechanism  A  risk signal  is characterized by two factors  an element of change  or uncertainty  and the relevance of that change to the security of the individual  The same two conditions are observed to be characteristic of news  The news value of a story  if defined in terms of the interest it carries for an audience  is determined by the degree of change it contains and the relevance that change has for the individual or group  Analysis shows that journalists and publicists manipulate both the element of change and relevance   security concern   to maximize  or some cases play down  the strength of a story  Security concern is proportional to the relevance of the story for the individual  his or her family  social group and societal group  in declining order   At some point there is a Boundary of Relevance  beyond which the change is no longer perceived to be relevant  or newsworthy   This boundary may be manipulated by journalists  power elites and communicators seeking to encourage audiences to exclude  or embrace  certain groups  for instance  to distance a home audience from the enemy in time of war  or conversely  to highlight the plight of a distant culture so as to encourage support for aid programs      In       Hal Pashler and Gail Heriot published a study showing that perceptions of newsworthiness tend to be contaminated by a political usefulness bias  In other words  individuals tend to view stories that give them  ammunition  for their political views as more newsworthy  They give credence to their own views       Evolutionary perspectives edit  An evolutionary psychology explanation for why negative news have a higher news value than positive news starts with the empirical observation that the human perceptive system and lower level brain functions have difficulty distinguishing between media stimuli and real stimuli  These lower level brain mechanisms which function on a subconscious level make basic evaluations of perceptive stimuli  focus attention on important stimuli  and start basic emotional reactions  Research has also found that the brain differentiates between negative and positive stimuli and reacts quicker and more automatically to negative stimuli which are also better remembered  This likely has evolutionary explanations with it often being important to quickly focus attention on  evaluate  and quickly respond to threats  While the reaction to a strong negative stimulus is to avoid  a moderately negative stimulus instead causes curiosity and further examination  Negative media news is argued to fall into the latter category which explains their popularity  Lifelike audiovisual media are argued to have particularly strong effects compared to reading      Women have on average stronger avoidance reactions to moderately negative stimuli  Men and women also differ on average in how they enjoy  evaluate  remember  comprehend  and identify with the people in news depending on if the news are negatively or positively framed  The stronger avoidance reaction to moderately negative stimuli has been explained as it being the role of men in evolutionary history to investigate and potentially respond aggressively to threats while women and children withdrew  It has been claimed that negative news are framed according to male preferences by the often male journalists who cover such news and that a more positive framing may attract a larger female audience      However  other scholars have urged caution as regards evolutionary psychology s claims about gender differences       See also edit   Afghanistanism Agenda setting theory News bias Mass media impact on spatial perception Media
