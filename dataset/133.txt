DVB S  from mid      and via terrestrial transmissions  DVB T  from mid       Freeview s marketing campaign began on    April      through a website and through four television advertisements shown on Freeview s shareholders  TV channels  using the slogan  Make bad reception a thing of the past   and showing people using proverbial substitutes for rabbit ears for receiving TV reception  Since       M ori comedian Pio Terei has been the advertising face of Freeview  Freeview s satellite service began on   May      with five television channels  TV One  TV   TV   C   and M ori Television  Freeview

channels above     MHz should never have been allocated due to the planned reallocation of the     MHz spectrum for LTE mobile networks     a b Due to the lack of a well defined numbering system  administrated and encoded by TVNZ   the digital terrestrial Christchurch only Kordia service CTV falls into the    to    range  even though there are unused numbers in the         range and the Cue TV digital terrestrial Invercargill only service  which started after the nationwide satellite service   used the    to    range on both platforms    MHEG Interaction Channel edit  MHEG IC channels are from LCN     to      From      it is mandatory for all TVs over   inch and PVRs to include IP based MHEG Interaction Channel  It s optional on receivers to ensure that a lower cost option is available as New Zealand heads towards DSO     In October       Worldnet TV launched the first commercial MHEG IC channel in New Zealand and was added to JDA regional sites as an MHEG IC application on LCN     which includes seven live streams        As of    October       live channels include NHK World  Arirang TV  MBC  Yonhap  MBN  HiTV  and BTN   Metadata edit  Freeview has its own eight day electronic programme guide  EPG   named Freeview EPG  TVNZ s Teletext service was also available until it was discontinued in April          The EPG via the satellite service provides an eight day schedule with programme details on both a traditional EIT and MHEG   application  whereas the EPG via the terrestrial service has limited programme details via the traditional EIT with full details available only via the MHEG   application     For all certified NZ Freeview  also all Australian  Freeview EPG  branded  receivers to activate the MHEG   EPG  the receiver must remap the remote control s guide button to be an extended function key for use by MHEG   applications which are normally limited to the four coloured buttons for launching functions   This is more common on terrestrial than on satellite due to the differences in launch dates   Receivers that do this make the traditional EIT function useless  which is why independent local broadcasters  such as the Hawke s Bay s TVHB  have to pay Freeview to include their scheduling details within the Freeview guide    Broadcasters within the UK do not have this problem as they only use the traditional EIT with MHEG   s use limited to interactive services such as the Red Button Teletext replacement and internet streaming services  During the third week of December       TVNZ tested using the same Huffman look up tables the BBC implemented to force viewers to use approved Freeview receivers that restrict HD recording and viewing   The Huffman tables are being used to compress the EIT text used for terrestrial schedule event names and descriptions   From March       TVNZ began compressing the EIT schedule again  Compressing the EIT text in the schedule would not achieve the same receiver use given the terrestrial EIT only has limited programme details   Receivers that don t use the BBC huffman tables will either display no details or display garbage characters  The assigned identifiers managed by TVNZ and Kordia on

SD channels  The TVNZ Sport Extra channel    was temporarily provided for the      Olympics  the space on DVB S was later used by a regional version of TV One  The Auckland based STRATOS channel    was discontinued due to service fee increases that occurred when its ratings increased  it was later replaced by ChoiceTV   STRATOS later reemerged on pay TV under the name Face TV  TVNZ   and   were discontinued due to the government provided funding coming to an end and were respectively  replaced by U and an hour delay of TV One  TVNZ U was replaced by an hour delay of TV  in       Trackside

Tauranga  and TV Rotorua both on    April        Other broadcasters edit  Freeview will be open to other free to air broadcasters if they want to join  According to Kordia there is space for approximately only    channels on the two satellite transponders that Freeview leases as of      update   However at      MBd with a FEC of     one    MHz frequency can only accommodate either six SD     H     QPSK channels or four HD      H      PSK channels while maintaining an optimal bit rate   Quality edit  Satellite transmissions are broadcast in    i  but the satellite transponder is high definition capable  Terrestrial transmissions can be broadcast in high definition  and the government lets the broadcasters decide whether to broadcast in high definition or to continue in standard definition  Six channels currently broadcast in high definition  TVNZ    TVNZ    TVNZ DUKE  Three  Maori Television and Te Reo in     i      Freeview satellite broadcasts have declined in quality since the service launched as TV ONE and TV  are now being broadcast many times to provide region specific advertisements  this reduces the bandwidth available to other channels on that frequency      From July       Mediaworks deregionalised TV  so that it uses   SD channel alongside its HD channel  The TVNZ frequency currently has   SD channels while the Discovery one has    TV channels and   radio channels   Technology edit  UHF terrestrial broadcasting using DVB T H      also known as DVB T HD       and currently covers    percent of the country s population  Only three towns with a population over        do not have terrestrial service  Queenstown  pop           Blenheim  pop          and Whakat ne  pop           In addition  Oamaru  pop          has limited terrestrial service through local station    South TV  while coverage of Cambridge  pop          is intermittent as hills partially block the signal from Te Aroha transmitter and Hamilton Towers transmitter is not powerful enough     watts  to reach the town  Freeview s terrestrial transmissions are broadcast from Kordia s and JDA s transmitter towers  Freeview uses the DVB T ODFM standard for terrestrial transmission  as established in      with NZS           to avoid the multipath problem caused by New Zealand s rugged topography  ATSC  the rival US standard that uses   VSB modulation  had a number of first gen  demodulators that couldn t handle multipath well  so it was not chosen      Terrestrial Freeview is broadcast in H      which unlike H     has an expensive transmission patent licensing tax for free TV and subscription use  People who took part in the Auckland digital trial using terrestrial H     receivers needed to change their receivers to more expensive H     models in order to receive terrestrial Freeview  DVB T H     is also known in other countries as DVB T HD  due to H     being used for SD  Currently the government owned TVNZ and Kordia which operate the H     re compression multiplexers are failing to fully meet the in Good Standing payments to be included in the licensees listing   MHEG   is used for the electronic programming guide  MHEG   support is built by the UK s Strategy and Technology who provided the similar applications for the BBC s Red Button and terrestrial internet streaming platform  Freeview Satellite uses the Optus D  satellite to broadcast  on two transponders  leased from Kordia  The satellite transmissions utilise H     video  Freeview cannot easily move to H     video broadcasting in the future as the encoding is unsupported by a large number of the receivers in the Freeview Satellite install base  also the additional patent licensing tax would make the satellite service even more expensive for channel operators  Unlike the terrestrial service  the satellite service broadcasts a more useful traditional DVB EPG alongside the functionally limited MHEG   EPG  Freeview had discussed with Telecom about the provision of IPTV over ADSL until it was shelved due to bandwidth and availability limitations       Certification edit  Freeview certifies set top boxes but does not sell them  they are marketed by electronics retailers      Freeview certification centres the localisation of multimedia data  primarily for the electronic programming guide  EPG    This data is broadcast over DVB using the MHEG   standard  At the moment this is only used to transmit EPG data  Freeview Record certification of digital video recorders is similar to Freeview certification  but also includes dual tuner with smart conflict resolution including alternate recordings of repeat programmes and one touch series recording from the EPG  Full fast forward and rewind cuing is available while an automatic ad skip function is not allowed  For copyrighted HD content  only devices that comply with studio DTCP are allowed to externally transfer content while all SD content is transferable  There are no time limits on content playback  As of May       there are currently two certified MyFreeview Satellite receivers available  which are from the New Zealand based Dish TV company  MHEG   is used exclusively for a full   day terrestrial broadcast schedule as Freeview do not fully populate the DVB EIT EPG  this means there are few uncertified terrestrial receivers on the market able to run the MHEG   Freeview EPG application  An uncertified terrestrial DVR would have to know the specific files to extract from the DSM CC stream to support a full EPG  Freeview certification requires set top boxes to disallow high definition video output over connections that do not support HDCP  In practice this means nearly all HD CRT televisions sold in New Zealand and many early flat screen televisions can only receive high definition from an uncertified set top box  which can output high definition over HDCP free connections like component cables or on HDMI without HDCP  Digital TV Labs is an officially approved test centre for Freeview New Zealand conformance testing  where manufacturers wishing to deploy devices with the associated Freeview  New Zealand logos and access to the Freeview EPG can obtain pass reports  There are also many non certified options are available   These and other FTA receivers have no limit on advert skipping nor restrict access to the recorded files or prevent streaming of recordings to other devices  Ultraplus X     HD PVR  Vu  Duo  Xcruiser XDSR   HD PVR are all examples of units that are or have been sold in NZ and have all of this capability  They can also receive

transition to digital      the companies involved will pay the remaining     million  Canterbury TV estimates it will need to pay NZ   million a year if it joins Freeview      The government claims a NZ     million benefit to the economy       Competition edit  SKY had a  free to air  package where channels similar to the ones available on Freeview were available for a monthly fee of NZ        plus an installation fee of NZ         Around        people used this service  generally those who cannot get a high quality signal from analogue terrestrial television      SKY has been relatively
