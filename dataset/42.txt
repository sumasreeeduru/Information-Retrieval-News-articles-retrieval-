See also  Etymology of Tunis The word Tunisia is derived from Tunis  a central urban hub and the capital of modern day Tunisia  The present form of the name  with its Latinate suffix  ia  evolved from French Tunisie      in turn generally associated with the Berber root      transcribed tns  which means  to lay down  or  encampment       It is sometimes also associated with the Punic goddess Tanith  aka Tunit           ancient city of Tynes          The French derivative Tunisie was adopted in some European languages with slight modifications  introducing a distinctive name to designate the country  Other languages remained untouched  such as the Russian         Tun s  and Spanish T nez  In this case  the same name is used for both country and city  as with the Arabic        and only by context can one tell the difference      Before Tunisia  the territory s name was Ifriqiya or Africa  which gave the present day name of the continent Africa   History edit  Main article  History of

that Africa was originally populated by Gaetulians and Libyans  both nomadic peoples   According to the Roman historian Sallust  the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land  with some migrating to Africa  Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians  The Medes settled and were known as Mauri  later Moors        Carthaginian held territory before the first First Punic War The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended  The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi nomadic until the reign of Masinissa of the Massyli tribe              At the beginning of recorded history  Tunisia was inhabited by Berber tribes  Its coast was settled by Phoenicians starting as early as the   th century BC  Bizerte  Utica   The city of Carthage was founded in the  th century BC by Phoenicians  Legend says that Dido from Tyre  now in modern day Lebanon  founded the city in     BC  as retold by the Greek writer Timaeus of Tauromenium  The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia  now present day Lebanon and adjacent areas      After the series of wars with Greek city states of Sicily in the  th century BC  Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western Mediterranean  The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including Baal and Tanit  Tanit s symbol  a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress  is a popular icon found in ancient sites  The founders of Carthage also established a Tophet  which was altered in Roman times  A Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by Hannibal during the Second Punic War  one of a series of wars with Rome  nearly crippled the rise of Roman power  From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in     BC  Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another    years      Following the Battle of Carthage which began in     BC during the Third Punic War  Carthage was conquered by Rome in     BC      Following its conquest  the Romans renamed Carthage to Africa  incorporating it as a province    Ruins of Carthage During the Roman period  the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development  The economy  mainly during the Empire  boomed  the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture  Called the Granary of the Empire  the area of actual Tunisia and coastal Tripolitania  according to one estimate  produced one million tons of cereals each year  one quarter of which was exported to the Empire  Additional crops included beans  figs  grapes  and other fruits  By the  nd century  olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item  In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains  the principal production and exports included the textiles  marble  wine  timber  livestock  pottery such as African Red Slip  and wool    The Roman amphitheater in El Djem  built during the first half of the  rd century AD There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics  exported mainly to Italy  in the central area of El Djem  where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire   Berber bishop Donatus Magnus was the founder of a Christian group known as the Donatists      During the  th and  th centuries  from     to     AD   the Germanic Vandals invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present day Tripoli  The region was easily reconquered

 which ruled Tunisia  Tripolitania and eastern Algeria from     to          Tunisia flourished under Arab rule when extensive systems were constructed to supply towns with water for household use and irrigation that promoted agriculture  especially olive production           This prosperity permitted luxurious court life and was marked by the construction of new palace cities such as al Abassiya       and Raqadda            After conquering Cairo  the Fatimids abandoned Tunisia and parts of Eastern Algeria to the local Zirids                 Zirid Tunisia flourished in many areas  agriculture  industry  trade  and religious and secular learning      Management by the later Zirid emirs was neglectful though  and political instability was connected to the decline of Tunisian trade and agriculture              The depredation of the Tunisian campaigns by the Banu Hilal  a warlike Arab Bedouin tribe encouraged by the Fatimids of Egypt to seize Northwest Africa  sent the region s rural and urban economic life into further decline      Consequently  the region underwent rapid urbanisation as famines depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufactures      The Arab historian Ibn Khaldun wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert          The main Tunisian cities were conquered by the Normans of Sicily under the Kingdom of Africa in the   th century  but following the conquest of Tunisia in           by the Almohads the Normans were evacuated to Sicily  Communities of Tunisian Christians would still exist in Nefzaoua up to the   th century      The Almohads initially ruled over Tunisia through a governor  usually a near relative of the Caliph  Despite the prestige of the new masters  the country was still unruly  with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks  the latter being subjects of the Muslim Armenian adventurer Karakush  Also  Tunisia was occupied by Ayyubids between      and      and again between      and           The greatest threat to Almohad rule in Tunisia was the Banu Ghaniya  relatives of the Almoravids  who from their base in Mallorca tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb  Around      they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of Tunisia until they were crushed by Almohad troops in       After this success  the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of Tunisia  Tunisia remained part of the Almohad state  until      when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent  During the reign of the Hafsid dynasty  fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states      In the late   th century the coast became a pirate

Bey  Under its Turkish governors  the Beys  Tunisia attained virtual independence  The Hussein dynasty of Beys  established in       lasted until           This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers  During this era the governing councils controlling Tunisia remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the Turkish language  Attacks on European shipping were made by corsairs  primarily from Algiers  but also from Tunis and Tripoli  yet after a long period of declining raids the growing power of the
