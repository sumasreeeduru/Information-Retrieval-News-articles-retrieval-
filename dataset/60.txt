NairobiMetro  Kenya Census History edit  Main articles  History of Nairobi and Timeline of Nairobi Early years edit   Nairobi in      The site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp      The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning  cool waters   referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area      With the arrival of the Uganda Railway  the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot  shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway  Whitehouse  chief engineer of the railway  favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation  temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments          His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat  poorly drained and relatively infertile        Entrance to Nairobi railway station in      During the pre colonial era  the people of Kenya lived in villages amongst their tribes and cultures where they had rulers within their communities rather than a president and lived in that manner      In       Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot  It constituted two streets   Victoria Street and Station Street  ten avenues  staff quarters and an Indian commercial area      The railway arrived at Nairobi on    May       and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province          On the arrival of the railway  Whitehouse remarked that  Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels  shops and houses      The town s early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved      In the early     s  Bazaar Street  now Biashara Street  was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town      Between      and       the town s population rose from       to        and grew around administration and tourism  initially in the form of big game hunting      In       Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate      In       a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar  The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere      By the outset of the First World War  Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation      In       Nairobi was declared to be a municipality           Growth edit  In       Nairobi had        residents  of which        were native Africans      The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi  where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time      Due to this growth  the blend of the mixed ethnicities within the town s boundaries caused planning issues  Thorntorn White and his planning team would have described it as the  Nairobi Problem       In February       colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya  and said of the city   Maybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads  with avenues of flowering trees  flanked by noble buildings  with open spaces and stately squares  a cathedral worthy of faith and country  museums and of art  theatres and public offices  And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out  and much has already been done  But until that plan has borne fruit  Nairobi must remain what she was then  a slatternly creature  unfit to queen it over so lovely a country       The continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai  as the city was devouring their land to the south  It also angered the Kikuyu people  who wanted the land returned to them  After the end of World War II  this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion  Jomo Kenyatta  Kenya s future president  was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion  The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in       with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic   Post independence edit  After independence  Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city s infrastructure  Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence  though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check    Nairobi in      On    September       the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public  The    storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso  The construction was done in three phases  Phase I was the construction of the podium  Phase II consisted of the main tower  and Phase III involved the Plenary  Construction was completed in       with the opening ceremony occurring on    September and being presided over by Kenya s founding father President Kenyatta  It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public  Of the buildings built in the Seventies  the KICC was the most eco friendly and most environmentally conscious structure  its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel  sand  cement and wood  and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting  Cuboids made up the plenary hall  the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids  and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones  The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows  which allowed for maximum natural lighting  It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa      A years prior in       the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport  now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport   including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building  the airport s first dedicated cargo and freight terminal  new taxiways  associated aprons  internal roads  car parks  police and fire stations  a State Pavilion  airfield and roadway lighting  fire hydrant system  water  electrical  telecommunications and sewage systems  a dual carriageway passenger access road  security  drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport  Airport South Road   The total cost of the project was more than US    million  US       million in      dollars       On    March       construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport s single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death  The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its first president  The United States Embassy  then located in downtown Nairobi  was bombed in August      by Al Qaeda  as one of a series of US embassy bombings  It is now the site of a memorial park       Contemporary edit   Nairobi showing Fedha Towers  ICEA Building  the Nairobi Safari Club and Anniversary Towers  Woodvale Grove  Westlands On   November       President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES    billion Thika Superhighway  This mega project of Kenya started in      and ended in       It involved expanding the four lane carriageway to eight lanes  building underpasses  providing interchanges at roundabouts  erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion  The      kilometre road was built in three phases  Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout  Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and  Kenyatta University to Thika Town      On    May       the current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge Railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa  It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about     of total funding from China and about     from the Kenyan government  A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border   Historical population data for Nairobi edit    Year                                 Nairobi

undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network  The new systems of roads  flyovers  and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years  It is also a major component of Kenya s Vision      and Nairobi Metropolis plans  Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage    Eastern Bypass  Nairobi Private car population projection for Nairobi edit    YEAR                       Number of private cars                                      Water supply and sanitation edit  Further information  Water supply and sanitation in Nairobi     of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city  of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one  Water distribution losses   technically called non revenue water   are      and only     of those with house connections receive water continuously  Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence   Housing edit   Nairobi metro mapNairobi County  red Kajiado County  green  Machakos County  yellow  Kiambu County  purple   View of Kibera  the largest urban slum in Africa There is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi  Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi  but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income  Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just    of the city area      The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation  poor town planning  and the unavailability of loans for low income earners  citation needed  Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa      and is situated to the west of Nairobi   Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra  meaning  forest  or  jungle        The slums cover two square kilometres     and are on government land  Kibera has been the setting for several films  the most recent being The Constant Gardener  Other notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho  Altogether     areas are counted as slums within Nairobi      Many Nairobi non slum dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions  Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods  especially to the west of Nairobi  Historically  British occupiers have settled in Gigiri  Muthaiga  Langata and Karen  Other middle and high income estates include Parklands  Westlands  Hurlingham  Kilimani  Milimani  Spring Valley  Lavington  Rosslyn  Kitisuru  and Nairobi Hill  To accommodate the growing middle class  many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city  The most notable development is Greenpark  at Athi River  Machakos County    km     mi  from Nairobi s Central Business District  Over       houses  villas and apartments are being constructed at this development  including leisure  retail and commercial facilities      The development is being marketed to families  as are most others within the city  Eastlands also houses most of the city s middle class and includes South C  South B  Embakasi  Buru Buru  Komarock  Donholm  Umoja  and various others   Crime and law enforcement edit   Military helicopter over Westgate Shopping Mall Throughout the     s  Nairobi had struggled with rising crime  earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname  Nairobbery   a name which persists today       On   August       the US Embassy was bombed       killing     people and injuring       In       the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world  classifying the city as  status C   In the United Nations report  it was stated that in       nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city       The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies  burglaries  and carjackings       Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation  with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure  However  many claim      that the biggest factor for the city s alarming crime rate is police corruption  which leaves many criminals unpunished  As a security precaution  most large houses have a watch guard  burglar grills  and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night       Most crimes  however  occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours       In       crime decreased in the city       due to increased security and an improved police presence  Despite this  in       the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years       Since then  the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country  Following a grenade attack in October      by a local Kenyan man  with terrorist links       the city faced a heightened security presence       Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya s involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit       There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on    March       where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue collar bar in Nairobi  killing nine and injuring more than     On    May          people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi  near Moi avenue       On    September       Al Shabaab associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall     people were killed       On January           five gunmen attacked the DusitD  hotel in Nairobi s Westlands neighborhood       The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby  and was followed by gunfire  Terror group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed    people  The attack was unexpected  because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area  Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa s economic hub   Media edit   Nation Centre  headquarters of the Nation Media Group Nairobi is home to most of Kenya s news and media organisations  The city is also home to the region s largest newspapers  the Daily Nation and The Standard  These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues  Both newspapers are published in English  Kenya Broadcasting Corporation  a state run television and radio station  is headquartered in the city  Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya s first privately owned TV station  The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi  There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya s capital including KISS      Capital FM  East FM  Kameme FM  Metro FM  and Family FM  among others  Several multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi  These include the BBC  CNN  Agence France Presse  Reuters  Deutsche Welle  and the Associated Press  The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi s city centre  while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri  The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi        The
