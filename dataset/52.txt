failed verification  Fact checking can be conducted before  ante hoc  or after  post hoc  the text is published or otherwise disseminated     Internal fact checking is such checking done in house by the publisher  when the text is analyzed by a third party  the process is called external fact checking     Ante hoc fact checking aims to identify errors so that the text can be corrected before dissemination  or perhaps rejected  Post hoc fact checking is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies  sometimes with a visual metric provided by the checking organization  e g   Pinocchios from The Washington Post Fact Checker  or TRUTH O METER ratings from PolitiFact   Several organizations are devoted to post hoc fact checking  examples include FactCheck org and PolitiFact in the US  and Full Fact in the UK  External post hoc fact checking organizations first arose in the US in the early     s     and the concept grew in relevance and spread to various other countries during the     s     The US remains the largest market for fact checking     Research on the impact of fact checking is relatively recent  but the existing research suggests that fact checking does indeed correct perceptions among citizens     as well as discourage politicians from spreading false or misleading claims      Contents    Post hoc fact checking      Consistency across fact checkers

fact checking by independent organizations began in the United States in the early     s     In the     s  particularly following the      election of Donald Trump as US President  fact checking gained a rise in popularity and spread to multiple countries mostly in Europe and Latin America  However  the US remains the largest market for fact checking      Consistency across fact checkers edit  One study finds that fact checkers PolitiFact  FactCheck org  and Washington Post s Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims        However  a study by Morgan Marietta  David C  Barker and Todd Bowser found  substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered   They concluded that this limited the  usefulness of fact checking for citizens trying to decide which version of disputed realities to believe      A paper by Chloe Lim  PhD student at Stanford University  found little overlap in the statements that fact checkers check  Out of       fact checks by PolitiFact and     fact checks by The Washington Post s Fact Checker  there were only    statements that both fact checkers checked  The study found that the fact checkers gave consistent ratings for    out of    statements  which means that one out every five times  the two fact checkers disagree on the accuracy of statements      The process of fact checking is sometimes questionable  partly because the fact checkers are just human subjects  and also because the purpose of some instances of fact checking was unclear           Effects edit  Studies of post hoc fact checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior  in general  of both the speaker  making them more careful in their pronouncements  and of the listener or reader  making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content   observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unswayed by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects  or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting  e g    attack ads    and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like minded to begin with       Correcting misperceptions edit  A      study found evidence of a  backfire effect   correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views    Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give patients the flu as well as concerns about its safety  However  the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects a response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern       A      study attempted to replicate the findings of the      study but failed to do so      A      study found little evidence for the  backfire effect    By and large  citizens heed factual information  even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments       A study of Donald Trump supporters during the      race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect   When respondents read a news article about Mr  Trump s speech that included F B I  statistics indicating that crime had  fallen dramatically and consistently over time   their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information  though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority            A      study found no evidence of a backfire effect      Studies have shown that fact checking can affect citizens  belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement      A      study by Paris School of Economics and Sciences Po economists found that falsehoods by Marine Le Pen during the      French presidential election campaign  i  successfully persuaded voters   ii  lost their persuasiveness when fact checked  and  iii  did not reduce voters  political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact checked      A      study in the Journal of Politics found that  individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction  even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations  though they do so cautiously and with some bias    Interestingly  those who identify with one of the political parties are no more biased or cautious than pure independents in their learning  conditional on initial beliefs       A study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and David G  Rand found that Facebook tags of fake articles  did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags  but only modestly       A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found          A  disputed  tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from     to      whereas a  rated false  tag pushed the number down to          A      study found that the  disputed  tag reduced Facebook users  intentions to share a fake news story      The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than    years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate      In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook  disputed  tags  Facebook decided to drop the tags in December      and would instead put articles which fact checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook      Based on the findings of a      study in the journal Psychological Science  the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by       limiting detailed descriptions of   or arguments in favor of the misinformation  walking through the reasons why a piece of misinformation is false rather than just labelling it false  presenting new and credible information which allows readers to update their knowledge of events and understand why they developed an inaccurate understanding in the first place  using video  as videos appear to be more effective than text at increasing attention and reducing confusion  making videos more effective at correcting misperception than text  A      meta analysis of research into the effects of fact checking on misinformation found that fact checking has substantial positive impacts on political beliefs  but that this impact weakened when fact checkers used  truth scales   refuted only parts of a claim and when they fact checked campaign related statements  Individuals  preexisting beliefs  ideology  and knowledge affected to what extent the fact checking had an impact      A      study in the Journal of Experimental Political Science found  strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news  regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories       A paper by Andrew Guess  of Princeton University   Brendan Nyhan  Dartmouth College  and Jason Reifler  University of Exeter  found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact checking  in particular Trump supporters      The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact checks   only about half of the Americans who visited a fake news website during the study period also saw any fact check from one of the dedicated fact checking website               A      study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact      A      study found that exposure to fact checks had durable effects on reducing misperceptions       Political discourse edit  A      experimental study found that fact checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation  The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites  The researchers sent   a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements  The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly  suggesting that fact checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat       Political preferences edit  One experimental study found that fact checking during debates affected viewers  assessment of the candidates  debate performance and  greater willingness to vote for a candidate when the fact check indicates that the candidate is being honest       A study of Trump supporters during the      presidential campaign found that while fact checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters  belief in the false claims in question  the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump      A      study found that  summary fact checking   where the fact checker summarizes how many false statements a politician has made  has a greater impact on reducing support for a politician than fact checking of individual statements made by the politician       Criticism and controversies edit  Political fact checking is sometimes criticized as being opinion journalism          Criticism has included that fact checking organizations in themselves are biased or that it is impossible to apply absolute terms such as  true  or  false  to inherently debatable claims      In September       a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that  just     of all Likely U S  Voters trust media fact checking of candidates  comments  Sixty two percent       believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support           Deceptive websites that pose as fact checkers have also been used to promote disinformation  This tactic has been used by both Russia and Turkey       Informal fact checking edit  Individual readers perform some types of fact checking  such as comparing claims in one news story against claims in another  Rabbi Moshe Benovitz  has observed that   modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma   He says this has positive implications for values development    Fact checking can become a learned skill  and technology can be harnessed in a way that makes it second nature  By finding opportunities to integrate technology into learning  students will automatically sense the beautiful blending of  their cyber   and non virtual worlds   Instead of two spheres coexisting uneasily and warily orbiting one another  there is a valuable experience of synthesis        Detecting fake news edit  Main article  Fake news Fake news has become increasingly prevalent over the last few years  with the      election revealing that online media platforms were especially susceptible to disseminating disinformation and misinformation     Fake news articles tend to come from satirical news websites or individual websites with an incentive to propagate false information  either as clickbait or to serve a purpose      Since these articles typically hope to intentionally promote biased or incorrect information  these articles are difficult to detect  When identifying a source of information  one must look at many attributes  including but not limited to the content of the email and social media engagements  The language  specifically  is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles  in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks  Furthermore  modeling techniques such as n gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to determine the legitimacy of a news course  On top of that  researchers have determined that visual based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article  specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate  and provides us more clarity on the news      There is also many social context features that can play a role  as well as the model of spreading the news  Websites such as  Snopes  try to detect this information manually  while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves     For a more comprehensive list  see List of fact checking websites  Main category  Fact checking websites Some individuals and organizations publish their fact checking efforts on the internet  These may have a special subject matter focus  such as Snopes com s focus on urban legends or the Reporters  Lab at Duke University s focus on providing resources to journalists   Fake News and Social Media edit  The adaptation of social media as a legitimate and commonly used platform has created extensive concerns for fake news in this domain  The spread of fake news via social media platforms such as Facebook  Twitter and Instagram presents the opportunity for extremely negative effects on society therefore new fields of research regarding fake news detection on social media is gaining momentum  However  fake news detection on social media presents challenges that renders previous data mining and detection techniques inadequate      As such  researchers are calling for more work to be done regarding fake news as characterized against psychology and social theories and adapting existing data mining algorithms to apply to social media networks       Further  multiple scientific articles have been published urging the field further to find automatic ways in which fake news can be filtered out of social media timelines    Ongoing research in fact checking and detecting fake news edit   Donald Trump  a prominent figure in regards to fake news Since the      United States presidential election  fake news has been a popular topic of discussion by President Trump and news outlets  The reality of fake news had become omnipresent  and a lot of research has gone into understanding  identifying  and combating fake news  Also  a number of researchers began with the usage of fake news to influence the      presidential campaign  One research found evidence of pro Trump fake news being selectively targeted on conservatives and pro Trump supporters in           The researchers found that social media sites  Facebook in particular  to be powerful platforms to spread certain fake news to targeted groups to appeal to their sentiments during the      presidential race  Additionally  researchers from Stanford  NYU  and NBER found evidence to show how engagement with fake news on Facebook and Twitter was high throughout           Recently  a lot of work has gone into detecting and identifying fake news through machine learning and artificial intelligence  In       researchers at MIT s CSAIL  Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab  created and tested a machine learning algorithm to identify false information by looking for common patterns  words  and symbols that typically appear in fake news      More so  they released an open source data set with a large catalog of historical news sources with their veracity scores to encourage other researchers to explore and develop new methods and technologies for detecting fake news  citation needed   International Fact Checking Day edit  The concept for International Fact Checking Day was introduced at a conference for journalists and fact checkers at the London School of Economics in June            The holiday was officially created in      and first celebrated on April               The idea for International Fact Checking day rose out of the many misinformation campaigns found on the internet  particularly social media sites  It rose in importance after the      elections  which brought fake news  as well as accusations of it  to the forefront of media issues   The holiday is held on April   because  April   is a day for fools  April   is a day for facts        Activities for International Fact Checking Day consist of various media organizations contributing to fact checking resources  articles  and lessons for students and the general public to learn more about how to identify fake news and stop the spread of misinformation        s International Fact Checking Day focused specifically on how to accurately identify information about COVID      Ante hoc fact checking edit  Among the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious  sometimes costly  problems  These problems can include lawsuits for mistakes that damage people or businesses  but even small mistakes can cause a loss of reputation for the publication  The loss of reputation is often the more significant motivating factor for journalists      Fact checkers verify that the names  dates  and facts in an article or book are correct      For example  they may contact a person who is quoted in a proposed news article and ask the person whether this quotation is correct  or how to spell the person s name  Fact checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes  they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit journalistic frauds   As a career edit  Professional fact checkers have generally been hired by newspapers  magazines  and book publishers  probably starting in the early     s with the creation of Time magazine in the United States         though they were not originally called  fact checkers       Fact checkers may be aspiring writers  future editors  or freelancers engaged other projects  others are career professionals      Historically  the field was considered women s work  and from the time of the first professional American fact checker through at least the     s  the fact checkers at a media company might be entirely female or primarily so      The number of people employed in fact checking varies by publication  Some organizations have substantial fact checking departments  For example  The New Yorker magazine had    fact checkers in           Others may hire freelancers per piece  or may combine fact checking with other duties  Magazines are more likely to use fact checkers than newspapers     Television and radio programs rarely employ dedicated fact checkers  and instead expect others  including senior staff  to engage in fact checking in addition to their other duties       Checking original reportage edit  Stephen Glass began his journalism career as a fact checker  He went on to invent fictitious stories  which he submitted as reportage  and which fact checkers at The New Republic  and other weeklies for which he worked  never flagged  Michael Kelly  who edited some of Glass s concocted stories  blamed himself  rather than the fact checkers  saying   Any fact checking system is built on trust     If a reporter is willing to fake notes  it defeats the system  Anyway  the real vetting system is not fact checking but the editor        Education on fact checking edit  With the circulation of fake news on the internet  many organizations have dedicated time to create guidelines to help read to verify the information they are consuming  Many universities across America provide university students resources and tools to help them verify their sources  Universities provide access to research guides that help students conduct thorough research with reputable sources within academia  Organizations like FactCheck org  OntheMedia org  and PolitiFact com provide procedural guidelines that help individuals navigate the process to fact check a source  citation needed  MIT and Stanford began an online MOOC course in the fall of      called Sorting Truth From Fiction  Civic Online Reasoning      This course is for educators that want to teach students how to do basic fact checking   Books on professional fact checking edit  Sarah Harrison Smith spent some time and also headed the fact checking department for The New York Times  She is the author of the book  The Fact Checker s Bible  Jim Fingal worked for several years as a fact checker at The Believer and McSweeney s and is co author with John D Agata of The Lifespan of a Fact which is an inside look at the struggle between fact checker  Fingal  and author  D Agata  over an essay that pushed the limits of the acceptable  artistic license  for a non fiction work  Alumni of the role edit  The following is a list of individuals for whom it has been reported  reliably  that they have
