             also known in the Muslim world as the Gaza Massacre                           and referred to as the Battle of al Furqan                  by Hamas          was a three week armed conflict between Gaza Strip Palestinian paramilitary groups and the Israel Defense Forces  IDF  that began on    December      and ended on    January      with a unilateral ceasefire  The conflict resulted in between       and       Palestinian and    Israeli deaths    from friendly fire       The Israeli government s stated goal was to stop indiscriminate Palestinian rocket fire into Israel     and weapons smuggling into the Gaza strip              Hamas stated its rocket fire  which resumed in November       was in response to an Israeli raid of a tunnel leading from Gaza  which it characterized as a ceasefire violation          Israel said the raid was a preemptive strike against a tunnel they believed would be used to abduct Israeli soldiers guarding the border          In the initial air assault  Israeli forces attacked police stations  military targets including weapons caches and suspected rocket firing teams  as well as political and administrative institutions in the opening assault  striking in the densely populated cities of Gaza  Khan Yunis and Rafah      After hostilities broke out  Palestinian groups fired rockets in response to what they characterized as  massacres       The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets as illegal under international law              An Israeli ground invasion began on   January  On   January  the IDF began operating in the densely populated urban centers of Gaza  During the last week of the offensive  from    January   Israel mostly hit targets it had damaged before and struck Palestinian rocket launching units      Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against mostly civilian targets in southern Israel  reaching the major cities of Beersheba and Ashdod for the first time during the conflict              Israeli politicians ultimately decided against striking deeper within Gaza amid concerns of higher casualties on both sides and rising international criticism  citation needed  The conflict ended on    January  when the IDF first declared a unilateral ceasefire  followed by Hamas  announcing a one week ceasefire twelve hours later        The IDF completed its withdrawal on    January      According to the Shin Bet  after the conflict  there was a decrease in Palestinian rocket attacks      In September       a UN special mission  headed by the South African Justice Richard Goldstone  produced a report accusing both Palestinian militants and the IDF of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity  and recommended bringing those responsible to justice      In January       the Israeli government released a response criticizing the Goldstone Report and disputing its findings      In       Goldstone wrote that he no longer believed that Israel intentionally targeted civilians in Gaza      The other authors of the report  Hina Jilani  Christine Chinkin  and Desmond Travers  rejected Goldstone s re assessment          The United Nations Human Rights Council ordered Israel to conduct various repairs of the damages  On    September       the United Nations Human Rights Council concluded that     of civilian homes destroyed in the attack were not rebuilt       Contents    Background           six month ceasefire        Implementation

Timeline of the Gaza War  List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel        and List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel       The Gaza Strip is a coastal strip of land on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea bordering Egypt and Israel  Following the death of Yassar Arafat in November       his successor to the Palestinian Authority  President Mahmoud Abbas  and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon signed a ceasefire agreement on   February       essentially bringing an end to the Second Intifada      On    March      the    main Palestinian factions including Hamas and Islamic Jihad agreed to be bound by the February agreement  conditional on cessation of Israeli attacks      Israel maintains that its occupation of Gaza ended following the completion of its unilateral disengagement plan in September               Because in the post disengagement period  after       Israel has continued to control and occupy Gaza s airspace and territorial waters  and continues to restrict or prohibit the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza         and to unilaterally dictate what Gazans may do in a border strip of variable and undefined width in their own territory          the UN  the International Criminal Court     Human Rights Watch      and many other NGOs consider Israel still to be the occupying power              Hamas refrained from firing rockets toward Israel for    months in accordance with the February ceasefire agreement  until IDF naval shelling hit a Gaza beach  killing seven civilians  on    June           Israel and the Quartet failed to anticipate Hamas s electoral victory in the January      legislative elections  which the U S  had pushed for  The victory permitted the formation of a Hamas led Palestinian Authority government in March       The Quartet  the United States  Russia  United Nations  and European Union  conditioned future foreign assistance to the Hamas led PA on the future government s commitment to nonviolence  recognition of the state of Israel  and acceptance of previous agreements      Hamas rejected the demands  calling the conditions unfair and endangering the well being of Palestinians      leading to Quartet suspension of its foreign assistance program and to Israel imposing economic sanctions      In a widely cited article                  David Rose outlined material suggesting that the United States and Israel then attempted to have the Palestinian National Authority stage a coup to overturn the election results  a manoeuvre Hamas is said to have preempted in Gaza with its takeover from Fatah              In June       following Hamas s takeover of Gaza from Fatah  Israel imposed a ground  air  and maritime blockade  and announced it would allow only humanitarian supplies into the Strip          Palestinian groups were partially able to bypass the blockade through tunnels  some of which are said to have been used for weapons smuggling      According to a US diplomatic cable that quoted Israeli diplomats  Israel s policy was to  keep Gaza s economy on the brink of collapse           After a three and a half year legal battle waged by the Gisha human rights organization  the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories  COGAT  finally released a      document that detailed its  red lines  for  food consumption in the Gaza Strip   in which a calculation was made of the number of calories needed to be provided to Gaza by external sources to avoid malnutrition  COGAT said that the document was a draft  and never discussed nor implemented  An Israeli appeal court disagreed                  Between      and       Palestinian groups in Gaza fired about       locally made Qassam rockets into Israel  killing four Israeli civilians and injuring    others  During the same period  Israel fired more than            mm artillery shells into the Gaza Strip  killing    Palestinians and injuring      According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  between      and           Israelis  including civilians and Israeli security forces  which includes Israeli police  Israeli Border Police and members of the armed services  were killed in both Israel and the Palestinian Territories in  direct conflict related incidents  and       were injured      During this time        Palestinians  including civilians and militants from various groups  were killed and       wounded in  direct conflict related incidents             six month ceasefire Main article       Israel Hamas ceasefire  Palestinians killed by the IDF in Gaza  red  and Israelis killed by Palestinians in Israel  blue  during January December      according to B Tselem  Rocket hits in Israel  January December          Israel had been preparing to intervene militarily in the Gaza Strip since March           In June as talks for a negotiated agreement between the two parties were underway  the defense minister Ehud Barak ordered the IDF to prepare operational plans for action within the Strip       On    June       an Egyptian brokered six month  lull  or pause in hostilities between Israel and Hamas went into effect       The agreement had no mutually agreed text or enforcement mechanism and eventually collapsed       The lull agreed to was thought necessary to allow time for the IDF to prepare its operation            The agreement required Hamas to end rocket and mortar attacks on Israel  while that country would cease attacks on and military incursions into Gaza  plus progressively ease the blockade of Gaza over a thirteen day period       Points on which there was not mutual agreement included an end to Hamas  military buildup in Gaza and movement toward the release of Corporal Shalit            Hamas called on all of Gaza s militant groups to abide by the truce  and was confident they would do so                      Defense Ministry Official Amos Gilad  the Israeli envoy to the talks  stressed that Israel demanded a ceasefire  meaning that even one single rocket fired will be seen as a violation of the agreement  He added that Egypt  on its side  was committed to preventing the smuggling activity from Gaza       Gilad also said that Israel would hold Hamas responsible for attacks from Gaza       In a British Foreign Affairs Committee investigation  Dr Albasoos said that  Unfortunately  on   November       the Israeli army killed six Palestinians  I was leaving the Gaza Strip to come to the UK that same night  I remember when the Israeli army invaded the middle area of the Gaza Strip  killing six Palestinians  It was outrageous from their side to come and breach that ceasefire  I believe that Palestinian political factions  including Hamas  committed to that ceasefire and still have the intention to renew it in the near future  as soon as possible   In rebuttal  Ms Bar Yaacov said that  The Israelis had added a condition to the tahdia  truce   being concerned that Hamas was building tunnels to go under the Israeli border and kidnap more Israeli soldiers  The condition stated that if Hamas came within     metres of the border  they  the IDF  would attack and that is exactly what happened  on   November              British barrister and professor Geoffrey Nice  and General Nick Parker  opined during a lecture that  Building a tunnel was not a breach of the ceasefire but the armed incursion into Gaza definitely was          Implementation Pre   November        The ceasefire has brought enormous improvements in the quality of life in Sderot and other Israeli villages near Gaza  where before the ceasefire residents lived in fear of the next Palestinian rocket strike  However  nearby in the Gaza Strip  the Israeli blockade remains in place and the population has so far seen few dividends from the ceasefire        Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire            Despite Israel s refusal to comply significantly with the truce agreement to end the siege blockade  Hamas brought rocket and mortar fire from Gaza to a virtual halt during the summer and fall of            Hamas  tried to enforce the terms of the arrangement  on other Palestinian groups  taking  a number of steps against networks which violated the arrangement   including short term detention and confiscating their weapons  but it could not completely end the rocket and mortar shell attacks by these rogue factions in Gaza  Hamas had sought support in Gazan public opinion for its policy of maintaining the ceasefire       On   August there were massive clashes in Gaza City after Hamas had stepped up its campaign to curb Fatah from attacking Israel      The truce started uneasily with the UN recording seven IDF violations of the ceasefire between    and    June  On various occasions Israeli forces shot at farmers  wood collectors and fishermen in Gaza territory  seriously injuring two farmers  Subsequently  between    and    June  nine Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in three separate violations by Palestinian groups not affiliated with Hamas  No Israelis were injured                      Islamic Jihad reportedly fired the rockets in retaliation for Israeli assassinations of their members in the West Bank  According to sources close to the ceasefire negotiations  after    hours from the start of the ceasefire  the crossing points would be opened to allow    per cent more goods to enter the Gaza strip  Ten days after that  i e  thirteen days after the ceasefire began   all crossings would be open between Gaza and Israel  and Israel will allow the transfer of all goods that were banned or restricted to go into Gaza       Therefore  besides firing on and killing Gaza citizens  Israel failed further to comply with these truce obligations to ease the blockade that were crucial to all groups in Gaza  Islamic Jihad put pressure on Hamas to press Israel to comply with this vital part of the truce       The Carter Center recorded  based on U N  OCHAO data  that instead of easing the blockade according to the agreed schedule       despite the     drop in attacks  the truce did not do much to ease the siege of Gaza  Imports increased only marginally     only     of the amount of goods entering in January       were allowed through at best  No exports were allowed  After the June      ceasefire  the number of Palestinians entering and exiting Gaza at the Rafah crossing with Egypt increased slightly  with     people leaving in August       but this number decreased soon after to only one in October       The passage of Gazans through the Erez crossing reveal similar low numbers       Historian Ian Bickerton argues that Israel s failure to comply with the terms of the truce made conditions harder in Gaza       Even though not part of the generally accepted truce terms       by    June      Hamas and Israel began talks  via an Egyptian intermediary  regarding the release of the captured IDF soldier  Shalit        As of    August  the UN reported that Israel was allowing a few new items into Gaza  including limited supplies of cement  clothes  juices  and agricultural materials  but said that overall humanitarian conditions had not significantly improved since the cease fire began   After a few weeks of calm  clashes resumed  On    September the IDF shot and seriously wounded an unarmed Palestinian who strayed close to the border  A retaliatory rocket was fired  On    September IDF troops entered central Gaza to bulldoze land along the border fence  On    September  the UN reported   Although the cease fire has afforded the populations in southern Israel and Gaza greater security  there has been no corresponding improvement in living conditions for the population in Gaza       After the initial increase of goods allowed into Gaza to     of the      levels  OCHAO data shows that the through flow then fell rapidly through the September October lull in rocket fire to below even pre June levels            Notwithstanding Hamas not having fired a single rocket during the truce prior to   November            Israel accused Hamas of bad faith and of violations of the Egyptian mediated truce  Even though neither was included as Hamas obligations under the generally accepted terms of this truce       Israel noted that rocket fire from Gaza never stopped entirely   between June    and November       rockets       and    mortar shells      were fired at Israel   and that weapons smuggling was not halted       Hamas  in turn  accused Israel of non compliance with the truce by never allowing the major renewal of goods  flow into Gaza and of conducting raids that killed Hamas fighters            During October      Israel Palestinian violence fell to its lowest level since the start of the al Aqsa intifada in September            One rocket and   mortar shell were fired at Israel in October       However  during the same period several Israeli violations were reported  In South Gaza on   October the IDF fired on two unarmed Palestinians near the border and sent soldiers into the strip to arrest them and detain them in Israel  On    October IDF bulldozers entered Gaza  On    October IDF soldiers fired into Gaza for unknown reasons damaging a school in Khuza a and injuring one child  Palestinian fishing boats off the Gaza coast were fired upon on four separate occasions during the month wounding two fishermen  one of them seriously       According to Mondoweiss  for the entire duration of the      Hamas Israel cease fire   even after the Israeli raid of a Hamas tunnel on   November   not a single person was killed by rocket or mortar fire into Israel        Pre operation actions Further information  Violence in the Israeli Palestinian conflict        November IDF cross border raid On   November       Israel launched a cross border military raid  variously also referred to as an attack   invasion   incident   military event   incursion  code named Operation Double Challenge into a residential area of Dayr al Balah in central Gaza to destroy the opening of a cross border      tunnel concealed within a building     meters from the fence on the Gaza Strip border       Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice QC and General Sir Nick Parker observed that  Building a tunnel was not a breach of the ceasefire but the  IDF  armed incursion into Gaza definitely was             Various outlets and authors reported this Israeli action as breaking the June truce                 According to the Telegraph  writing as Cast Lead began  the   November operation  sealed the fate of the ceasefire        Author Avi Shlaim wrote in      that the     ceasefire had a dramatic effect in de escalating the conflict     It was Israel that violated the ceasefire  On   November       the  IDF  launched a raid into Gaza and killed   Hamas fighters  That was the end of the ceasefire   and that Hamas had set a  good example  in respecting the ceasefire       The raid  according to Mark LeVine was unprovoked       Israel stated its aim was to destroy what it said was a tunnel on the Gaza Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers  While accusing Hamas of plotting to dig a tunnel under the border  Israeli defense official was quoted in The Washington Times as separately acknowledging that Israel wanted to  send Hamas a message        According to Israel  the raid was not a violation of the ceasefire  but a legitimate step to remove an immediate threat  The      Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict noted that  the ceasefire began to founder on   November      following an incursion by Israeli soldiers into the Gaza Strip          Tunnel threat Dr  Eado Heart  an Israeli defence analyst specialising in underground warfare  defined three types of Gaza tunnels  namely those intended for  smuggling  from Egypt  those which are  defensive  in nature designed for storage and protection  and those that are  offensive  permitting cross border penetrations into Israel by Gaza militants   Once you find the entrance  you have to climb inside to know whether it is a defensive or offensive tunnel        Defensive tunnels have served as an  escape hatch  for senior Hamas officials during Israeli invasions        The purpose of the defensive tunnels is to enable the Hamas command structure to reside safely underground while their armed forces conduct a mobile defence against Israeli forces       Robert Pastor  who was intimately involved in the indirect      Hamas Israel negotiations  stated  There is some dispute as to whether that tunnel was intended to capture an Israeli soldier or whether it was a defensive tunnel to protect against an Israeli incursion       Later  once a new ceasefire had been negotiated  Pastor was quoted as saying that  Hamas officials asserted  however  that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes  not to capture IDF personnel  and furthermore that an IDF official had confirmed that fact to him       The IDF allegation that the  tunnel  attacked by it on   November      was  offensive   aimed at abducting IDF soldiers and posing an imminent threat  was also reported with doubt by various other players and commentators  such as UNISPAL that wrote  IDF special forces had entered the area to blow up a tunnel dug by Hamas for allegedly kidnapping IDF soldiers        Another example is the Israeli daily Ha aretz that wrote   The tunnel was  dug ostensibly to facilitate the abduction of Israeli soldiers   but the tunnel  was not a clear and present danger         Former U S  President Jimmy Carter wrote   Israel launched an attack in Gaza to destroy a defensive tunnel being dug by Hamas inside the wall that encloses Gaza        The Journal of Palestine Studies favourably referenced Norman Finkelstein   Israel broke the cease fire by killing seven Palestinian militants  on the flimsy excuse that Hamas was digging a tunnel to abduct Israeli soldiers  and knowing full well that its operation would provoke Hamas into hitting back        Noam Chomsky observed   The pretext for the raid was that Israel had detected a tunnel in Gaza that might have been intended for use to capture another Israeli soldier  a  ticking tunnel  in official communiques  The pretext was transparently absurd  as a number of commentators noted  If such a tunnel existed  and reached the border  Israel could easily have barred it right there         Raid A paratroopers reconnaissance battalion commanded by Yaron Finkelman  supported by tanks and bulldozers crossed the border and penetrated about     meters into the Gaza Strip to destroy the tunnel       A firefight broke out  in which one Hamas fighter was killed  Hamas responded with a barrage of mortar and rocket fire at Israeli troops  Three Israeli airstrikes on Hamas mortar and rocket positions then killed five Hamas fighters  According to eyewitnesses  another three Hamas fighters were wounded in an Israeli UCAV strike over the el Burejj refugee camp       Three Israeli soldiers were also wounded during the operation  Hamas said it would take revenge for what it perceived as an act of Israeli aggression that had violated the truce            Hamas launched    rockets into southern Israel in what was described by Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum as a  response to Israel s massive breach of the truce   stating that  The Israelis began this tension and they must pay an expensive price  They cannot leave us drowning in blood while they sleep soundly in their beds             The blockade of Gaza was tightened further the following day        Immediate repercussions The intensity of rocket attacks targeted at Israeli cities near Gaza sharply increased after the   November      cross border IDF attack  approaching pre truce levels  Clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants also took place along the border  during which    Palestinian militants were killed       According to CAMERA  in the period between   November incident and mid December  more than     Qassam rockets and mortar shells landed in the western Negev region  most fired immediately after the   November tunnel raid by the IDF  and thereafter decreasing to a  few per day        Israel had frequently shut down the crossings in response to rocket attacks on its towns        December repercussions On    December  Israel announced that it favored extending the cease fire  provided Hamas adhered to the conditions       On    December  a Hamas delegation in Cairo proposed that Hamas was prepared to stop all rocket attacks against Israel if the Israelis would open up the Gaza border crossings and pledge not to launch attacks in Gaza       as per the original June      truce terms  to that date not complied with by Israel       On the same day  Hamas officials said that earlier reports  quoting Khaled Meshaal as saying there would be no renewal of the truce  were inaccurate  A Hamas spokesman said that the lull would not be renewed   as long as there is no real Israeli commitment to all of its conditions        A spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister replied that Israel was committed to the truce but  it s clear there can t be a one sided ceasefire      where rockets are everyday coming from the Gaza Strip targeting Israeli civilians        On    December  a    year old Palestinian was killed by IDF fire in Northern Gaza       The following day     December  Hamas declared the end of the cease fire  a day before the truce officially expired       More than    rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel on that day       On    December  Hamas refused to enter talks to renew the six month truce and a Hamas spokesman announced that it would not extend the cease fire            The spokesman  Ayman Taha  specified that Hamas s refusal was  because the enemy did not abide by its obligations  to ease a crippling blockade of the Gaza Strip  and had not halted all attacks       Palestinian sources said that Hamas wanted to renew the truce  but only on improved terms   a complete opening of the border crossings with Israel  the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt  a complete ban on Israeli military activity in Gaza and an extension of the truce to the West Bank as well  Israel was not ready to accept these terms       This was confirmed by Yuval Diskin  head of Shin Bet  Israel s internal security agency   at an Israeli cabinet meeting on    December  Diskin said he thought Hamas was  interested in continuing the truce  but wants to improve its terms     it wants us to lift the siege of Gaza  stop attacks  and extend the truce to include the West Bank        Three Qassam rockets fired from the northern Gaza Strip landed in Israel       On    December  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that his country will not accept the ongoing rocket fire from the Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip  Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni  who had supported the truce until recently  suggested that military actions be taken against the Hamas government in Gaza       On    December  senior Hamas leader Mahmoud al Zahar said that Hamas was willing to renew the cease fire under the original terms  demanding an Israeli commitment to refrain from any military operation in the Strip and to keep the border crossings open  Speaking with Egyptian newspaper al Ahram  al Zahar said that the movement would reassess the situation in Gaza once the    hours during which Hamas vowed to halt rocket fire had ended       Despite the temporary ceasefire declared by the armed Palestinian factions  eight Qassam rockets and eight mortar shells hit the Negev            Also that day  Israeli Defense Forces killed three Palestinian militants  stating they were planting explosives on the border       On    December  an Israeli airstrike hit a group of militants in the Gaza Strip  An Israeli military spokesman said that the militants had fired mortars at Israel  Palestinian medics said that one Hamas militant was killed in the strike and two other Palestinians were wounded  including a cameraman from Hamas  television station       On that day  Hamas military wing issued a statement saying that it began an operation code named  Operation Oil Stain      Palestinian mortar shells  Katyusha and Qassam rockets hit the Negev            Hamas said that it would expand the  Oil Stain  and put thousands of Israelis  under fire   Hamas said it was ready for the war   far greater than surrendering to Israeli threats and that they became much more prepared to counter Israeli aggression and to defend themselves than in the past        On    December  after Israel had  wrapped up preparations for a broad offensive   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert delivered a final warning in an interview with the Arabic language satellite channel al Arabiya  He said  I am telling them now  it may be the last minute  I m telling them stop it  We are stronger        Another   Qassams landed in southern Israel         Proceeding Main article  Timeline of the Gaza War See also  Incidents in the Gaza War Israeli offensive Israel began planning for a military operation as early as six months before the conflict by collecting intelligence on potential targets  The IDF also engaged in a disinformation campaign to give Hamas a false sense of security and to take them by surprise  Defense minister Ehud Barak stated that the offensive was the result of Israel s  patience running out  over the rocket attacks            which had been restarted by Hamas after Israel destroyed a tunnel on   November            According to Israeli officials  its subsequent    December offensive took Hamas by surprise  thereby increasing militant casualties        Air strikes  Israeli F   I of the    th Squadron preparing for takeoff At       am on    December       Israel launched the campaign titled Operation Cast Lead  It began with an opening wave of airstrikes in which F    fighter jets and AH    Apache attack helicopters      simultaneously struck     preplanned targets within a span of     seconds  There was a     success rate with zero misses in the opening attack according to the Israeli Air Force       Thirty minutes later  a second wave of    jets and helicopters struck at an additional    targets  The air strikes hit Hamas headquarters  government offices and    police stations           An Israeli UAV airstrike on the police headquarters of Gaza City killed    people  including several dozen police cadets at their graduation ceremony       Approximately     members of Hamas were killed  including Tawfik Jaber  head of Hamas  police force            Another estimate puts the death toll of the police academy strike at     Hamas militants killed and     injured       Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni told reporters that Israel would strike all targets associated with what she called the  illegitimate  terrorist government of Hamas        At least         Palestinians were killed and more than     injured on the first day of air strikes  Civilians  including children  were among the casualties       Although media reported that most of the dead were  Hamas security forces  or  Hamas operatives             police officers are  according to B Tselem  presumed to be civilians and likely not legitimate objects of attack under international humanitarian law       Human rights groups critically note that the attacks began around the time children were leaving school       The Israeli attack was the deadliest one day death toll in    years of conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians  a day that was called the  Massacre of Black Saturday  by Palestinians in Gaza            Hamas responded with a rocket barrage on Southern Israel  and Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip kept Southern Israel under constant rocket fire during the entire war  Beersheba suffered two rocket attacks  the farthest Palestinian rockets had ever reached  Palestinian rocket fire killed three Israeli civilians and one soldier in the early days of the conflict       In the weeks following the initial air raids F   Is and AH    Apaches continued to target Hamas facilities while also inflicting severe damage to Palestinian infrastructure       Israel used the      pound Mark    Joint Direct Attack Munition to attack buildings and tunnels along the Gaza Sinai border  The     pound variant was used against underground bunkers       Israel also used the new PB   A  laser guided hard target penetration bomb  which was developed by Israel Military Industries  and is based on the      pound Mark     There were unconfirmed reports of the IAF also using the GBU    Small Diameter Bomb for the first time     Israeli aircraft also used synthetic aperture radar targeting pods and high resolution imaging pods       After being grounded six months prior  the Israeli fleet of AH  F Cobra helicopter gunships were rushed back into service for the operation       The Israeli Air Force also used unmanned aerial vehicles firing Israeli manufactured Spike missiles  citation needed  According to the IAF      of the bombs used by the IAF were precision weapons  and     of the air strikes hit their targets       A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that when possible  IAF executed strikes using the smallest precision guided weapons  and coordinated air strikes and the use of artillery weapons using GPS  in a systematic effort to limit collateral damage      In a      interview  Major General Ido Nehushtan said that the only use of non precision guided munitions from the Israeli Air Force was in open areas       He went on to say   We had to find ways to do things as precisely and proportionately as possible  while focusing on how to differentiate between terrorists and uninvolved civilians        The IDF also targeted homes of Hamas commanders  noting   Destruction of hundreds of Hamas leaders  homes  is  one of the keys to the offensive s success  The homes serve as weapons warehouses and headquarters  and shelling them has seriously hindered Hamas capabilities        Several high ranking Hamas commanders were killed  including Nizar Rayan  Abu Zakaria al Jamal  and Jamal Mamduch  Hamas leaders often died along with their families in their homes  According to a Hamas spokesperson and Rayyan s son  the IDF warned Rayan  by contacting his cell phone  that an attack on his house was imminent            Some Hamas leaders hid in the basements of the Shifa Hospital complex in Gaza City in the belief that they would be protected by human shields       Hamas Interior Minister Said Seyam  Hamas Interior Ministry Security Director Saleh Abu Sharkh  and local Hamas militia leader Mahmoud Abu Watfah were killed on    January in an Israeli airstrike in Jabalia         Destroyed building in Rafah     January      Among IDF s measures to reduce civilian casualties were the extensive use of leaflets and phone messages to warn Palestinians  including families in high risk areas and families of Hamas personnel  to leave the area or to avoid potential targets                Israel used A   Skyhawks to deliver more than   million leaflets urging the population to evacuate       In a practice codenamed roof knocking  the IDF issued warning calls before air strikes on civilian buildings  Typically  Israeli intelligence officers and Shin Bet security servicemen contacted residents of a building in which they suspected storage of military assets and told them that they had       minutes to flee the attack                 At several instances  the IDF has also used a sound bomb to warn civilians before striking homes       In some cases  IDF commanders called off airstrikes  when residents of suspected houses have been able to gather on its roof       IAF developed small bomb that is designed not to explode as it was aimed at empty areas of the roofs to frighten residents into leaving the building           Israel s military used low explosive missiles to warn civilians of imminent attack and to verify that buildings were evacuated before attacks       Some of the attacks took place sooner than the warning suggested and many calls were not followed up with attacks     The Israeli Government report notes that while the warning systems implemented by the IDF did not eliminate all harm to civilians  they were apparently effective  because in many incidents aerial video surveillance by IDF forces confirmed the departure of numerous residents from targeted areas as a direct result of the warnings before the attacks  While Israel is not a party to the Protocol I  Israel accepts its provisions as reflective of customary international law       By   January       the Palestinian death toll stood at      with     estimated to be civilian casualties       The air offensive continued throughout the ground invasion that followed  and as of    January Israeli forces had carried out       air strikes       No safe haven or bomb shelters existed  making this one of the rare conflicts where civilians had no place to flee       The IAF had so far carried out     aerial sorties and     helicopter missions  and dozens of UAV flight hours were logged   Naval operations The Israeli Navy attacked Hamas  rocket launchers and outposts  command and control centers  a Hamas patrol boat  and the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh  using the Typhoon Weapon System and Surface to surface missiles            The navy coordinated with other Israeli forces and used powerful shipboard sensors to acquire and shell targets on land            Records of the attacks published by the navy indicate that for the first time vessels were equipped with Spike ER electro optically guided anti armor missiles  Videos of an attack showed precision hits from a Typhoon stabilizing gun despite a rolling sea  Versions of the Spike were also used by ground units    and possibly by helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles       Shayetet    naval commandos were also deployed to attack targets on land      and reportedly attacked an Iranian ship loaded with arms for Hamas  which was docking in Sudan       On    December  Naval vessels shelled the Port of Gaza       On    December  the Free Gaza Movement relief boat Dignity carrying volunteer doctors with     tons of medical supplies  human rights activists  Among them Caoimhe Butterly and former US Representative Cynthia McKinney   and a CNN reporter was involved in an altercation with Israeli patrol boats  The captain of the Free Gaza vessel said that their vessel had been rammed intentionally and that there had been no warning before it had been rammed       An Israeli spokesman disputed this  and said the collision was caused by the Dignity attempting to outmaneuver the patrol boats after disobeying Israeli orders to turn back       On   January the Israeli Navy extended its blockade of the Gaza Strip to    nautical miles       Throughout the war  the Israeli Navy employed Sa ar     class missile boats and Super Dvora Mk III class patrol boats   Ground invasion See also       Ibrahim al Maqadna Mosque strike and Zeitoun incident IDF infantry and armor units amassed near the Gaza border on    December  engaging in a blockade of the strip  On    December  a Palestinian mortar attack hit an Israeli military base along the Gaza border  killing one soldier and wounding several others         Explosion in Gaza     January            ISM photo  Damage to the Zeitoun neighbourhood  On the evening of   January Israel began the ground operation with a massive artillery barrage all along the Gaza boundary  and ground forces were sent into Gaza for the first time since the start of the conflict                 The ground invasion  termed the  second stage  of Operation Cast Lead  sought to control open areas and encircle towns and refugee camps from which militants continued to launch rockets  but not penetrate densely populated areas      The Paratroopers  Golani  and Givati brigades simultaneously entered the Gaza Strip from several unexpected directions to avoid reported booby traps while also outflanking opposing forces  The    st Armored Brigade used Merkava Mark IV tanks to quickly block access from Rafah and Khan Yunis to Gaza City  cutting supply lines to Hamas from the south     The move put psychological pressure on Hamas while also forcing combatants to withdraw from the front line  Israeli forces took strategic hilltops to better control areas         Weapons found in a mosque during Operation Cast Lead  according to the IDF The Israeli advance was spearheaded by Combat Engineering Corps sappers opening routes and allowing the ground forces to advance while dismantling booby traps set up in great numbers by Hamas  often set to detonate upon entry to a building  Improvised explosive devices  IED  were a concern for Israeli soldiers      One Israeli commander said that booby traps were found in a mosque and one third of the houses  He said that some of the traps were designed to assist in taking IDF soldiers captive  All such attempts failed          The IDF used D  armored bulldozers to ensure that paths were cleared of IEDs  These bulldozers were also used to destroy tunnels  The unmanned  remote controlled version of the D   called Black Thunder  were also used  In one case an armored D  knocked down a door  which triggered an explosion of a building full of explosive on top of the D   The D  survived the explosion and building s collapse  Combat engineers that inspected the rubbles found a tunnel  cache of weapons and remains of a suicide bomber       Viper miniature robots were deployed by Israeli forces for the first time  These were used for various tasks including the disabling of IEDs  Along with blocking mobile phone communication  the IDF employed electronic jamming equipment to disable remote operated explosives       Among others  The IDF used the new Bull Island system for the first time to identify booby traps in buildings  Bull Island uses a camera shaped like a tennis ball that can be thrown into a building to transfer     degree imagery to the troops outside of the structure          Israeli artillery units worked closely with battalion commanders       For the first time  the Sheder Ham digitized data  mapping  and command and control system linked the Artillery Corps into the Army s overall C I network       Israel artillery fired approximately       rounds during the conflict  An Israel Defense Forces colonel stated that tactics and procedures had to suit the difficult urban environment  The number of rounds in the    day conflict was    of the total fired during the    day Lebanon war  Under the condition of anonymity  another officer said that close air support missions accounted for more than     of rounds fired  He also said that about half of those were MA  A  incendiary based smoke rounds used to mask troop movements  The Oketz Unit  the IDF s dog handling corps  performed    successful missions during the war  with specially trained sniffer and attack dogs and their handlers leading advancing forces  In every mission that involved Oketz dogs  there were no casualties among soldiers  Three dogs were killed by enemy fire during the war       Hamas guerrillas sometimes emerged from tunnels to fire at IDF soldiers  then pulled back to lure troops into built up areas  In one case  a Palestinian dressed in an Israeli Army uniform opened fire on a group of soldiers  but was killed before he could cause any casualties  In several instances  would be suicide bombers with explosive vests charged Israeli soldiers  but all were killed before they could reach their targets  citation needed  Israeli ground troops entered Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza in the early hours of   January       Israeli forces reportedly bisected Gaza and surrounded Gaza City       but restricted their movements to areas that

continued to launch airstrikes and naval bombardments    IDF forces discover weapons in a mosque during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip  On   January  heavy fighting took place between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants on the outskirts of the northern district of Gaza City  while Israeli helicopter gunships pounded militant positions  The IDF reportedly widened its attacks to Khan Yunis in southern Gaza  after heavy fighting on the edges of Deir al Balah in central Gaza       The Al Fakhura school was hit by Israeli mortar fire  and reports on deaths and if militants were among the casualties varied                 The attack was originally reported as being on the school       In northern Gaza City  Palestinian gunmen ambushed an Israeli patrol  killing one soldier and wounding four  The patrol returned fire  hitting some of the gunmen       while in Jabalya  an Israeli tank fired a shell into an abandoned building as Golani Brigade soldiers were taking cover in it  killing   soldiers and wounding     The casualties were extracted under the cover of heavy artillery fire and helicopters dropping illumination bombs       In a separate friendly fire incident  an Israeli officer was killed by a misdirected artillery shell  In all  at least    Palestinians and   Israelis were killed on   January        Arms interdiction and the Sudan strike Main article

Golani Brigade was also killed  In Northern Gaza  snipers opened fire on Israeli forces conducting an operation  killing an Israeli soldier  Another Israeli soldier was lightly wounded  The IDF soldiers identified the origin of the fire and returned fire  directly hitting the snipers  In another incident  several mortar shells were fired at Givati Brigade soldiers  who responded with mortar fire and were aided by IAF airstrikes       In Central Gaza  a force of IDF soldiers entered a building near the Kissfum crossing  As the force entered  Hamas fighters fired an anti tank rocket at them  killing one Israeli officer and wounding one soldier  Israeli aircraft also hit more than    Hamas targets in Gaza       Israeli troops shot and killed Hamas commander Amir Mansi and wounded two other Hamas fighters as they operated a mortar       The IAF attacked over    Hamas targets  A rocket fired from Gaza wounded seven IDF soldiers in Southern Israel  On    January  the Israeli military said that another    sites were targeted  and that    Hamas fighters were killed       On    January  the IDF started the third stage of the operation with an attack on the suburbs of Gaza City  Israeli forces pushed into the south of the city and reached a key junction to its north  During their advance  Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters ambushed Israeli troops at several locations  and heavy fighting ensued  in which    Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters were killed       Additionally  the IAF reported that Hamas operatives had tried to shoot down an IAF plane with anti aircraft missiles for the first time since operations in Gaza began  Heavy machine gun fire against helicopters had also been unsuccessful      Two Hamas fighters were killed by an Israeli airstrike in the Southern Gaza Strip  A Palestinian woman was also killed by Israeli artillery fire       Israeli forces continued to push deeper into heavily populated areas around Gaza City  Fierce clashes were reported in the Southern suburb of Sheikh Ajleen       On    January  nearly    rockets and mortars were fired at Southern Israel  damaging a house in Ashkelon    Palestinians in a Gaza city neighbourhood on Day

Tel al Hawa neighborhood in the northeast  The Israeli Army also said that    mortars and rockets were fired into Southern Israel            Before dawn  during the night  Israeli troops and tanks supported by artillery and helicopters advanced     metres into Tel al Hawa  a neighborhood with several high rise buildings  while Israeli gunboats shelled Hamas targets along the coast       As troops entered the narrow streets  heavy street fighting with militants ensued leaving three Israeli soldiers wounded and    Hamas militants dead or wounded  according to the IDF  By morning IDF soldiers were still advancing slowly towards the city center and several buildings were in flames in Tel al Hawa  where most of the fighting took place  Five Israeli soldiers were wounded during clashes with militants  and an officer was severely wounded by an explosion inside a booby trapped building       The push into the neighborhood was Israel s deepest incursion into Gaza City  There was widespread desertion by members of the Qassam Brigades in the face of the IDF advance     On    January  Israeli artillery started an intense bombardment of the city while fighting was still going on in the streets  Troops and tanks advanced deeper into the city following the shelling  The Israeli military claimed to have killed dozens of militants since breaching the city limits four days

Agency  UNRWA  was also shelled on    January  There were   people injured and tons of food and fuel intended for         Palestinian refugees were destroyed       The Associated Press initially reported that an anonymous Israeli military official stated that Gaza militants had fired anti tank weapons and machine guns from inside the compound  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said  it is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place  but the consequences are very sad and we apologize for it  I don t think it should have happened and I m very sorry   After UNRWA dismissed this as  nonsense   Israel ordered an army investigation into the incident       Israeli officials afterwards  came forward to say that preliminary results showed that the militants ran for safety inside the U N  compound after firing on Israeli forces from outside        On    January  more than    Israeli airstrikes were carried out against militants  tunnels  and a mosque suspected of being used as a weapons store  Israeli forces continued their push into Gaza City  while Israeli Navy vessels shelled militant targets in support       About    rockets were fired into Southern Israel

swept into the Tel al Hawa neighborhood and took over two    story buildings in search of Hamas operatives two days before the cease fire went into effect  About    Palestinian fighters were killed during the operation  The commander of the brigade  Colonel Ilan Malka  was critical of Hamas  use of civilian houses and said that he  took many steps to prevent our soldiers from getting hurt   Malka told reporters that the IDF had initially predicted each battalion would lose six or seven soldiers       The Israeli government considered a third phase of the operation with the intent of dealing a  knock out blow  to Hamas  Military and intelligence assessments indicating that shifting the goal to destroying Hamas would require additional weeks of deep ground incursions into urban areas and refugee camps  This was expected to result in heavy casualties on both sides and among civilians  reduce the strong domestic support for the war  and increase international criticism       Humanitarian ceasefires Due to the number of civilian casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian situation  Israel faced significant international pressure for a ceasefire  the establishment of a humanitarian corridor  access to the population of Gaza and the lifting of the blockade       On   January  Israel opened a humanitarian corridor to allow the shipment of aid into Gaza  The Israeli army agreed to interrupt fighting for three hours and Hamas agreed not to launch rockets during the pause                 Israel repeated the ceasefire either daily or every other day  Aid officials and the UN praised the truce  but said it was not enough as fighting usually resumed immediately following the humanitarian ceasefires                      An Israeli Government report  published in July       notes that during the period between   and    January  Hamas fired a total of    rockets and mortars at Israel during humanitarian pauses       An independent report commissioned jointly by the Israeli NGO Physicians for Human Rights and the Palestinian Medical Relief Society notes that according to testimonies by local witnesses  there were several cases where IDF ground forces breached the daily ceasefire agreement        Palestinian paramilitary activity  According to Human Rights Watch rockets from Gaza were fired from populated areas       According to Abu Ahmed  the official media spokesman of the Al Quds Brigades  the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement  Palestinian paramilitary factions in Gaza worked together  operationally and otherwise  to repel the Israeli attack on Gaza  Abu Ahmed told Asharq al Awsat during the war that   everybody helps everybody else with regards to food  weapons  and first aid  there is no difference between a member  Al Quds Brigade  or  Al Qassam Brigade  military wing of Hamas   or  Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade  or  Abu Ali Mustafa Brigade  military wing of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine or PFLP    For everybody s goal is the same and their compass is pointing in the same direction  and that is to drive out the occupation and defeat them  and disrupt their plan to dissolve the Palestinian Cause        Hamas said that  rockets fired from Gaza were meant to hit military targets  but because they are unguided  they hit civilians by mistake        Political representatives for Hamas  Islamic Jihad  the PFLP  Saiqa  the Popular Struggle Front  the Revolutionary Communist Party  Palestinian Liberation Organisation  Fatah s  Intifada  faction  and a number of other Palestinian factions in Syria formed a temporary alliance during the offensive as well  They issued a joint statement refusing  any security arrangements that affect the resistance and its legitimate right to struggle against the occupation   and refusing proposals suggesting international forces be sent to Gaza  The coalition also affirmed that any peace initiatives must include an end to the blockade  and an opening of all of Gaza s crossings  including the Rafah crossing with Egypt      Preparation  A Grad rocket hitting Beersheba  Hamas used the months leading to the war to prepare for urban warfare  which was to give them a chance to inflict casualties on the Israeli military       Militants booby trapped houses and buildings and built an extensive system of tunnels in preparation for combat       A Hamas fighter reported that the group had prepared a tunnel network in Gaza city that would allow Hamas to engage the IDF in urban warfare       IDF commanders said that many Hamas members have dug tunnels for themselves under their homes and hid weapon caches in them       Some houses were booby trapped with mannequins  explosives and adjacent tunnels  Israeli officers said that houses were set up this way so that  Israeli soldiers would shoot the mannequin  mistaking it for a man  an explosion would occur  and the soldiers would be driven or pulled into the hole  where they could be taken prisoner   A colonel estimated that one third of all houses encountered were booby trapped       IDF Brigadier General Eyal Eisenberg said that roadside bombs were planted in TV satellite dishes  adding that Hamas booby trapping of homes and schools was  monstrous  and  inhumane        Ron Ben Yishai  an Israeli military correspondent embedded with invading ground forces  stated that entire blocks of houses were booby trapped and wired in preparation for urban confrontation with the IDF  Israel said a map showing the deployment of explosives and Hamas forces in the al Atatra neighborhood in northern Gaza was found  The map reportedly showed that Hamas placed many explosives and firing positions in residential areas  several mosques  and next to a gas station       Israel deployed the elite Sayeret Yahalom combat engineering unit throughout the brigades with new equipment including miniature robots and improved wall breaching munitions to counter the booby traps       An example of a weapons cache found in northern Gaza  According to Jane s Defence Weekly  armed groups in Gaza counted domestically produced anti armor RPGs like al Battar and Banna   and Banna   in their arsenal       Hamas and Islamic Jihad also manufactured a variety of improvised explosive devices  IEDs   some of which were anti personnel bombs and others were planted on the sides of roads or underground to be activated against tanks and armored personnel carriers  According to The Jerusalem Post  some of the IEDs were manufactured from medicine bottles transferred to the Gaza Strip as humanitarian aid by Israel       The same newspaper also reported that Hamas representatives said they were fighting with the aid of armored vehicles and weapons confiscated from the Palestinian National Authority  given by Israel  the United States and other countries         A weapons cache in found in northern Gaza  At least one Palestinian witness told an Italian reporter that on many roofs of the tall buildings that were hit by Israeli bombs  including UN building  there were rocket launchers or Hamas look outs            On    January  the Shin Bet released details given by Hamas captives  including the militants  use of mosques for weapon caches and military training  Militants admitted to the location of Hamas weapon storage sites  in tunnels  in the homes of activists  and in citrus groves and mosques  and told of theory instruction given in mosques as well       Following the visit of the British Army veteran Colonel Tim Collins to the ruins of one of the mosques targeted by the IDF in Rafah  he said that in his view the evidencies of the secondary explosion  that could have indicated weapon s storage in the mosque  are present        Palestinian rockets in Gaza According to Human Right Watch  On    December       a rocket struck a bedroom of a family living in the Tel al Hawa area in southern Gaza City  critically wounding one man  The brother of this victim told after the incident no armed group came to apologize   I was next door in my home when this all happened  When one of those responsible tried to bargain for the shrapnel  I said that if no one took responsibility I will go to the courts  so Hamas came to me privately and admitted it   On    December       a Palestinian rocket struck north of Beit Lahiya  a house was hit killing two cousins and wounding another  The grandfather described the rocket as about one meter in length  according to Human Rights Watch examination the diameter of the pipe is     mm  The grandfather said the rocket was taken by Hamas policemen for investigation   After he left  the war started and we never heard from him again  We got the compensation given to all victims of the war         Rocket attacks into

 Hamas quickly dispersed both its personnel and weapons and equipment       According to Human Rights Watch rockets from Gaza were fired from populated areas  an Islamic Jihad fighter said   the most important thing is achieving our military goals     We stay away from the houses if we can  but that s often impossible        According to BBC  Palestinian groups had been firing  in response to Israeli massacres       The strike range of Hamas rockets had increased from    km      mi  to    km     mi  since early      with the use of improved Qassam and factory made rockets       These attacks resulted in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure       Rockets reached major Israeli cities Ashdod  Beersheba and Gedera for the first time  putting one eighth of Israel s population in rocket range       On   January      Ma an News Agency reported   The Al Qassam Brigades  military wing of Hamas  said that after a week since the start of the  Battle of Al Furqan  the criterion   it has managed to fire     rockets  at an average of    rockets daily       As of    January       Palestinian militants had launched approximately     rockets and     mortars at Israel since the beginning of the conflict  according to Israeli security sources       A source close to Hamas described the movement s use of stealth when firing   They fired rockets in between the houses and covered the alleys with sheets so they could set the rockets up in five minutes without the planes seeing them  The moment they fired  they escaped  and they are very quick        It is reported that     rockets and    mortars were fired by Fatah  Hamas  chief rival       Besides the rockets fired by the Qassam Brigades of Hamas  other factions claimed responsibility for rockets fired into Israel and attacks on Israeli soldiers  including Al Aqsa Martyrs  Brigades  affiliated with Fatah   the Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades  the Quds Brigades and the Popular Resistance Councils     A Fatah official stated that the rocket attacks by his faction contradicted the official position of Mahmoud Abbas  Fatah leader and President of the Palestinian National Authority  Abbas had called on all sides to cease hostilities unconditionally  Militants fired over     rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel during the conflict       Bersheeba and Gedera were the farthest areas hit by rocket or mortars       The rockets killed three civilians and one IDF soldier and wounded     people  with another     people suffering from shock and anxiety       The rockets also caused property damage  including damage to three schools                 Senior Hamas official Mahmoud al Zahar stated during the operation  they  Israeli forces  shelled everyone in Gaza     They shelled children and hospitals and mosques      and in doing so  they gave us legitimacy to strike them in the same way        Human Rights Watch noted in the open letter to Ismail Haniyeh that despite his Foreign Ministry stance as part of response to the Goldstone Report  Palestinian armed groups remain responsible for firing rockets indiscriminately or deliberately at Israeli civilian objects  HRW also noted that Palestinian militants put Palestinian civilians at risk of Israeli counter attacks by launching rockets from populated areas       The UN fact finding mission stated that the firing of rockets at Israel constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was in violation of international law      After the war  the Izz ad Din al Qassam Brigades revealed new rockets it used during Israel s military operation and published pictures of weapons  Tandem and RPG    anti armor rockets  that it could secretly smuggle to Gaza         Repairs being made to water pipe after it was hit a by a rocket  Besides being hit with rockets fired from Gaza  Israel experienced other attacks along the borders with Lebanon and Syria        Unilateral ceasefires On    January  Israeli officials announced a unilateral ceasefire  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared the ceasefire effective that night  at       GMT on    January       The ceasefire consisted of two phases   First a ceasefire is declared  If Hamas stops firing rockets then Israel pulls its forces out of the Gaza Strip  If rocket fire resumes then the IDF goes back in  this time with the international backing gained by having tried a truce   Olmert declared that the military objectives had been met            Hamas initially  vowed to fight on        and responded that any continued Israeli presence in Gaza would be regarded as an act of war  Farzi Barhoum  a Hamas spokesman  said before the ceasefire began   The occupier must halt his fire immediately and withdraw from our land and lift his blockade and open all crossings and we will not accept any one Zionist soldier on our land  regardless of the price that it costs        Palestinian militants resumed rocket fire into southern Israel the following Sunday morning  four of the six fired landed in or near Sderot            The Israeli military returned fire and launched an air strike against the rocket launching site in northern Gaza       On    January Hamas  Islamic Jihad and other paramilitias said they would stop launching rockets into Israel for one week and demanded  the withdrawal of the enemy forces from the Gaza Strip within a week  along with the opening of all the crossings for the entry of humanitarian aid  food and other necessities for our people in the Gaza Strip                  Three days later  the last Israeli troops left Gaza       Since the unilateral ceasefires were declared on    January  militants have fired rockets and mortar shells from Gaza            and the IDF has launched airstrikes against Gaza        Continued negotiations Egyptian mediators held discussions with Israel and Hamas about extending the cease fire by a year or more  Hamas and Fatah met to allow both to play a role in rebuilding       Israel began pressuring Egypt to do more to stop weapons smuggling into Gaza  the halting of which is one of Israel s central demands in extending a cease fire  On    January       Foreign Minister of Egypt Ahmed Aboul Gheit discouraged Britain  France and Germany from sending warships to patrol the waters off Gaza  which the three European nations felt could help halt seaborne smuggling  Gheit said such efforts would harm Europe s relations with the Arab world  Egypt also opposed proposals for European troops to be stationed on the border between Gaza and Egypt to monitor smuggling tunnels       Israel  along with many Western and some Arab countries  wanted international aid groups to control aid from donations around the world  so that Hamas would not receive credit for the rebuilding  To speed up reconstruction  Hamas agreed that it would not insist on collecting reconstruction money itself and would allow donated money to flow through different avenues based on the various alliances  although Hamas ultimately expected to administer the aid  But advisors to senior Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said Israel s willingness to open the border for humanitarian aid only was unacceptable  as Hamas would need much more to rebuild its economy and provide relief for citizens  Haniyeh aides said the cease fire is contingent on a full border opening       Shortly after becoming President of the United States  Barack Obama directed newly appointed special envoy to the Middle East George J  Mitchell to visit Israel  the West Bank  Egypt  Jordan  Turkey and Saudi Arabia for peace talks  Mitchell began his meetings in Cairo on    January       and Obama said his visit was part of the President s campaign promise to listen to both sides of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and work toward a Middle East peace deal  Mitchell did not plan to talk to Hamas  but instead focus on talks with the more moderate Palestinian Authority       A spokesman for Haniyeh said he respected Mitchell  but was disappointed with the envoy s decision not to hold discussions with Hamas       Ehud Olmert stated that Israel would not agree to a long term truce or lift the blockade on Gaza without the freeing of Gilad Shalit  an IDF soldier held captive in Gaza since June                 Hamas demanded that Israel release       Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit and such negotiations be kept separate from ceasefire negotiations        Post war military assessment The war was an Israeli tactical victory and a significant tactical defeat for Hamas               Al Qassam Brigades reported in  The outcome of al Qassam operations during the Battle of al Furqan  they killed     Israeli soldiers  On    January       a spokesperson for the group said on al Arabiya  Israel lost  at least    soldiers  in the fighting  and said about Hamas losses  only    fighters slain in Israel war   According to United Nations report of the Independent International Fact Finding Mission of Human Rights Council  which was on General Assembly s agenda on    October        The large discrepancy in the data confirms the Mission s observations below in the report about the reliability of the information about the Gaza military operations posted on websites of al Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups        In November       the Hamas Interior Minister acknowledged that around     militants part of Hamas and affiliated factions were killed in the war       Several senior Hamas military commanders and politburo members were killed  as well as approximately    explosives experts     Hamas experienced  widespread desertion  in the face of the Israeli advance     Hamas also lost a very large amount of weaponry and equipment  key storage facilities were discovered under mosques and public buildings     A former Shin Bet deputy director who co authored a report on the war noted   Hamas had planned to stand and fight  but the Iz al Qassam Brigades proved unequal to the task     and consequently they failed to match the public image Hamas has tried so hard to present of stalwart  proficient Islamic warriors        In addition  the Israeli operation greatly curtailed years of Hamas rocket fire  returning a sense of normalcy to Southern Israel       In the year before the war  Hamas had fired over       rockets at Israel s Gaza periphery towns  That number dropped to less than     in the ten months following the conflict       Defense analyst David Eshel stated   The success of Operation Cast Lead in the densely populated Gaza Strip shows that an industrial military that coordinates operations among land  air and sea units  makes effective use of advanced technology  and shares intelligence and leads from the front can decisively defeat an asymmetrical enemy   He further noted   Israel used a variety of tactics to outflank and defeat Hamas in its own territory  These included long term planning  meticulous intelligence gathering  deception and disinformation      As a result of its poor performance  Hamas relieved at least two brigade commanders on Iranian advice  and reportedly stripped     fighters of their membership  The organization decided to initiate a thorough investigation of the conduct of its fighters during the operation          Hamas  leadership modified its tactical doctrine  The Qassam Brigades intensified military training at its various training camps and military academy in the Nuseirat refugee camp  The new training was thought to be more offensive  with a focus on hitting the rear of an IDF force  Hezbollah operatives were suspected of involvement in the program  In contrast to the pre war period  when Hamas openly displayed its capabilities  the nature of the program was kept classified     The Israeli army said it destroyed about     of the tunnels between Gaza and Egypt that were being used to bring in weapons and rocket components  Residents in Rafah said they cleared away debris and discovered that many of the tunnels were intact  though they acknowledged the destruction of many        Casualties Main article  Casualties of the Gaza War Human Rights organisations and the UN counted just above       Palestinian deaths               Israel acknowledged       deaths           According to PCHR  among the Palestinian deaths were     unarmed civilians      police officers  and     fighters      B Tselem counted     killed police officers      Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights said in January       that       people were killed  among them     children and     women  and     of those killed were not combatants  The IDF tallied     killed civilians  least     armed militants and     undetermined           The Hamas Interior Minister Fathi Hamad stated that between     and     Hamas fighters  another     security forces and     policemen were killed            During the war    Israeli civilians were killed by rocket attacks  A total of    Israeli soldiers were killed in the war  of whom   were killed by enemy action and   were killed by friendly fire           Civilians versus combatants During the           Gaza fighting I personally erased a key detail that Hamas fighters were dressed as civilians and being counted as civilians in the death toll because of a threat to our reporter in Gaza   The policy was then  and remains  not to inform readers that the story is censored unless the censorship is Israeli  Earlier this month  the AP s Jerusalem news editor reported and submitted a story on Hamas intimidation  the story was shunted into deep freeze by his superiors and has not been published    Matti Friedman      In any conflict  the ratio of combatant and civilian deaths is a highly sensitive topic  During the fighting in the Gaza War  the main source for the number of Palestinian casualties was Hamas  Ministry of Health in Gaza  The ICRC used these figures  but at a later stage it made its own assessment       Because Israel allowed very few international workers and journalists in Gaza during much of the conflict  it has been difficult to verify the figures independently       In The Jerusalem Post  Israeli Arab journalist Khaled Abu Toameh suggested that killed fighters in civilian clothes led to the over counting of civilian casualties and under counting Hamas military casualties  as Palestinian casualties arrived at hospitals without weapons or any other signs revealing they were fighters       B Tselem wrote that its fatalities classification was based on the guidelines of the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC  published in June       The PCHR civilian count includes Hamas members killed in what the PCHR assessed were non combat situations  The Al Mezan centre defined combatants as  those taking up arms against Israeli troops        The Israeli International Institute for Counter Terrorism      and SPME      have contested the classifications of B Tselem and PCHR   Gazan police During the conflict Israel targeted numerous police facilities in Gaza  Many of these attacks occurred during the first minutes of the operations resulting in the deaths of    policemen and nine other members of the public           The attacks on Police during the first day of the operation included the bombing of a police cadet graduation ceremony  killing scores of police cadets along with family members who had come to attend the celebration  Police cadets killed in the incident included traffic police and musicians in the police orchestra            The UN fact finding mission established that approximately     Gaza policemen were killed by Israeli forces during the course of the conflict constituting over one sixth of the total Palestinian casualties       Legality The UN Fact Finding Mission analysed the police institutions in Gaza from the time Hamas gained control  They concluded that the Gaza police were a civilian law enforcement agency and that Israel s blanket targeting of the Gaza police was therefore a violation of international humanitarian law      Human Rights Watch stated that police are presumptively civilians but on a specific case by case basis can be considered valid targets if formally incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict or directly participate in the hostilities  They stressed that blanket decisions must not be made about police being legitimate targets and that a decision that police and police stations are legitimate military targets depends on whether those police play a role in fighting against Israel  or whether a particular police station is used to store weapons or for some other military purpose       B Tselem also states that police officers are presumed to be civilians and likely not legitimate objects of attack under international humanitarian law        Israeli views The Israeli Orient Research Group reported that    of the    killed during this first IAF strike were terror operatives  many of them belonging to the militant group  al Qassam Brigades  citation needed  The Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs further reported that     of the     police officers killed during the offensive were members of terror organizations and that another    fighters belonged to units undergoing infantry training  citation needed  It noted that the security apparatuses participated in terror activity and that the Hamas leadership presented these organizations as at the forefront of the jihad for liberating all of Palestine            The IDF made clear that it regards police under the control of Hamas in Gaza to be equivalent to the enemies armed fighters  including them in the militant s count           A government paper published pictures of four men that were killed during the military operations that they claim were downloaded from Palestinian websites  The men are identified in the different pictures as both policemen and members of al Qassam Brigades       Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center  ITIC  alleged that the distinction between the internal security forces and Hamas military wing is not sharply defined and cites Gaza police officials who said that police were instructed to fight the enemy in case of an invasion into the Gaza Strip            Many security force members were reported to  moonlight  with the militant group  Izzidin al Qassam Brigades        Gazan rockets During the conflict  Palestinian groups fired rockets targeting Israeli civilians in the cities of Ashdod  Beersheba and Gedera placing     of the Israeli population at risk  The military wing of Hamas said that after a week from the start  it had managed to fire     rockets  at an average of    rockets daily      rockets and    mortars were fired by Fatah at Israel  Over     rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into Israel during the conflict wounded     civilians  killing   people  and causing minor suffering to another     people suffering from shock and anxiety  Several rockets landed in schools and one fell close to a kindergarten  all located in residential areas  The UN fact finding mission stated that this constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was unjustifiable in international law                  Aftermath Israel was victorious militarily  but its reputation was harmed     The international community continued to isolate Hamas  except for Iran and Syria   because it rejected the Quartet demands to recognize Israel  accept the Oslo accords peace initiative and abandon violence in exchange for international recognition as representatives of the Palestinian people       In the months following the war  Hamas suspended its use of rockets and shifted focus to winning support at home and abroad through cultural initiatives and public relations  with the aim to build a  cultural resistance   Hamas officials stated that  The current situation required a stoppage of rockets  After the war  the fighters needed a break and the people needed a break         Propaganda and psychological warfare Hamas Before and during the conflict  Hamas  senior representatives released a number of statements designed to avert Israeli decision makers from launching any military operation in Gaza and to cause demoralization among Israelis  Before the end of the pre conflict ceasefire  Hamas boasted that it had countless surprises awaiting Israeli troops  should they advance       Hamas representatives threatened on several occasions to abduct Israeli soldiers  and during the ground invasion tried to spread rumors that it actually had captured or killed more Israeli soldiers       On a video broadcast on Al Aqsa TV on    January showing the names of Israeli towns hit by rockets  it was implied Tel Aviv is the next target and that  all options are open        Also  Hamas sent messages in Hebrew to Israeli citizens  mobile phones warning   Rockets on all cities  shelters will not protect you             Hamas instrumentalized the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit as a form of psychological weapon  declaring that he had been wounded by Israeli fire  later announcing that his condition was no longer of interest to them       According to IDF spokesman  Hamas  ruses in the battlefield included booby traps throughout Gaza s neighborhoods  such as mannequins placed at apartment entrances and rigged to explode when the soldiers approach       Arab television stations reported Hamas provided statistics for Israeli casualties on the assumption that Israel is distorting its own figures of soldiers killed and wounded       A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies notes that Hamas propaganda both rejected Hamas responsibility for the fighting and used it to attack the Palestinian Authority      Dr  Tal Pavel from Israeli think tank International Policy Institute for Counter Terrorism  ICT  said that Hamas uses its Web sites to make comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany  portraying Israel as a destructive  oppressive regime afraid of Hamas rockets raining on Tel Aviv        Israel The day before the beginning of the offensive on    December the IDF pulled troops back from the border and used its radio channels to broadcast talk of a  lull  to achieve a disinformation coup to lure Hamas fighters out of hiding       A broadcaster in Islamic Jihad s Voice of Jerusalem radio station in Gaza City reported that IDF have been breaking into his station signal  least once an hour  during conflict intensification to broadcast messages to Gaza s population that their problems were due to Hamas  The Israelis also dropped leaflets with similar messages and contact info to report about the whereabouts of militant leaders and weapons caches       The leaflets also noted   The Israeli army will respond if the rocket fire continues        In war zones  leaflets warned local residents that they had to flee  It also warned residents that their homes would be targeted if they were located in an area of possible target       Dr  Yaniv Levitan of the University of Haifa said that the aim of the flyers was not to demoralize the civil population  but to implant recognition in hearts and minds that Hamas has failed  that there is an option of choosing another path       IDF spokespersons often reported that scores of demoralized Hamas fighters had been observed deserting  According to Ephraim Kam  deputy head of the Institute of National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University  the claim could not be confirmed but it strengthened the Israeli population s will to continue and undermined the confidence of Hamas in Gaza       There was a mistrust of phone calls warning messages to people that they have  just minutes to evacuate before they bomb the house   According to a human rights lawyer at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights  PCHR   despite the hundreds of phone calls to families warning their house is about to be blown up  only    were destroyed  presumably as of   January date        Controversies regarding tactics Main article  International Law and the Gaza War Both Israel and Hamas were accused of using controversial military tactics during the           Gaza War   Controversial tactics allegedly used by Hamas Civilians as human shields Israel maintained that Hamas used civilians  and especially children  as human shields  as a part of its war doctrine  They said that Hamas repeatedly called upon Palestinian civilians to gather near buildings where they feared that the IDF was about to launch air strikes against Hamas targets  They documented several examples of what they described as  calls in the Hamas controlled Gaza media for Palestinians civilians to serve as human shields   They released footage allegedly showing Hamas  Al Aqsa TV calling upon children to form a human shield at various structures in Gaza to prevent anticipated IDF airstrikes  and an Al Aqsa TV News broadcast describing how a crowd of civilians gathered on the roof of Abu Bilal al Ja abeer to stop the IDF from executing an airstrike           Amnesty International s investigation of these claims found no evidence that Hamas or any other Palestinian militant group had  directed the movement of civilians to shield military objectives from attacks   It did find that Israeli soldiers had deployed Palestinian civilians and children to shield themselves            The IDF released a video taken by an UAV drone during the war  saying that it showed a Hamas militant launching a rocket from a roof of a residential house and then leaving surrounded by children to avoid being targeted by the IDF       Later  the IDF and Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs compiled a film accusing Hamas of a systematic use of civilian infrastructure and civilians as a human shield  The film includes photos and videos documenting Hamas  uses of a human shield  as well as incitement of children and using them for paramilitary activity and even as suicide bombers            Israeli Air Force videos allegedly show terrorists using groups of children as cover to escape from combat areas and joining groups of children       The former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan  Col  Richard Kemp  testified at UN Human Rights Council   th Special Session that Israel encountered an  enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population             The commander of the military terrorist wing of the PFLP GC in the Gaza Strip stated in an interview that some areas did not present a problem because of the  population and building density  that would  provide the resistance with a shield          Hamas operation centre in the middle of a civilian area  Professor Newton  expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of United Nations Fact Finding Mission criticised a statement by a Hamas brigade commander who said   The entire people of Gaza are the combatants and therefore  it is appropriate for us to issue warnings and then whether   if  even if they disregard them  to occupy their basement or their house or their backyard   Professor Newton stated that the legal obligation was to never commingle civilian and military objectives       The New York Times quotes a study published by the Israel based Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center  charging Hamas with methodically building its military infrastructure in the heart of population centers  According to the study  Hamas not only hides among the population  but has made a main component of its combat strategy  channeling  the army into the densely populated areas to fight       During the Gaza War  Hamas invested great effort in preventing civilians from leaving neighborhoods that were in the line of fire and letting them flee to the south of the Strip       After Israeli forces fired shells near a UN school in Gaza killing around    people  Israel s military said the shelling was in response to mortar fire from within the school and asserted that Hamas were using civilians as cover  They stated that the dead near the school included Hamas members of a rocket launching cell  Two residents of the area confirmed that a group of militants were firing mortar shells from near the school and identified two of the victims as Hamas militants       The Goldstone report found indications that Palestinian armed groups launched rockets from urban areas  The Mission was not able to obtain any direct evidence of specific intent of shielding the rocket launchers from counterstrokes by the Israeli armed forces       From a legal perspective  the report said that the launching of attacks close to civilian buildings would have unnecessarily exposed the civilian population of Gaza and violated the customary rules of international humanitarian law and the right to life of the endangered civilians      The Goldstone report concluded that there was evidence of the presence of Palestinian armed groups in residential areas  The report noted that because of the densely populated nature of the northern half of the Gaza strip  once the Israeli forces gained control of the outlying areas in the first few days of the ground invasion  most  if not all  locations still accessible to the Palestinian militants would have been in urban areas  It would be difficult to avoid mixing with the civilian population in the small and overcrowded Gaza Strip  The report concluded that the Israeli Government had not produced any evidence to support its allegation that Palestinian combatants  mingle routinely with civilians in order to cover their movements        According to the book The Goldstone Report  Reconsidered   a compilation of essays authored by legal scholars and published by the pro Israel group NGO Monitor  the conclusions were false and largely based on unverified claims made by NGOs             Combatant use of civilian clothes A New York Times journalist asserted that Hamas militants were fighting in civilian clothes       Some NGO reports suggested that in general members of Palestinian armed groups did not wear military uniforms and mixed with the civilian population       The UN Fact Finding Mission  Goldstone Mission   however  concluded in its report   While reports reviewed by the Mission credibly indicate that members of Palestinian armed groups were not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from civilians  the Mission found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack         Military use of medical facilities and uniforms An IDF investigation concluded that Hamas forced the Red Crescent to hand over medic and nurse uniforms for its operatives and commandeered ambulances for fighters transportation during the War  Palestinian civilians living in Gaza detailed Hamas  attempts to hijack ambulances and the wearing of paramedic uniforms by Hamas fighters  An ambulance driver registered with and trained by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society spoke of Hamas  efforts to  lure the ambulances into the heart of a battle to transport fighters to safety  and the hijacking of the al Quds Hospital s fleet of ambulances                      The IDF claimed that Hamas operated a command and control center inside Shifa Hospital in Gaza City throughout the War  and that Hamas field commanders exploited the daily cessation in fighting that the IDF established for humanitarian purposes to receive instructions from senior Hamas officials  Addressing the Israeli cabinet  an intelligence official claimed that senior members of Hamas sought refuge in the sub level floors believing that Israel would not target them for fear that such a strike would invariably lead to heavy collateral damage to the hospital patients in the upper floors       Next to the hospital  Militants set up posts that were used for the firing of mortars  Underneath a mosque that was located alongside the hospital was discovered a tunnel leading to the maternity ward  which was used by Hamas operatives to move undetected  After an Israeli airstrike on the central prison  which resulted in prisoners being released into the streets  several of the     prisoners accused of collaboration with Israel who had not yet been tried were executed by Hamas militants wearing civilian clothes in the Shifa hospital compound            The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center  an Israel based group with close ties to the Israeli military establishment       reported that Hamas made extensive use of the Al Fahoura Medical Centre and that they established a military camp and training base next to it  The ITIC released aerial pictures showing tunnels dug around the building and the medical centre and that the area surrounding the hospital was heavily mined  Rockets were launched in close proximity of the centre  The ITIC report stated that Hamas used    Gazan hospitals for launching rockets at Israeli towns and for attacking IDF troops       Hamas also set up a command centre within a children s hospital located in the Nasser neighbourhood of Gaza City  which was used by top Hamas leadership on the night of    December  Senior Hamas commanders also set up a command center in a Red Crescent Society clinic in Khan Yunis            An IDF probe  released on    April       stated that a UN vehicle was attacked by Israeli forces because a Palestinian anti tank squad was being unloaded from the vehicle       Amnesty International rejected the charges by Israel that Hamas had systematically used medical facilities  vehicles and uniforms as a cover  stating that no evidence had been provided proving such actions       Further  Magen David Adom s submission to the UN Mission investigating the war stated  there was no use of PRCS ambulances for the transport of weapons or ammunition      and  there was no misuse of the emblem by PRCS        Following its investigations the Goldstone report concluded that it  did not find any evidence to support the allegations that hospital facilities were used by the Gaza authorities or by Palestinian armed groups to shield military activities and that ambulances were used to transport combatants or for other military purposes        Controversial tactics allegedly used by Israel Collective punishment The United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict found that Israel  at least in part  targeted the people of Gaza as a whole  The Mission gave its opinion that  the operations were in furtherance of an overall policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population for its resilience and for its apparent support for Hamas  and possibly with the intent of forcing a change in such support        Judge Goldstone later at least partially resiled from this conclusion   Disproportionate force Israel was widely criticised by human rights groups for using heavy firepower and causing hundreds of civilian casualties       A group of soldiers who took part in the conflict echoed the criticism through both the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence and a special report by Israeli filmmaker Nurit Kedar that was shown on Britain s Channel   in January                 Israel was accused of having a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population       Israel has said that operational orders emphasised proportionality and humanity while the importance of minimising harm to civilians was made clear to soldiers       Retired U S  Army colonel Douglas Macgregor gave his opinion as   They went in heavy  with lots of firepower  But at the same time  because of good intel and other improvements  they were able to be selective and cut down on collateral damage         IDF use of human shields On    March  a report from the UN team responsible for the protection of children in war zones was released  it found  hundreds  of violations of the rights of children and accused Israeli soldiers of using children as human shields  bulldozing a home with a woman and child still inside  and shelling a building they had ordered civilians into a day earlier       One case involved using an    year old boy as a human shield  by forcing him to enter suspected buildings first and also inspect bags  The report also mentioned the boy was used as a shield when Israeli soldiers came under fire            The Guardian has also received testimony from three Palestinian brothers aged         and     who all claimed to have been used as human shields       The UK newspaper The Guardian conducted an investigation of its own  which  according to the paper  uncovered evidence of war crimes including the use of Palestinian children as human shields       An Israeli military court later convicted two Israeli soldiers of using human shields       which was outlawed by the Israeli Supreme court in            The UN fact finding mission investigated four incidents in which Palestinian civilians were coerced  blindfolded  handcuffed and at gunpoint to enter houses ahead of Israeli soldiers during military operations  The mission confirmed the continued use of this practice with published testimonies of Israeli soldiers who had taken part in the military operations  The mission concluded that these practices amounted to using civilians as human shields in breach of international law  Some civilians were also questioned under threat of death or injury to extract information about Palestinian combatants and tunnels  constituting a further violation of international humanitarian law       White phosphorus From   January  reports emerged of use by Israel of white phosphorus during the offensive  which was initially denied by Israel       There were numerous reports of its use by the IDF during the conflict  On    January  it was reported that more than    phosphorus burns victims were in Nasser Hospital  On    January the UNRWA headquarters was hit with phosphorus munitions       As a result of the hit  the compound was set ablaze       On completion of the three day Israeli withdrawal     January  an Israeli military spokeswoman said that shells containing phosphorus had been used in Gaza but said that they were used legally as a method to provide a smokescreen       The IDF reiterated their position on    January saying that it used weapons  in compliance with international law  while strictly observing that they be used according to the type of combat and its characteristics        On    March       the United States based human rights organization Human Rights Watch published a    page report titled  Rain of Fire  Israel s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza  and said that Israel s usage of the weapon was illegal       Donatella Rovera  Amnesty s researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories said that such extensive use of this weapon in Gaza s densely populated residential neighbourhoods is inherently indiscriminate   Its repeated use in this manner  despite evidence of its indiscriminate effects and its toll on civilians  is a war crime   she said       The Goldstone report accepted that white phosphorus is not illegal under international law but did find that the Israelis were  systematically reckless in determining its use in built up areas   It also called for serious consideration to be given to the banning of its use as an obscurant        Play media Al Jazeera video  Burning Israeli white phosphorus clusters in the streets of Gaza on    January      Videos by Al Jazeera of the           Gaza War After watching footage of Israeli troop deployments on television  a British soldier who completed numerous combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Intelligence Corps defended the Israeli Army s use of white phosphorus  The soldier noted   White phosphorus is used because it provides an instant smokescreen  other munitions can provide a smokescreen but the effect is not instant  Faced with overwhelming enemy fire and wounded comrades  every commander would choose to screen his men instantly  to do otherwise would be negligent        Colonel Lane  a military expert testifying in front of the fact finding mission in July       told that white phosphorus is used for smoke generation to hide from the enemy  He stated   The quality of smoke produced by white phosphorus is superb  if you want real smoke for real coverage  white phosphorus will give it to you        Professor Newton  expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of the committee  said that in an urban area  where potential perils are snipers  explosive devices and trip wires  one effective way to mask forces  movement is by white phosphorus  In certain cases  he added  such choice of means would be less harmful for civilian population than other munitions  provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test  In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case by case basis taking into account  the precise circumstances of its use  not in general  generically  but based on that target  at that time   He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area  He also said that in his view white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon and is not intended to cause damage  He said its use was not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention       An article by Mark Cantora examining the legal implications of the use of white phosphorus munitions by the IDF  published in      in the Gonzaga Journal of International Law  argues that Israel s use of white phosphorus in Gaza was technically legal under existing international humanitarian laws and  Therefore  it is imperative for the international community to convene a White Phosphorus Convention Conference in order to address these issues and fill this substantial gap in international humanitarian law         Dense inert metal explosives  DIME  Dense Inert Metal Explosive  DIME  is a type of bomb developed to minimize collateral damage       Casualties show unusual injuries  A military expert working for Human Rights Watch said judging by the nature of the wounds and descriptions given by Gazans made it seem likely that Israel used DIME weapons  A Norwegian doctor who worked at Gaza s Shifa Hospital said that pressure waves generated by missile hits are likely the cause and produced by DIME weapons       Another Norwegian doctor said they had  clear evidence that the Israelis are using a new type of very high explosive weapons which are called Dense Inert Metal Explosive        Colonel Lane  military expert testifying in front of the fact finding mission in July       told the committee that through his studies  no actual proof was found that DIME rounds were used  but tungsten  iron  and sulfur were found in samples analyzed in a forensic lab  He is of the view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component to reduce the effect on the ground  Colonel Lane explained that the idea behind a Focused Lethality Munition  FLM   which is an example of a DIME munition  is that the fragments produced stay within a safety radius of about   meters  so anybody outside that radius is safe  while those within the area of dispersal will be affected severely  He commented on the documentations where medics described unusual amputations saying that he was no medical expert  but the use of a metal like tungsten and cobalt at short distances would likely have that effect       The Goldstone Report wrote that the Mission found that the allegations that DIME weapons were used by Israeli armed forces required further clarification and they were unable to ascertain their usage  though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact  It stated that the  focused lethality  reportedly pursued in DIME weapons could be seen as enhancing compliance with the principle of distinction between civilian and military objects  The report added that as it currently stands  DIME weapons and weapons armed with heavy metal are not prohibited under international law  but do raise specific health concerns       An Amnesty International report called on Israel to confirm or deny its use of DIME in order to facilitate the treatment of those injured in the conflict       After reports of similar cases in       the IDF had denied the use of DIME weapons       After Israeli forces fired shells near a UN school in Gaza killing around    people  Israel s military said the shelling was in response to mortar fire from within the school and asserted that Hamas were using civilians as cover  They stated that the dead near the school included Hamas members of a rocket launching cell  Two residents of the area confirmed that a group of militants were firing mortar shells from near the school and identified two of the victims as Hamas militants   Accusations of misconduct by IDF soldiers Testimonies from Israeli soldiers allegedly admitting indiscriminate killings of civilians  as well as vandalizing homes  were reported in March                      Soon after the publication of the testimonies  reports implying that the testimonies were based on hearsay and not on the firsthand experience started to circulate       At the same time  another kind of evidence was collected from several soldiers who took part in the fighting  that rebutted claims of immoral conduct on the military s part during Gaza War       Following investigations  the IDF issued an official report  concluding that alleged cases of deliberate shooting at civilians did not take place       Nine Israeli rights groups reacting to the closure of the investigation issued a joint statement calling for an  independent nonpartisan investigative body to be established to look into all Israeli army activity  in Gaza       In July       the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence published testimony from    soldiers  two junior officers and the rest enlisted personnel  who took part in the Gaza assault  claiming that the IDF used Gazans as human shields  improperly fired incendiary white phosphorus shells over civilian areas and used overwhelming firepower that caused needless deaths and destruction            The report did not represent a cross section of the army  but rather they were troops who had approached the group or were reached through acquaintances of NGO members       The accusations were made by anonymous people who claimed that they were reserves soldiers and whose faces had been blurred in the filmed talks  An Israeli military spokesperson dismissed the testimonies as anonymous hearsay and questioned why Breaking the Silence had not handed over its findings before the media had been informed  The Israeli military said some allegations of misconduct had turned out to be second or third hand accounts and the result of recycled rumours            Breaking the Silence state that their methodology includes the verification of all information by cross referencing the testimonies it collects and that published material has been confirmed by a number of testimonies  from several different points of view  A representative stated  the personal details of the soldiers quoted in the collection  and the exact location of the incidents described in the testimonies  would readily be made available to any official and independent investigation of the events  as long as the identity of the testifiers did not become public        A soldier who described using Gazans as human shields told in an interview to Haaretz that he had not seen Palestinians being used as human shields but had been told by his commanders that this occurred       In response to the report  a dozen English speaking reservists who served in Gaza delivered signed  on camera counter testimonies via the SoldiersSpeakOut group  about Hamas   use of Gazans as human shields and the measures the IDF took to protect Arab civilians             The special report by Israeli filmmaker Nurit Kedar shown on Channel   detailed similar allegations by former IDF soldiers that included vandalism and misconduct by Israeli troops       Colonel Richard Kemp  former commander of British forces in Afghanistan  in his address to the UNHRC asserted that during the conflict  the Israel Defense Forces  did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare  and that Palestinian civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas  way of fighting  which involved using human shields as a matter of policy  and deliberate attempts to sacrifice their own civilians  He added that Israel took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas and aborted potentially effective missions in order to prevent civilian casualties        Prosecutions The first Israeli soldier to be prosecuted for actions committed during the war was a Givati Brigade soldier who stole a Visa credit card from a Palestinian home and used it to withdraw NIS               He was arrested and tried before the Southern Command Military Court on charges of looting  credit card fraud  and indecent conduct  He was found guilty and sentenced to seven and a half months in military prison       In a report submitted to the UN in January       the IDF stated that two senior officers were disciplined for authorizing an artillery attack in violation of rules against their near populated areas  Several artillery shells hit the UNRWA compound in Tel al Hawa            During the attack on    January       the compound was set ablaze by white phosphorus shells       The officers involved were identified as Gaza Division Commander Brigadier General Eyal Eisenberg and Givati Brigade Commander Colonel Ilan Malka       An IDF internal investigation concluded that the firing of the shells violated the IDF orders limiting the use of artillery fire near populated areas and endangered human life       IDF sources added later that the shells had been fired to create cover to assist in the extrication of IDF troops  some of whom were wounded  from an area where Hamas held a superior position       An Israeli Government spokesman stated that in this particular case they had found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and so had not referred the case to criminal investigation       In October       Colonel Ilan Malka was interrogated by Israeli military police over the Zeitoun incident  and a criminal investigation was opened  Malka was suspected of authorizing an airstrike on a building that left numerous members of the Samouni family dead  His promotion to the rank of Brigadier General was suspended due to the investigation  Malka told investigatiors that he was unaware of the presence of civilians           He was eventually reprimanded over the incident  but it was decided not to indict him  No other charges were brought over this incident  The IDF denied that they were targeting civilians and The New York Times reported that Hamas members had launched rockets at Israel about a mile away from the residents  an area  known to have many supporters of Hamas        The Palestinian Center for Human Rights called the result  disgraceful  and Btselem stated the need for an external investigator to look into IDF actions during Cast Lead       In June       Chief Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit summoned a recently discharged Givati Brigade sniper for a special hearing  The soldier was suspected of opening fire on Palestinian civilians when a group of    Palestinians that included women and children waving a white flag  approached an IDF position  The incident  which occurred on   January       resulted in the death of a non combatant  Mandelblit decided to indict the soldier on a charge of manslaughter  despite contradictory testimony and the fact that IDF investigators could not confirm that the soldier was responsible for the death       In July       the officer who authorized the airstrike on the Ibrahim al Maqadna Mosque was subjected to disciplinary action  as shrapnel caused  unintentional injuries  to civilians inside  The IDF said that the officer  failed to exercise appropriate judgement   and that he would not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command in the future  Another Israeli officer was also reprimanded for allowing a Palestinian man to enter a building to persuade Hamas militants sheltering inside to leave       In November       two Givati Brigade Staff Sergeants were convicted by the Southern Command Military Court of using a Palestinian boy as a human shield  The soldiers had been accused of forcing nine year old Majed R  at gunpoint to open bags suspected of containing bombs in the Tel al Hawa neighborhood  Both soldiers were demoted one rank and given three month suspended sentences      According to the U S  State Department s      Human Rights Report  the Military Advocate General investigated over     wartime incidents  including those mentioned in the Goldstone Report  As of July  the Military Advocate General launched    criminal investigations into the conduct of IDF personnel  and completed a significant number of those       On   April       Judge Richard Goldstone  the lead author of the UN report on the conflict  published a piece in The Washington Post titled  Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes   Goldstone noted that the subsequent investigations conducted by Israel  indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy  while  the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying   He further expressed regret  that our fact finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted  because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes        The other principal authors of the UN report  Hina Jilani  Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers  have rejected Goldstone s reassessment arguing that there is  no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context  findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict            Effects Main article  Effects of the Gaza War  Destroyed buildings in Gaza City  January      Along with a high casualty rate  there were multiple economic  industrial and medical effects of the Gaza War  The United Nations Development Programme warned that there will be long term consequences of the attacks on Gaza because the livelihoods and assets of tens of thousands of Gaza civilians have been affected       Early estimates by independent contractors in Gaza say that Gaza lost nearly    billion in assets  including       homes destroyed       The IDF destroyed         factories  small industries  workshops and business enterprises throughout the Gaza Strip          mosques     security compounds  and    water or sewage lines       The World Health Organization said that    health facilities    hospitals and    primary health care clinics  were damaged over the course of the offensive and the UNOCHA said that over    United Nations facilities sustained damage  of which    reported damage in the first three days of the operation       On    January       Israel paid       million in compensation to the United Nations for damages to UN property incurred during the Israeli offensive       A satellite based damage assessment of the Gaza Strip by the United Nations revealed       destroyed and severely damaged buildings      impact craters on roads and bridges with an estimated length of     km      mi  of paved and unpaved roads damaged      impact craters on open ground or cultivated land with an estimated land area of       hectares     km        greenhouses completely destroyed or severely damaged with an estimated area of    hectares       km    and       hectares        km   of demolished zones targeted by IDF bulldozers  tanks and phosphorus shelling        Health problems in Gaza Following the war  Gaza has witnessed increasing epidemics of health problems  At the Al Shifa hospital a constant increase in the percentage of children born with birth defects of about     was witnessed when the period of July to September      was compared to the same period in                 Dr  Mohammed Abu Shaban  director of the Blood Tumors Department in Al Rantisy Hospital in Gaza has witnessed an increase in the number of cases of blood cancer  In March      the department had seen    cases so far for that year  compared to the    to    cases normally seen in an entire year       During the war  Norwegian medics said that they had found traces of depleted uranium  a radioactive and genotoxic material used in some types of munition  in some Gaza residents who were wounded            Lawyers who brought back soil samples from Gaza said that areas where these samples were taken contained up to    tons of depleted uranium       The Israeli government denied it used Depleted Uranium  and the United Nations opened an investigation       Israel had also initially denied the use of white phosphorus during the war  but later acknowledged that indeed it had used white phosphorus to cover troop movements       The policy of the Government of Israel is to condition the access of Palestinians who live in the Palestinian territories to healthcare in Israel upon financial coverage from the Palestinian Authority  In January       following the war  the Palestinian Authority cancelled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals  including coverage for chronically ill Palestinian patients  and those in need of complex care that is not available in other tertiary medical centers in the region  This decision was protested by human rights organizations        Gaza humanitarian crisis See also            Gaza Strip aid  A satellite based damage assessment of the Gaza Strip by the United Nations  UNOSAT   February      The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that the Gaza humanitarian crisis is significant and should not be understated  It also states that the situation is a  human dignity crisis  in the Gaza strip  entailing  a massive destruction of livelihoods and a significant deterioration of infrastructure and basic services   Fear and panic are widespread      of the population could not support themselves and were dependent on humanitarian assistance     The International Red Cross said the situation was  intolerable  and a  full blown humanitarian crisis        The importation of necessary food and supplies continues to be blocked even after the respective ceasefires       According to the World Food Programme  the UN s Food and Agriculture Organization and Palestinian officials  between     and     of the agriculture industry was wrecked  With extensive damage occurring to water sources  greenhouses  and farmland  It is estimated that     of the agricultural land in the north of the Strip may no longer be arable            More than        Gazans were left homeless       Extensive destruction was caused to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure  According to Palestinian industrialists      factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation  They accounted as part of the    of industrial capacity that was operating after the Israeli blockade was imposed  which was mostly destroyed during the operation       On   January before the IDF ground operation  Israel s foreign minister Tzipi Livni said that Israel had taken care to protect the civilian population of Gaza  and that it had kept the humanitarian situation  completely as it should be   maintaining Israel s earlier stance       The Secretary general of the Arab League  Amr Moussa  criticized Livni s statement and further criticized the Security Council for not responding faster to the crisis       On subsequent reports  the UN stated that  only an immediate cease fire will be able to address the large scale humanitarian and protection crisis that faces the people of Gaza        The Emergency Relief Coordinator of the United Nations has stated that after the end of the Israeli operation  at best  only     truckloads get into Gaza  instead of the normal daily requirement  including commercial traffic  of     trucks at minimum  It is also reported in his statement and other UN humanitarian office reports that essential items such as construction materials  water pipes  electrical wires  and transformers continue to be effectively banned  or only allowed infrequently                      He also stated that commercial goods must be allowed in and out  since Gaza Palestinians  do not want or deserve to be dependent on humanitarian aid  and that the  limited trickle  of items into Gaza continue the effective collective punishment of the civilian population and force the counter productive reliance on tunnels for daily essentials              Tent camp  Gaza Strip  April      As a result of the conflict  the European Union  the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and over    nations donated humanitarian aid to Gaza  including the United States  which donated over     million       On   January a UN Relief Works Agency spokesman acknowledged that he was  aware of instances where deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza  were diverted by the Hamas government  though never from his agency       Additionally  on   February  blankets and food parcels were confiscated by Hamas police personnel from an UNRWA distribution center  and on   February  the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator demanded that the aid be returned immediately       The Hamas government issued a statement stating that the incident was a misunderstanding between the drivers of the trucks and has been resolved through direct contact with the UNRWA       On   February  UNRWA lifted the suspension on the movement of its humanitarian supplies into Gaza  after the Hamas authorities returned all the aid supplies confiscated       The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has described the Israeli procedures for humanitarian organizations entrance to Gaza as inconsistent and unpredictable ones that impedes the ability of organizations to effectively plan their humanitarian response and obstructs efforts to address the humanitarian crisis brought by the    months blockade and Israel s military operation       The UN also reported that international organizations faced  unprecedented denial  of access to Gaza by Israel since   November and that humanitarian access remained unreliable and needed to be granted on an unrestricted daily basis  clarification needed         Destroyed buildings in Gaza In a damage assessment by the World Health Organization      of the     health facilities assessed were found to be damaged or destroyed     of Gaza s    hospitals and    primary health care centers suffered damage  and    ambulances were partially damaged or destroyed       Injured patients needing referral outside Gaza for specialized care were evacuated exclusively through the Egyptian Rafah border crossing  In the early stages of the conflict  Hamas sealed the border  and prevented wounded Palestinians from seeking medical attention in Egypt       On    December  the organization allowed a trickle of medical evacuations from Gaza  but restricted their number       Gaza Ministry of Health reported that between    December and    January     injured were evacuated through Rafah  The Israeli Erez crossing was closed much of the period and only    patients were able to exit during the crisis            An initial survey conducted by the United Nations Development Programme  UNDP  estimates that        homes     government buildings  and    non governmental organization offices  NGOs  were either totally or partially damaged  creating about         tonnes of concrete rubble needing to be removed       Since       Israel has not permitted the entry of construction material into Gaza  adversely affecting UN projects  in particular UNRWA and UNDP  who suspended more than      million in construction projects due to lack of materials       The Israeli Health Ministry and Magen David Adom established an emergency clinic for wounded Gazans at the Erez crossing on    June  The clinic received only quantify patients  none of them with war related injuries  and it was suspected that Hamas had instructed civilians not to seek treatment there  The clinic closed after ten days       Subsequently  the Jordanian Army established a field hospital in the Gaza Strip  which is still operating  when   The hospital s equipment  staff  and military guards are transferred from Jordan through Israel via the Allenby Bridge  and outgoing personnel return the same way            One year after the ceasefire approximately        people remained displaced        Effects on Israel  According to HRW  during the Gaza War  rocket attacks placed up to         people within range of attack       During the conflict  life in much of southern Israel was largely paralyzed by more than    Hamas rocket and mortar strikes       The Israeli Home Front Command issued detailed emergency instructions to Israeli citizens for preparing for and dealing with rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip  The instructions included orders to stay within a certain distance of bomb shelters based on proximity to the source of the rockets       Hamas  Grad rockets  increased range of    km put more than         Israelis within strike range       prompting     of the residents of the southern city of Ashkelon to flee the city  despite official calls to stay       Throughout the war  Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel damaged or destroyed more than       homes and buildings and     vehicles       Numerous agricultural fields near Gaza also sustained damage  Twenty eight Israeli families lost their homes to rocket attacks  and had to temporarily live in hotels       Among the buildings hit were nine educational facilities and three synagogues       Schools and universities in southern Israel began to close due to rocket threats on    December       Studies officially resumed on    January  Only schools with fortified classrooms and bomb shelters were allowed to bring students in  and IDF Home Front Command representatives were stationed in the schools            attendance was low                 Palestinian rocket attacks that hit educational facilities caused no casualties                      The largest hospital on Israel s southern coast  Ashkelon s Barzilai Medical Center  moved its critical treatment facilities into an underground shelter after a rocket struck beside its helicopter pad on    December       Most business in Southern Israel stopped upon orders of the Home Front Command  with retailers losing an estimated    million in the first week  Numerous small businesses suffered in decreased sales  and were unable to pay employee salaries due to low revenues       Major industries remained open  but had high absence rates       The Manufacturers Association of Israel estimated the direct cost to business and industry to be    million NIS  and indirect financial losses at several tens of millions of shekels       The Israel Tax Authority received       compensation claims for damages related to the conflict  mostly from Ashkelon and Ashdod       According to Israeli economist Ron Eichel  the war effort cost the Israeli military about   billion NIS in military expenditure  or     million NIS per day       An anonymous political source told Ynetnews that the aerial assaults were costing     million to     million a day in munitions and fuel  totaling the first six days of the operation at nearly      million for air strikes alone  Both the IDF and Treasury refused to disclose the exact amount  and the Treasury adamantly denied these figures        International law Main article  International law and the Gaza War See also  United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict Accusations of violations regarding international humanitarian law  which governs the actions by belligerents during an armed conflict  have been directed at both Israel and Hamas for their actions during the Gaza War  The accusations covered violating laws governing distinction and proportionality by Israel  the indiscriminate firing of rockets at civilian locations and extrajudicial violence within the Gaza Strip by Hamas           As of September       some     complaints had been filed by individuals and NGOs at the prosecutor s office in the Hague calling for investigations into alleged crimes committed by Israel during the Gaza War       On    September       a     page report by UN inquiry team was released  officially titled  Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories  Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict   It concluded that the Israel Defense Forces  IDF  and Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity       On    October       the UN Human Rights Council endorsed the report       Israel s Defense Minister said that the report was distorted  falsified and not balanced       Human rights organizations have urged both Israel and Hamas to implement an independent investigation into the alleged violations of international law as stipulated by the Goldstone report                 On   April       Goldstone wrote an op ed that appeared in The Washington Post in which he stated that he no longer believes the report s finding that Israel targeted Palestinian civilians as a matter of policy  the most serious accusation the report made against Israel       The three other signatories to the UNHRC report  Hina Jilani  Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers  co authored an op ed that appeared in The Guardian in which they replied that there was no evidence that refutes any of the report s findings       In April       the International Criminal Court  ICC  rejected the Palestinian Authority s  PA  request that Israel be investigated for claimed war crimes in Gaza in       holding that since the PA is recognized by the UN General Assembly as an  observer  rather than a  state   the ICC lacked jurisdiction to hear its request            The decision was heavily criticized by human rights groups        Media Main article  Media and the Gaza War  Photojournalists during the conflict International news networks named the conflict  War in Gaza  and focused on the assault  Israeli media called it the  War in the South   Hebrew               Mil ama BaDarom  and dispatched reporters to Israeli towns hit by rockets       Al Jazeera suggested that it was a war against Palestinian civilians with the title  War on Gaza         Denied media access Reporter access to the war zone was limited  During the Gaza raids against Hamas  the Israeli army denied international media access to the conflict zone  against a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court to lift the embargo       The Foreign Press Association of Israel released a statement saying   The unprecedented denial of access to Gaza for the world s media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of Israel in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs         Attacks on the media Media facilities in Gaza  both foreign and domestic  came under Israeli fire in the military campaign       On one occasion a Grad rocket may have been launched from a location near the television studios in the Al Shuruk tower in Gaza City  Although the Israeli recording of a reporter describing a rocket launch was during the initial aerial bombardment phase the tower was only bombed in the final few days       On    December the IDF destroyed the facilities and headquarters of Al Aqsa TV  though broadcasts continue from elsewhere   and a week later  IDF soldiers entered the building and seized the equipment  The Israelis also hacked into the station s signal and broadcast an animated clip of Hamas  leadership being gunned down  On   January the IDF bombed the offices of the Hamas affiliated Al Risala newsweekly       On   January the IDF hit the Johara tower of Gaza City  which houses more than    international news organizations  including Turkish  French  and Iranian outlets       The IDF Spokesperson s Unit said that the building had not been targeted  though it may have sustained damage from a nearby Israeli strike  On    January two Arab journalists from Jerusalem working for an Iranian television station were arrested by Israeli Police and indicted in the Jerusalem District Court for violating military censorship protocols  They had reported on the IDF ground offensive hours before they were cleared to do so  The journalists maintained that they merely stated what was already being said in the international media        New media Media relations also played an important role  with the use of new media  up to and including cyber warfare  on the part of both Israel and Hamas       Haaretz reported that Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni  instructed senior ministry officials to open an aggressive and diplomatic international public relations campaign to gain support for Israel Defense Forces operations in the Gaza Strip

against the war in London  UK  While Israel defined its operation as a war against Hamas  Palestinian representatives and individuals  among others  viewed it as a  war on the Palestinian people                  The United Nations Security Council issued a statement on    December       calling  for an immediate halt to all violence        The Arab League       the European Union and many nations made similar calls       On   January       following an earlier  failed attempt at a ceasefire resolution       the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution      calling for  an immediate  durable and fully respected cease fire  leading to a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to Gaza arms smuggling  by    votes to one abstention  the United States        The resolution was ignored by both Israel and Hamas         Governmental proclamations regarding the           Israel Gaza conflict   Israel Gaza   States that endorsed the Israeli position defined Israel s action as falling

Venezuela significantly downscaled or severed their relations with Israel in protest of the offensive            The conflict saw worldwide civilian demonstrations for and against both sides       The conflict triggered a wave of reprisal attacks against Jewish targets in Europe and elsewhere       The worldwide number of recorded antisemitic incidents during the conflict more than tripled the number of such incidents in the same period of the previous year  marking a two decade high       The British government reviewed its export licenses to Israel for violations of EU and national arms export control laws and revoked five export licenses for replacement parts and other equipment for Sa ar     missile boats used by Israel because they were used in the Gaza offensive  although    export licenses for other British defense items to Israel were approved       The conflict has been called the Gaza Massacre  Arabic              in the Arab world                 Khaled Mashal  Hamas  leader in Damascus called for suicide bombings  Ismail Haniyeh  Prime Minister of the Hamas government in Gaza  said   Palestine has never witnessed an uglier massacre        On    December       a Palestinian laborer working in the Israeli settlement of Modi in Illit struck his supervisor on the head with a sledgehammer  stabbed and injured four civilians  and beat up several others  He was shot and severely wounded by an emergency response team member as he attempted to flee  His actions were suspected of being a reprisal for Israel s attack  The worker had been employed in the city for about    years with no previous trouble  but had spoken out against the war shortly before his rampage        Reactions in Israel  Tel Aviv University students demonstrate in support for operation  Cast Lead  and the citizens of south Israel  The war provoked mixed reactions inside Israel  with the Jewish majority largely supporting it  and the Arab minority mostly opposing it  A poll taken on   January      showed that     of the Jewish public supported the war  and    opposed it  while a separate poll conducted     January showed a     approval of the war among Jews and     disapproval among Israeli Arabs       During the war  Arab protests took place across the country  Within hours of the war s start  the Higher Follow Up Committee for Arab citizens of Israel met in Nazareth  and declared a  day of wrath and mourning for the martyrs among our compatriots in the Gaza Strip   and a general strike for the following day  Arab demonstrations took place across the country almost every day during the offensive  and were described as the  largest Arab demonstrations in Israel s history   Arab parties and parliamentarians in the Knesset also opposed the offensive            In Jerusalem  Arabs held violent demonstrations  which included rock throwing  arson  and the vandalization of Jewish graves  Police arrested dozens of rioters  At the University of Haifa  Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Jewish leftist and Arab students staged anti war demonstrations  which were met with pro war counter demonstrations  Some confrontations occurred despite police keeping protesters apart       The legal rights agency Adalah produced a report highly critical of the Israeli police and court system s response to the opposition to Operation Cast Lead  The report said that the Israeli authorities had shown a lack of tolerance for protests  and had damaged the freedom of expression of those opposing the attacks on Gaza  The report said that the actions showed the lessons of the Or Commission had not been learned  The Israeli Ministry of Justice responded that the risk to human life and public welfare had justified their actions       The term Sderot cinema has been coined for the tradition of residents in Sderot sitting to view the bombardment of the Gaza strip   See also   Palestine portal Israel portal      Israel Hamas ceasefire

December        A period of relative quiet between    June and   November  As of    June  there was a marked reduction in the extent of attacks on the western Negev population  The lull was sporadically violated by rocket and mortar shell fire  carried out by rogue terrorist organizations  in some instances in defiance of Hamas  especially by Fatah and Al Qaeda supporters   Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire     The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement    November to the time of this writing  December      On   November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas  which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose  Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action  In retaliation  Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets     During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm  Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks  rocket and mortar shell fire  IEDs and light arms fire   the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip  Israeli Air Force attacks  firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border   the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire  in response to which Israel closed the border crossings  exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents     With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on   November  Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods  That led to shortages of basic goods in the Gaza Strip and to disruptions in the supply of various types of fuel  although electrical power was not cut off  since the plant in Ashqelon  which supplies     of the Gaza Strip s electricity  provided an uninterrupted flow of power

motives behind the latest Israeli attack on Gaza lie elsewhere      in the need to restore Israel s  deterrence capacity   and     in the threat posed by a new Palestinian  peace offensive      Israel s  larger concern  in the current offensive  New York Times Middle East correspondent Ethan Bronner reported  quoting Israeli sources  was to  re establish Israeli deterrence   because  its enemies are less afraid of it than they once were  or should be   Preserving its deterrence capacity has always loomed large in Israeli strategic doctrine      It is impossible to claim that those who decided to blow up the tunnel were simply being thoughtless  The military establishment was aware of the immediate implications of the measure  as well as of the fact that the policy of  controlled entry  into a narrow area of the Strip leads to the same place  an end to the lull  That is policy not a tactical decision by a commander on the ground     Noam Chomsky           Exterminate all the Brutes
