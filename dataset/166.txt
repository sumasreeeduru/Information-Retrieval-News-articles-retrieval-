service television station based in Auckland  New Zealand  Since August        It broadcasts on the Sky Network as of December      ASO  Previously  Triangle has broadcast across Auckland on analogue UHF  before December      ASO  via a government owned UHF channel reserved for non commercial regional television from transmitters at Waiatarua  Pinehill and Remuera  The station is owned by a not for profit trust  Airtime is leased out to volunteer and professional programme providers on a first come  first served basis  Providers are allowed to air a limited number of commercials  a maximum of   minutes per half hour of broadcast  during their programmes  and have complete editorial control over content  The trust claims these rules mean it  cannot be controlled by individuals or groups with their own agendas      Triangle also operated Stratos Television between      and       It was broadcast around New Zealand on the Freeview  Sky and TelstraClear cable digital platforms  This was a free to air  twenty four hour  nationwide news and culture public broadcasting service  It was shut down on    December      due to funding complications  because as the channel grew in viewership so did its ratings share and since Freeview carriage charges are ratings based there was a number of increases to fees Triangle as paying to the Kordia operated Freeview service  As of November          Sky offered Triangle an undisclosed deal to re launch Stratos under the name Face TV      The service was launched on February         and is currently Triangle s only digital option due to the current National led government s lack of support to regional public broadcasters   The service  unlike Stratos  simulcast the current Triangle schedule with national advertising options    Using an IP link provided by government owned Kordia and a government owned non commercial UHF channel due to expire in December       Triangle Television also broadcast a similar station across Wellington  operated out of Auckland  from    August      to    March       The channels shared transmission facilities and resources  and broadcast many of the same news  regional  and cultural programming
