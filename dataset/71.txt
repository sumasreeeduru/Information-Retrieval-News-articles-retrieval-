also known as physical trauma  is damage to the body caused by external force     This may be caused by accidents  falls  hits  weapons  and other causes     Major trauma is injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death  In           million people world wide died from injuries  up from     million in          More than     of these deaths were transport related injuries     In               children under the age of five died from injuries  down from         in          Injuries are the cause of    of all deaths  and are the sixth leading cause of death in

Injury  ICECI   Under this system  injuries are classified by   mechanism of injury  objects substances producing injury  place of occurrence  activity when injured  the role of human intent  and additional modules  These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on causes and preventive efforts        The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System  OIICS   Under this system injuries are classified by  nature  part of body affected  source and secondary source  and event or exposure  The OIICS was first published in      and has been updated several times since     The Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System  OSIICS   previously OSICS  is used to classify injuries to enable research into specific sports injuries          By cause edit  Causes for injuries fall under two categories  intentional and accidental  Intentional injuries include acts of violence and war  or be self imposed like suicide or self harm  Accidental injuries can come from falling or motor vehicle accidents      Some cases of accidental injuries are injury by stingray or lightning injuries  By modality edit  Trauma Traumatic injuries are a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical collision or movement  Injuries associated with trauma are avulsion  bone fracture  injury by blast  internal bleeding and catastrophic injuries  Strain  repetitive strain  or sprain Strain and repetitive strain are injuries to muscles or tendons  Sprain is an injury to a ligament or ligaments      Toxins Injury from toxin or as adverse effect of a pharmaceutical drug  Other external or internal injuries Other injuries can be from external causes  such as radiation  burn or frostbite  These injuries can include radiation induced lung injury and microwave burn  Injuries from internal causes include reperfusion injury  By location edit  Skin   Wound  an injury in which skin is torn  cut or punctured  an open wound   or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion  a closed wound   In pathology  it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin  Head   Head injury Penetrating head injury Closed head injury Eyes   Eye injury Chemical eye injury Eye injuries during general anaesthesia Brain

Illness and injuries during spaceflight Injury severity score edit  The injury severity score  ISS  is a medical score to assess trauma severity          It correlates with mortality  morbidity  and hospitalization time after trauma  It is used to define the term major trauma  polytrauma   recognized when the ISS is greater than         The AIS Committee of the Association for the Advancement of
