transcription into French is Beyrouth  which was sometimes used during Lebanon s French occupation  The Arabic name derives from Phoenician Berot or Birut       Brt   This was a modification of the Canaanite and Phoenician word be rot  meaning  the wells   in reference to the site s accessible water table          The name is first attested in the   th century BC  when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform     tablets of the Amarna letters      letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta     to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt      Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib Hadda of Byblos      The Greeks hellenised the name as B ryt s  Ancient Greek            which the Romans latinised as Berytus  a  When it attained the status of a Roman colony  it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors   Prehistory edit   Canaanean Blade  Suggested to be part of a javelin  Fresh grey flint  both sides showing pressure flaking  Somewhat narrower at the base  suggesting a haft  Polished at the extreme point  Found on land of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut  Prehistory edit  Beirut was settled more than       years ago     and the area had been inhabited for far longer  Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut  revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age  Beirut I  Minet el Hosn  was listed as  the town of Beirut   French  Beyrouth ville  by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Fran ais in central Beirut          The site was discovered by Lortet in      and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in           The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon      Beirut II  Umm el Khatib  was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh  where P E  Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around     metres      feet  above sea level  The site had been built on and destroyed by           Beirut III  Furn esh Shebbak   listed as Plateau Tabet  was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River  Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road  although this determination has been criticised by Lorraine Copeland      P  E  Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle  Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site  which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area      Beirut IV  Furn esh Shebbak  river banks  was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits  The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces  The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen      Raoul Describes     and Auguste Bergy      Collections from the site were made by Bergy  Describes and another Jesuit  Paul Bovier Lapierre  Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river  They included around    varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period  some with a lustrous sheen  now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory  Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site  which has now disappeared beneath buildings  Beirut V  Nahr Beirut  Beirut River  was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river  near the river mouth  and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli  Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits      The area has now been built on      Beirut VI  Patriarchate  was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut  It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library      Beirut VII  the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area  are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in      and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah  One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls  pits  floors  charcoal  pottery and flints  The other  overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema  was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock  Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil  above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil  Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer      Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area  and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area       History edit  See also  Timeline of Beirut The oldest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the river that  but the channel became silted up and it joined it to the mainland  Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician  Hellenistic  Roman  Byzantine  Arab  Crusader  and Ottoman remains       Phoenician period edit  Main article  Phoenician port of Beirut The Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast  The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city      Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around   kilometre       miles  to the west in      by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University  Controversy arose on    June      when authorisation was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins  archaeological site BEY     in the      million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut  Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun  including Hanz Curver  and an expert report by Ralph Pederson  a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in Marburg  Germany  dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port  on various criteria  The exact function of site BEY    may never be known  and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press               Hellenistic period edit  In     BC  the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon in his conflict with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy  Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan  Present day Beirut overlies this ancient one  and little archaeology was carried out until after the civil war       The salvage excavations after      have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut s history  Public architecture included several areas and buildings      Mid  st century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche  goddess of fortune      on the reverse  the city s symbol appears  a dolphin entwines an anchor  This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in   th century Venice  After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced  King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control  However  after the Battle of Tigranocerta  Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general Pompey   Roman period edit   Roman Columns of Basilica near the Forum of Berytus Main article  Berytus Laodicea was conquered by Pompey in    BC and the name Berytus was restored to it  The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire  soldiers were sent there  and large building projects were undertaken              From the  st century BC  the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself  Under Claudius  Berytus expanded to reach the Bekaa Valley and include Heliopolis  Baalbek   The city was settled by Roman colonists who promoted agriculture in the region  As a result of this settlement  the city quickly became Romanized  and the city became the only mainly Latin speaking area in the Syria Phoenicia province       In    BC  during the reign of Herod the Great  Berytus became a colony  one of four in the Syria Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights  ius Italicum  exempting its citizens from imperial taxation  Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire      Furthermore  the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus  the  th Macedonian and the  rd Gallic Legions      Berytus s law school was widely known      two of Rome s most famous jurists  Papinian and Ulpian  were natives of Phoenicia and taught there under the Severan emperors  When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the  th century  a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists  and in AD     Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire  In      a major earthquake struck Berytus              causing widespread damage  The earthquake reduced cities along the coast to ruins and killed many         in Berytus alone by some measurements      As a result  the students of the law school were transferred to Sidon      Salvage excavations since      have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus  Public architecture included several bath complexes  Colonnaded Streets  a circus and theatre      residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness  Martyrs  Square and the Beirut Souks        View of Beirut with snow capped Mount Sannine in the background     th century Middle Ages edit  Beirut was conquered by the Muslims in              Prince Arslan bin al Mundhir founded the Principality of Sin el Fil in Beirut in      From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon  which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon  today s Lebanon  citation needed  As a trading centre of the eastern Mediterranean  Beirut was overshadowed by Acre  in modern day Israel  during the Middle Ages  From      to       the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem   The city was taken by Saladin in      and recaptured in      by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of       John of Ibelin  known as the Old Lord of Beirut  was granted the lordship of the city in        He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut        Buildings on the Beirut waterfront  winter of            Ottoman rule edit   Pine Forest of Beirut       Under the Ottoman sultan Selim I              the Ottomans conquered Syria including present day Lebanon  Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period      One of them  Fakhr al Din II  fortified it early in the   th century  but the Ottomans reclaimed it in           With the help of Damascus  Beirut successfully broke Acre s monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region  During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha  Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about        and was an object of contention between the Ottomans  the local Druze  and the Mamluks  After Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in           Beirut began its revival    View of Beirut s Grand Serail  circa      By the second half of the nineteenth century  Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers  particularly France  European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre  This boom in cross regional trade allowed certain groups  such as the Sursock family  to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut s position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties  Meanwhile  Ottoman power in the region continued to decline  Sectarian and religious conflicts  power vacuums  and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the      Lebanon conflict  Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus      This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself  sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon  However  Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime  This was again a product of European intervention  and also a general realisation amongst the city s residents that commerce  trade  and prosperity depended on domestic stability      After petitions by the local bourgeois  the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council      the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire      The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades       Vilayet of Beirut edit  In       Beirut was made capital of a vilayet  governorate  in Syria      including the sanjaks  prefectures  Latakia  Tripoli  Beirut  Acre and Bekaa      By this time  Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States  It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions  such as the American University of Beirut  Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one  silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy  After French engineers established a modern harbour in      and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in       much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille  French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power  The      Encyclop dia Britannica reported a population consisting of        Muslims         Christians        Jews      Druze and       foreigners      At the start of the   th century  Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut  holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut  Given his modern way of life  the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city    An aerial panoramic view of Beirut in the last third of the   th centuryIn his      book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families  Dr  Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says  The seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in      to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores  and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it  Modern era edit  Capital of Lebanon edit   Saint Nicholas staircase in Ashrafieh  Ras Beirut and the Mediterranean Sea  Nightlife scene in Badaro After World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire  Beirut  along with the rest of Lebanon  was placed under the French Mandate  Lebanon achieved independence in       and Beirut became the capital city  The city remained a regional intellectual capital  becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven          especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom  This era of relative prosperity ended in      when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country          During most of the war  Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east      The downtown area  previously the home of much of the city s commercial and cultural activity  became a no man s land known as the Green Line  Many inhabitants fled to other countries  About        people died in the first two years of the war              and much of the city was devastated  A particularly destructive period was the      Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh  the main Christian district of Beirut  Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city      but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria s elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three month campaign later known as the Hundred Days  War  Another destructive chapter was the      Lebanon War  during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops  In       French and US barracks were bombed  killing     American servicemen     French servicemen  six civilians and the two suicide bombers              Since the end of the war in       the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut  whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development     stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights  By the start of the      Israel Lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist  cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce  fashion  and media  The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere  a development company established in      by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri  The city has hosted both the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup  and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant nine times                              and       Rafic Hariri was assassinated in      near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut          A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut          The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon s history at that time      The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on    April           and the two countries established diplomatic relations on    October           During the      Lebanon War  Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut  especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut  On    July       the  Operation Truthful Promise  carried out by Hezbollah ended with   Israeli deaths and   injuries  In response  the IDF targeted Hezbollah s main media outlets  There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon  and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks  Then on    July      Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon  during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon      In May       after the government decided to disband Hezbollah s communications network  a decision it later rescinded   violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces  before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army      After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar  The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries  As a result of the Doha Agreement  the opposition s barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition s protest camps in Martyrs  Square      On    October       a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut s neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh  including Brigadier General Wissam al Hassan  chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces  In addition     others were wounded in the bombing      It was the largest attack in the capital since           On    December       a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people  including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U S  Mohamad Chatah  and wounding    others      In the    November      Beirut bombings  two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery  killing    people and injuring      The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks           On   August       a massive explosion in the Port of Beirut resulted in the death of at least     people  with an additional three missing      and the wounding of more than        Foreigners from at least    countries were among the casualties  Furthermore  at least     Bangladeshis were injured in the blasts  making them the most affected foreign community  The cause of the blast is believed to be from government confiscated and stored ammonium nitrate      As many as         people have been left homeless by the explosion      Protesters in Lebanon called on the government on   August      for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the   August explosion      On    August       as a result of the protests  Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced his resignation      Weeks later  a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the port s duty free zone  on    September            Geography edit   Pigeon Rock  Raouch    Beirut seen from SPOT

originally used for Beirut s garbage south east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months  As a result  garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt  which sometimes invoked police action  This problem was commonly blamed on the country s political situation  This garbage crisis birthed a movement called  You Stink  which was directed at the country s politicians  In March       the government finally came up with a so called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage  while several municipalities across the country  in an unprecedented move  began recycling and managing waste more efficiently  building waste management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government  Moreover  Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens  sanayeh and horch Beirut   In fact  concrete roofs cover     of the capital area

Lebanon since           but estimates of Beirut s population range from as low as             through               to as high as           as part of Greater Beirut          Religion edit  See also

became largely segregated by religion since the conflict       East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority  while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia  Christians and Druze  Since the end of the civil war  East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half  The southern suburbs are populated largely by Shia Muslims  while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian  The city is also home to a small number of Latin Rite Roman Catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with Archbishop Paul Dahdah  OCD  as the apostolic vicar   Beirut Central District edit  Main article  Beirut Central District The Beirut Central District  BCD  or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut s historical and geographical core by  Solidere   the  vibrant financial  commercial  and administrative hub of the country        It is an area thousands of years old  traditionally a focus of business  finance  culture and leisure  Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments       Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the Lebanese Civil War  the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region  Ever since  Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region  That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations  reoccupation of civic and government buildings  expansion of financial activities  and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre         Roman baths park in Downtown Beirut  Assessment of the demand for build up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro economic  demographic  and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city  such as Souks  financial  cultural and recreational centres       The district s total area is           square metres             square feet   the majority of which is dedicated to residential space            square metres or            square feet        The Beirut Central District contains over    gardens  squares and open spaces  These spaces comprise landscaped streets  gardens  historical squares  pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of    acres     ha  of open spaces  The central district is Lebanon s prime location for shopping  entertainment  and dining  There are over     cafes  restaurants  pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District  and over     retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters  Beirut Souks alone are home to over     stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes  Beirut Souks are the Central District s old medieval market  recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area s historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades       Solidere  the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district  organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon  F te de la Musique  Beirut Jazz Festival  However  the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy  Rafic Hariri  who would later become prime minister  was the majority stakeholder of the company  which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public private partnership       Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates  and partly paid in company share  Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves       Today  Solidere acts as a de facto municipality  thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised  It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay  a marina where many restaurants are located  and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police  The project was also criticised for destroying some of the city s architectural and cultural heritage   Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were  the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut  wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in       Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the     s and early     s  bringing down   some of the capital s most significant buildings and structures   wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal  Critical Inquiry  in              Moreover  many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high end restaurants that only few people could afford  And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction  such as  The Garden of Forgiveness   a central park  and an archaeological museum  remain unfinished until today  when   putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population       Finally  the actual success of the project has recently when   been in doubt  given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty  due to strong military presence  the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted  and the business located there have mostly moved        Economy edit   Caf s in downtown Beirut Beirut s economy is service oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism  In an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes  the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism  though a precarious one  citation needed  With its seaport and airport coupled with Lebanon s free economic and foreign exchange system  solid gold backed currency  banking secrecy law  and favourable interest rates Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth  much of which was invested in construction  commercial enterprise  and industry  mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes  food processing  and printing        The economy of Beirut is diverse  including publishing  banking  trade and various industries  During that period  Beirut was the region s financial services center  At the onset of the oil boom starting in the     s  Lebanon based banks were the main recipients of the region s petrodollars         Zaitunay Bay Beirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon  The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban  Lebanon s central bank  the Beirut Stock Exchange  the

Banking and finance edit   Ras Beirut      The Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of      billion at the end of       nearing     times the GDP estimated at     billion by the IMF       Bank deposits also increased in      by    to     billion dollars     percent of the sector s assets   Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States   says Marwan Mikhael  head of research at BLOM Bank       Beirut s foreign reserves were still close to an all time high when they reached       billion in      and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly    percent of the Lebanese currency in the market  This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves       The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre  in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings  The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency  Moreover  no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy  The passing of the banking secrecy law on   September       subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks  branches to the  secret of the profession   Both article    of law No      dated    December      and article    of decree No       dated    August       offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks  On the first of April       decree No     established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non residents  deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from  the income tax on interest earned  the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article    of the Code of Money and Credit  the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution        Tourism edit   Raouch  The tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city  and Lebanon in general  Before the Lebanese Civil War  Beirut was widely regarded as the  Paris of the Middle East        often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture  Beirut s diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil  However  in recent times  certain countries  such as the United States  have frequently
