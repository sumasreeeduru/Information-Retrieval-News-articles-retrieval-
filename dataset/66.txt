BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization      it was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations  most well known among them the Maya and the Aztecs  In       the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its base in Mexico City  which then became known as New Spain  The Catholic Church played an important role as millions of indigenous inhabitants converted  These populations were heavily exploited to mine rich deposits of precious material  which became a major source of wealth for the Spanish      Mexico became an independent nation state after the successful Mexican War of Independence against Spain in           The War of Texas Independence in      and the Mexican American War led to huge territorial losses in Mexico s sparsely populated north  contiguous to the United States  The newly instituted reforms that granted protection to indigenous communities  and curtailed the power of the military and the church  were enshrined in the Constitution of       This triggered the War of the Reform and French intervention  Maximilian Habsburg was installed as emperor by France and Benito Ju rez kept an opposing republican government in exile  The following decades were marked by instability and dictatorship of Porfirio D az  who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order      The Porfiriato ended with the Mexican Revolution in      and the winning Constitutionalist faction drafted a new      Constitution  The revolutionary generals of the winning northern faction dominated the     s and served as presidents  but the      assassination of Alvaro Obreg n led to the formation of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in       under which Mexico was a de facto one party state until                       Mexico is a

heartland of the Aztec Empire  namely the Valley of Mexico and surrounding territories  with its people being known as the Mexica   The terms are plainly linked  it is generally believed that the toponym for the valley was the origin of the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance  but it may have been the other way around      In the colonial era  when Mexico was called New Spain  this central region became the Intendency of Mexico  during the eighteenth century reorganization of the empire  the Bourbon Reforms  After the colony achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in       said territory came to be known as the State of Mexico  with the new country being named after its capital  Mexico City  which itself was founded in      on the site of the ancient Mexica capital of Mexico Tenochtitlan  The official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed  The declaration of independence signed on   November      by the deputies of the Congress of An huac called the territory Am rica Septentrional  Northern America  in the Plan of Iguala         On two occasions            and             the country was known as Imperio Mexicano  Mexican Empire   All three federal constitutions             and       the current constitution  used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos     or the variant Estados Unidos Mexicanos      all of which have been translated as  United Mexican States   The phrase Rep blica Mexicana   Mexican Republic   was used in the      Constitutional Laws       History Main article  History of Mexico See also  History of

Mexico and Mesoamerican chronology  Pyramid of the Sun of Teotihuacan with first human establishment in the area dating back to     BC The earliest human artifacts in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon dated to circa        years ago      Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize  tomato  and beans  which produced an agricultural surplus  This enabled the transition from paleo Indian hunter gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around      BC      In the subsequent formative eras  maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex  and a vigesimal  base     numeric system  were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area      In this period  villages became more dense in terms of population  becoming socially stratified with an artisan class  and developing into chiefdoms  The most powerful rulers had religious and political power  organizing the construction of large ceremonial centers developed        Cultivation of maize  shown in the Florentine Codex        drawn by an indigenous scribe  with text in Nahuatl on this folio The earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the Olmec culture  which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around      BC  Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative era cultures in Chiapas  Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico  The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions  as well as artistic and architectural complexes      The formative era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization      In the subsequent pre classical period  the Maya and Zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte Alb n  respectively  During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi Olmec and the Zapotec cultures  The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script  The earliest written histories date from this era   The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in           In Central Mexico  the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuac n  which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area as well as north  Teotihuacan  with a population of more than         people  had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre Columbian Americas      After the collapse of Teotihuac n around     AD  competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula  At this time  during the Epi Classic  Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North  and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico  as they displaced speakers of Oto Manguean languages         Mural by Diego Rivera depicting the view from the Tlatelolco markets into Mexico Tenochtitlan  the largest city in the Americas at the time  During the early post classic era  ca            CE   Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture  Oaxaca by the Mixtec  and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chich n Itz  and Mayap n   Toward the end of the post Classic period  the Mexica established dominance  establishing a political and economic empire based in the city of Tenochtitlan  modern Mexico City   extending from central Mexico to the border with Guatemala      Alexander von Humboldt popularized the modern usage of  Aztec  as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade  custom  religion  and language to the Mexica state and  xc n Tlaht l y n  the Triple Alliance      In       with the publication of the work of William H  Prescott  it was adopted by most of the world  including   th century Mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present day Mexicans from pre conquest Mexicans  This usage has been the subject of debate since the late   th century      The Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered territories  it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them  It was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected  for example  the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center  The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city state was conquered  The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs  as long as the tributes were paid      The Aztec of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico      The Aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale  Along with this practice  they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield  Their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their Spanish counterparts  whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle      This distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the gradually Spanish conquest in the   th century  Over the next centuries many other Mexican indigenous cultures were conquered and gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule       Conquest of the Aztec Empire             Further information  Spanish conquest of Mexico  Depict of Hern n Cort s and his bilingual cultural translator  Do a Marina    Malinche    meeting Moctezuma II from the Lienzo de Tlaxcala  This historical document was created c       by the Tlaxcalans to remind the Spanish of their loyalty and the importance of Tlaxcala during the conquest of the Aztec Empire  Although the Spanish had established colonies in the Caribbean starting in       it was not until the second decade of the sixteenth century that they began exploring the coast of Mexico  The Spanish first learned of Mexico during the Juan de Grijalva expedition of       The natives kept  repeating  Colua  Colua  and Mexico  Mexico  but we  explorers  did not know what Colua or Mexico meant   until encountering Montezuma s governor at the mouth of the Rio de las Banderas             The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February      when Hern n Cort s landed on the Gulf Coast and founded the Spanish city of Veracruz  Around     conquistadores  along with horses  cannons  swords  and long guns gave the Spanish some technological advantages over indigenous warriors  but key to the Spanish victory was making strategic alliances with disgruntled indigenous city states  altepetl  who supplied the Spaniards and fought with them against the Aztec Triple Alliance   Also important to the Spanish victory was Cort s s cultural translator  Malinche  a Nahua woman enslaved in the Maya area whom the Spanish acquired as a gift   She quickly learned Spanish and gave strategic advise about how to deal with both indigenous allies and indigenous foes       The unconquered city state of Tlaxcala allied with the Spanish against their enemies  the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan  The Spanish gained other indigenous allies  who also joined in the war for their own reasons  We know so much about the conquest because it is among the best documented events in world history from multiple points of view  There are accounts by the Spanish leader Cort s     and multiple other Spanish participants  including Bernal D az del Castillo          There are indigenous accounts in Spanish  Nahuatl  and pictorial narratives by allies of the Spanish  most prominently the Tlaxcalans  as well as Texcocans     and Huejotzincans  and the defeated Mexican themselves  recorded in the last volume of Bernardino de Sahag n s General History of the Things of New Spain                Smallpox depicted by an indigenous artist in the      Florentine Codex in its account of the conquest of Mexico from the point of view of the defeated Mexica  When the Spaniards arrived  the ruler of the Aztec empire was Moctezuma II  who after a delay allowed the Spanish to proceed inland to Tenochtitlan  The Spanish captured him  holding him hostage   He died while in their custody and the Spanish retreated from Tenochtitlan in great disarray  His successor and brother Cuitl huac took control of the Aztec empire  but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later      Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors  among whom smallpox  measles  and other contagious diseases were endemic  epidemics of Old World infectious diseases ravaged Mesoamerica starting in the     s  The exact number of deaths is disputed  but unquestionably more than   million natives who they had no immunity      Other sources  however  mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached    million  out of a population of less than    million  although such a high number conflicts with the         Aztecs who ruled an empire of   million or    million      Severely weakened  the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cort s and his forces on his second return with the help of state of Tlaxcala whose population estimate was              The native population declined        by      to       million  Any population estimate of pre Columbian Mexico is bound to be a guess but      million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation  The territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain in           Mexico City was systematically rebuilt by Cort s following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in       Much of the identity  traditions and architecture of Mexico developed during the     year colonial period from      to

viceroys and Presidents of Mexico and now the seat of the Mexican government  The      capture Tenochtitlan and immediate founding of the Spanish capital Mexico City on its ruins was the beginning of a     year long colonial era during which Mexico was known as Nueva Espa a  New Spain   The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire  The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church  both under the authority of the Spanish crown  In      the pope had granted sweeping powers to the Spanish crown  with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms  In       King Charles I created the Council of the Indies based in Spain to oversee State power its overseas territories  in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City  the Real Audiencia  and then in      created the viceroyalty  The viceroy was highest official of the State  In the religious sphere  the diocese of Mexico was created in      and elevated to the Archdiocese of Mexico in       with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy  overseeing Roman Catholic clergy  Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers  The Catholic faith the only one permitted  with non Catholics  Jews and Protestants  and Catholics  excluding Indians  holding unorthodox views being subject to the Mexican Inquisition  established in           In the first half century of Spanish rule  a network of Spanish cities was created  sometimes on pre Hispanic sites  The capital Mexico City was and remains the premier city  Cities and towns were hubs of civil officials  ecclesiastics  business  Spanish elites  and mixed race and indigenous artisans and workers  When deposits of silver were discovered in sparsely populated northern Mexico  far from the dense populations of central Mexico  the Spanish secured the region against fiercely resistant indigenous Chichimecas   The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico  Central America as far south as Costa Rica  and the western United States  The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the Spanish West Indies  the Caribbean   the Spanish East Indies  that is  the Philippines   and Spanish Florida  In       the Spain signed the Adams On s Treaty with the United States  setting New Spain s northern boundary        Viceroyalty of New Spain following the signing of the      Adams On s Treaty The population of Mexico was overwhelmingly indigenous and rural during the entire colonial period and beyond  despite the massive decrease in their numbers due to epidemic diseases  Diseases such as smallpox  measles  and others were introduced by Europeans and African slaves  especially in the sixteenth century  The indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the   th century from the most commonly accepted five to thirty million pre contact population      During the three hundred years of the colonial era  Mexico received between         and         Europeans      between         and         African slaves      and between        and         Asians          The first census in Mexico  then known as New Spain  that included an ethnic classification was the      census  Also known as the Revillagigedo census  Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost  thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as German scientist Alexander von Humboldt  Europeans ranged from     to     of New Spain s population  Mestizos from     to      Indians from     to     and Africans were between       and         The total population ranged from           to            It is concluded that the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even  while the percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of         per century  mostly due to the latter having higher mortality rates from living in remote locations and being in constant war with the colonists      Independent era Mexico eliminated the legal basis of the Colonial caste system which led to exclusion of racial classification in the censuses to come    Luis de Mena  Virgin of Guadalupe and castas  showing race mixture and hierarchy as well as fruits of the realm      ca       Colonial law with Spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction  the Cabildos  and the Spanish Crown  Upper administrative offices were closed to native born people  even those of pure Spanish blood  criollos   Administration was based on the racial separation  Society was organized in a racial hierarchy  with whites on top  mixed race persons and blacks in the middle  and indigenous at the bottom  There were formal legal designations of racial categories  The Republic of Spaniards  Rep blica de Espa oles  comprised European  and American born Spaniards  mixed race castas  and black Africans  The Republic of Indians  Rep blica de Indios  comprised the indigenous populations  which the Spanish lumped under the term Indian  indio   a Spanish colonial social construct which indigenous groups and individuals rejected as a category  Spaniards were exempt from paying tribute  Spanish men had access to higher education  could hold civil and ecclesiastical offices  were subject to the Inquisition  and liable for military service when the standing military was established in the late eighteenth century  Indigenous paid tribute  but were exempt from the Inquisition  indigenous men were excluded from the priesthood  and exempt from military service  Although the racial system appears fixed and rigid  there was some fluidity within it  and racial domination of whites was not complete      Since the indigenous population of New Spain was so large  there was less labor demand for expensive black slaves than other parts of Spanish America           In the late eighteenth century the crown instituted reforms that privileged Iberian born Spaniards  peninsulares  over American born  criollos   limiting their access to offices  This discrimination between the two became a sparking point of discontent for white elites in the colony      The Marian apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe said to have appeared to the indigenous Juan Diego in      gave impetus to the evangelization of central Mexico          The Virgin of Guadalupe became a symbol for American born Spaniards   criollos  patriotism  seeking in her a Mexican source of pride  distinct from Spain      The Virgin of Guadalupe was invoked by the insurgents for independence who followed Father Miguel Hidalgo during the War of Independence        New Spain was essential to the Spanish global trading system  White represents the route of the Spanish Manila Galleons in the Pacific and the Spanish convoys in the Atlantic   Blue represents Portuguese routes   The rich deposits of silver  particularly in Zacatecas and Guanajuato  resulted in silver extraction dominating the economy of New Spain  Taxes on silver production became a major source of income for Spain  Other important industries were the haciendas and mercantile activities in the main cities and ports      Wealth created during the colonial era spurred the development of New Spanish Baroque  citation needed  As a result of its trade links with Asia  the rest of the Americas  Africa and Europe and the profound effect of New World

city       The Nao de China  Manila Galleons  operated for two and a half centuries and connected New Spain with Asia  Silver and the red dye cochineal were shipped from Veracruz to Atlantic ports in the Americas and Spain  Veracruz was also the main port of entry in mainland New Spain for European goods  immigrants from Spain  and African slaves  The Camino Real de Tierra Adentro connected Mexico City with the interior of New Spain  Mexican silver pesos became the first globally used currency    Silver peso mined and minted in colonial Mexico  which became a global currency  Spanish forces  sometimes accompanied by native allies  led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era  Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the Chichimeca War                  Tepehu n Revolt                  and the Pueblo Revolt         the Tzeltal Rebellion of      was a regional Maya revolt       Most rebellions were small scale and local  posing no major threat to the ruling elites       To protect Mexico from the attacks of English  French  and Dutch pirates and protect the Crown s monopoly of revenue  only two ports were open to foreign trade Veracruz on the Atlantic and Acapulco on the Pacific  Among the best known pirate attacks are the      Sack of Campeche     and      Attack on Veracruz       Of greater concern to the crown was of foreign invasion  especially after Britain seized in      the Spanish ports of Havana  Cuba and Manila  the Philippines in the Seven Years  War  It created a standing military  increased coastal fortifications  and expanded the northern presidios and missions into Alta California  The volatility of the urban poor in Mexico City was evident in the      riot in the Z calo  The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full scale attack on the seats of power  with the viceregal palace and the archbishop s residence attacked by the mob      Due to the importance of New Spain administrative base  Mexico was the location of the first printing shop             first university             first public park             and first public library        in the Americas       among other institutions  Important artists of the colonial period  include the writers Juan Ruiz de Alarc n  Carlos de Sig enza y G ngora  and Sor Juana In s de la Cruz  painters Crist

Guadalupe  Antonio Fabr s       On    September       a  loyalist revolt  against the ruling junta was declared by priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla  in the small town of Dolores  Guanajuato       This event  known as the Cry of Dolores  Spanish  Grito de Dolores  is commemorated each year  on    September  as Mexico s independence day       The first insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo  the Spanish viceregal army captain Ignacio Allende  the militia captain Juan Aldama and La Corregidora  English   The Magistrate   Josefa Ortiz de Dom nguez  Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and executed by firing squad in Chihuahua  on    July                  Following Hidalgo s death  the leadership was assumed by Ignacio L pez Ray n and then by the priest Jos  Mar a Morelos  who occupied key southern cities with the support of Mariano Matamoros and Nicol s Bravo  In one notable incident  Nicolas Bravo captured     royalist soldiers  whom Morelos ordered should be executed in revenge of the murder of Bravo s father  In an act of mercy  Bravo instead pardoned the prisoners  most of whom then joined the insurgent cause             In      the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened and  on   November  signed the  Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America                This Act also abolished slavery and the caste system and  being a Catholic

Agust n de Iturbide  became regent  as newly independent Mexico sought a constitutional monarch from Europe   When no member of a European royal house desired the position  Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agust n I  The young and weak United States was the first country to recognize Mexico s independence  sending an ambassador to the court of the emperor and sending a message to Europe via the Monroe Doctrine not to intervene in Mexico   The emperor s rule was short           and he was overthrown by army officers             The successful rebels established the First Mexican

  The overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico s economic development  It was a prelude to more civil wars and yet another foreign invasion  The Liberal Reform attempted to modernize Mexico s economy and institutions along liberal principles  They promulgated a new Constitution of       separating Church and State  stripping the Conservative institutions of the Church and the military of their special privileges  fueros   mandating the sale of Church owned property and sale of indigenous community lands  and secularizing education       Conservatives revolted  touching off civil war between rival Liberal and Conservative governments            The Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield  but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French  Mexican conservatives asked Emperor Napoleon III to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico  The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Hapsburg on the newly established throne of Mexico  supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army  The Liberal republic under Benito Ju rez was basically a government in internal exile  but with the end of the Civil War in the U S  in April       that government began aiding the Mexican Republic  Two years later  the French Army withdrew its support  Maximilian remained in Mexico rather than return to Europe  Republican forces captured him and he was executed in Quer taro  along with two Conservative Mexican generals   The  Restored Republic  saw the return of Ju rez  who was  the personification of the embattled republic        as president  The Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily  but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders  Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism        The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed  New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French

order and progress   The Porfiriato was characterized by economic stability and growth  significant foreign investment and influence  an expansion of the railroad network and telecommunications  and investments in the arts and sciences       The period was also marked by economic inequality and political repression  D az knew the potential for army rebellions  and systematically downsized the expenditure for the force  rather expanding the rural police force under direct control of the president  D az did not provoke the Catholic Church  coming to a modus vivendi with it  but he did not remove the anticlerical articles from the      Constitution  From the late nineteenth century Porfiriato  Protestants began to make inroads in Mexico  The government encouraged British and U S  investment  Commercial agriculture developed in northern Mexico  with many investors from the U S  acquiring vast ranching estates and expanding irrigated cultivation of crops  The Mexican government ordered a survey of land with the aim of selling it for development  In this period  many indigenous communities lost their lands and the men became landless wage earners on large landed enterprises  haciendas        British and U S  investors developed extractive mining of copper  lead  and other minerals  as well as petroleum on the Gulf Coast  Changes in Mexican law allowed for private enterprises to own the subsoil rights of land  rather than continuing the colonial law that gave all subsoil rights to the State   An industrial manufacturing sector also developed  particularly in textiles   At the same time  new enterprises gave rise to an industrial work force  which began organizing to gain labor rights and protections  D az ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the cient ficos   scientists         The most influential cientifco was Secretary of Finance Jos  Yves Limantour       The Porfirian regime was influenced by positivism       They rejected theology and idealism in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development  As an integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education  D az s long success did not include planning for a political transition beyond his own presidency  He made no attempt  however  to establish a family dynasty  naming no relative as his successor   As the centennial of independence approached  D az gave an interview where he said he was not going to run in the      elections  when he would be     Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders  But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity  including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family  Francisco I  Madero  Madero won a surprising amount of

military coup d  tat overthrew Madero s government  with the support of the U S   resulted in Madero s murder by agents of Federal Army General Victoriano Huerta  A coalition of anti Huerta forces in the North  the Constitutionalist Army overseen by Venustiano Carranza  and a peasant army in the South under Emiliano Zapata  defeated the Federal Army  In      that army was dissolved as an institution  Following the revolutionaries  victory against Huerta  revolutionary armies sought to broker a peaceful political solution  but the coalition splintered  plunging Mexico into civil war again  Constitutionalist general Pancho Villa  commander of the Division of the North  broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata  Carranza s best general  Alvaro Obreg n  defeated Villa  his former comrade in arms in the battle of Celaya in       and Villa s forces melted away  Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico  and the U S  recognized his government  In       the winners met at a constitutional convention to draft the Constitution of       which was ratified in February       Said Constitution strengthened the anticlerical provisions that were carried over from the

of inference and intervention in Mexico  most notably the Mexican American War  During the Revolution  the Taft administration supported the Huerta coup against Madero  but when Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated as president in March       it refused to recognize Huerta s regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists  Wilson ordered troops to occupy the strategic port of Veracruz in       which was lifted       After Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in       he led a raid into Columbus  New Mexico incursion  prompting the U S  to send        troops led by General John J  Pershing in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa  Carranza pushed back against U S  troops being in northern Mexico  The expeditionary forces withdrew as the U S  entered World War I        Germany attempted to get Mexico to side with it  sending a coded telegram in      to incite war between the U S  and Mexico  with Mexico to regain the territory it lost in the Mexican American War       Mexico remained neutral in the conflict  Consolidating power  President Carranza had peasant leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in                 Carranza had gained support of the peasantry during the Revolution  but once in power he did little to distribute land  and  in fact  returned some confiscated land to their original owners  President Carranza s best general  Obreg n  served briefly in Carranza s administration  but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the      presidential election  Carranza chose a political and revolutionary no body to succeed him  Obreg n and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the Plan of Agua Prieta  overthrowing Carranza  who died fleeing Mexico City in       General Adolfo de la Huerta became

military has been President of Mexico  The post revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country  end military intervention in politics  and create organizations of interest groups  Workers  peasants  urban office workers  and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in       Obreg n instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor  He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to settle claims with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution  He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general  Calles  as his successor  prompting an unsuccessful military revolt  As president Calles provoked a major conflict with the Catholic Church and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the      Constitution  The Church State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the U S  Ambassador to Mexico and ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict  by means of which the respective fields of action were defined  Although the constitution prohibited reelection of the president  Obreg n wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non consecutive re election   Obreg n won the      elections  but was assassinated by a Catholic zealot  causing a political crisis of succession  Calles could not become president again  since he has just ended his term   He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession

presidency  Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the Maximato              The Maximato ended during the presidency of L zaro C rdenas  who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms  This included the Mexican oil expropriation in March       which nationalized the U S  and Anglo Dutch oil company known as the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company  This movement would result in the creation of the state owned Mexican oil company Pemex  This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C rdenas s radical measure  but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico  C rdenas s successor  Manuel  vila Camacho             was more moderate  and relations between the U S  and Mexico vastly improved during World War II  when Mexico was a significant ally  providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort  From      the election of Miguel Alem n  the first civilian president in the post revolutionary period  Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development  known as the Mexican miracle  which was characterized by industrialization  urbanization  and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas        With robust economic growth  Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the      Summer Olympics  The government poured huge resources into building new facilities  At the same time  there was political unrest by university students and others with those expenditures  while their own circumstances were difficult  Demonstrations in central Mexico City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games  with the government of Gustavo D az Ordaz cracking down  The culmination was the Tlatelolco Massacre       which claimed the lives of around     protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as             Logo for the      Mexico Olympics

and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the Mexican Dirty War      Luis Echeverr a  Minister of the Interior under D az Ordaz  carrying out the repression during the Olympics  was elected president in       His government had to contend with mistrust of Mexicans and increasing economic problems  He instituted some with electoral reforms            Echeverr a chose Jos  L pez Portillo as his successor in       Economic problems worsened in his early term  then massive reserves of petroleum were located off Mexico s Gulf Coast  Pemex did not have the capacity to develop these reserves itself  and brought in foreign firms   Oil prices had been high because of OPEC s lock on oil production  and L pez Portilla borrowed money from foreign banks for current spending to fund social programs   Those foreign banks were happy to lend to Mexico because the oil reserves were enormous and future revenues were collateral for loans denominated in U S  dollars   When the price of oil dropped  Mexico s economy collapsed in the      Crisis  Interest rates soared  the peso devalued  and unable to pay loans  the government defaulted on its debt  President Miguel de la Madrid           resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation  In the     s the first cracks emerged in the PRI s complete political dominance  In Baja California  the PAN candidate was elected as governor  When De la Madrid chose Carlos Salinas de Gortari as the candidate for the PRI  and therefore a foregone presidential victor  Cuauht moc C rdenas  son of former President L zaro C rdenas  broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the      elections  In      there was massive electoral fraud  with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever  There were massive protests in Mexico City to the stolen election  Salinas took the oath of office on   December            In      the PRI was famously described by Mario Vargas Llosa as the  perfect dictatorship   but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI s hegemony                   NAFTA signing ceremony  October       From left to right   standing

reforms which fixed the exchange rate of the peso  controlled inflation  opened Mexico to foreign investment  and began talks with the U S  and Canada to join their free trade agreement  In order to do that  the Constitution of      was amended in several important ways  Article     which allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land  was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners  property rights   The anti clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions  especially the Catholic Church  were amended and Mexico reestablished of diplomatic relations with the Holy See  to which the Mexican State did not recognize as a political entity  Signing on to the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  removed Mexico s autonomy over trade policy  The agreement came into effect on   January       the same day  the Zapatista Army of National Liberation  EZLN  started a two week long armed rebellion against the federal government  and has continued as a non violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization  In       following the assassination of the PRI s presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio  Salinas was succeeded by substitute PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo  Salinas left Zedillo s government to deal with the Mexican peso crisis  requiring a     billion IMF bailout  Major macroeconomic reforms were

Land north of the Tropic of Cancer experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months  South of the Tropic of Cancer  temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation  This gives Mexico one of the world s most diverse weather systems  Areas south of the Tropic of Cancer with elevations up to       m        ft   the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucat n Peninsula   have a yearly median temperature between    to     C       to       F   Temperatures here remain high throughout the year  with only a    C     F  difference between winter and summer median temperatures  Both Mexican coasts  except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja  are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall  Although low lying areas north of the Tropic of Cancer are hot and humid during the summer  they generally have lower yearly temperature averages  from    to     C or      to       F  because of more moderate conditions during the winter  Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above       m        ft   This gives them a year round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages  from    to     C or      to       F  and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year  Many parts of Mexico  particularly the north  have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than       mm       in  of annual precipitation  For example  many cities in the north like Monterrey  Hermosillo  and Mexicali experience temperatures of     C       F  or more in summer  In the Sonoran Desert temperatures reach     C       F  or more   Biodiversity  Mexican wolf  Gray whale Mexico

upper middle income country  or a middle class country            Mexico s National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy  CONEVAL   which is the organization in charge to measure the country s poverty reports that a huge percentage of Mexico s population lives in poverty  According to said council  from      to       year on which the CONEVAL published its first nationwide report of poverty  the portion of Mexicans who live in poverty rose from              to         million people        However  rather than Mexico s economy crashing  international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the country s poverty line to the CONEVAL using new standards to define it  as now besides people who lives below the economic welfare line  people who lacks at least one  social need  such as complete education  access to healthcare  access to regular food  housing services and goods  social security etc  were considered to be living in poverty  several countries do collect information regarding the persistence of said vulnerabilities on their population  but Mexico is the only one that classifies people lacking one or more of those needs as living below its national poverty line   Said economists do point out that the percentage of people living in poverty according to Mexico s national poverty line is around    times higher than the one reported by the World Bank s international poverty line  with said difference being the biggest in the world  and ponder if it would not be better for countries in the situation of Mexico to adopt internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons       According to the OECD s own poverty line  defined as the percentage of a country s population who earns          or less of the national median income      of Mexico s population lives in a situation of poverty         Mexican Stock

Throughout the   th century  the population of Mexico had barely doubled  This trend continued during the first two decades of the   th century  and even in the      census there was a loss of about   million inhabitants  The phenomenon can be explained because during the decade from      to      the Mexican Revolution took place  The growth rate increased dramatically between the     s and the     s  when the country registered growth rates of over                 The Mexican population doubled in twenty years  and at that rate it was expected that by the year      there would be     million Mexicans  Life expectancy went from    years  in       to    years  in the year        According to estimations made by Mexico s National Geography and Statistics Institute  as of      Mexico has       million inhabitants      making it the most populous Spanish speaking country in the world       Between      and       the Mexican population grew at an average of       per year  up from       per year between      and       Even though Mexico is a very ethnically diverse country  research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field  in consequence of the post revolutionary efforts of Mexico s government to unify all non indigenous Mexicans under a single ethnic identity  that of the  Mestizo    As a result  since      the only explicit ethnic classification that has been included in Mexican censuses has been that of  Indigenous peoples        Even then  across the years the government has used different criterias to count Indigenous peoples  with each of them returning considerably different numbers ranging from      to     of the country s population  It is not until very recently that the Mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered other ethnic groups that live in the country such as Afro Mexicans who amount to    of Mexico s population      or White Mexicans           which amount to     of Mexico s population  with the criteria being based on appearance rather than on self declared of ancestry                            Less numerous groups in Mexico such as Asians and Middle Easterners are also accounted for  with numbers of around    each  As of      update   it is estimated that     million foreigners have settled in the country       up from nearly   million in            The vast majority of migrants come from the United States            making Mexico the top destination for U S  citizens abroad       The second largest group comes from neighboring Guatemala           followed by Spain                Other major sources of migration are fellow Latin American countries  which include Colombia           Argentina          and Cuba                Historically  the Lebanese diaspora and the German born Mennonite migration have left a notorious impact in the country s culture  particularly in its cuisine and traditional music            At the turn of the   st century  several trends have increased the number of foreigners residing in the country such as the           Spanish financial crisis       increasing gang related violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America       the ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela            and the automotive industry boom led by Japanese and South Korean investment             Ethnicity and race  Las castas  Casta painting showing    racial groupings  Anonymous    th century  oil on canvas          cm  Museo Nacional del Virreinato  Tepotzotl n  Mexico  Regardless of ethnicity  the majority of Mexicans are united under the same national identity       This is the product of an ideology strongly promoted by Mexican academics such as Manuel Gamio and Jos  Vasconcelos known as mestizaje  whose goal was that of Mexico becoming a racially and culturally homogeneous country                 The ideology s influence was reflected in Mexico s national censuses of      and       in the former  which was Mexico s first ever national census  but second ever if the census made in colonial times is taken into account      that considered race  approximately     of Mexico s population identified as Mestizos       and in the latter  Mexico s government declared that all Mexicans were now Mestizos  for which racial classifications would be dropped in favor of language based ones in future censuses       During most of the   th century these censuses  results were taken as fact  with extraofficial international publications often using them as a reference to estimate Mexico s racial composition                 but in recent time historians and academics have claimed that said resuslts are not accurate  as on its efforts to homogenize Mexico the government inflated the Mestizo label s percentage by classifying a good number of people as such regardless of whether they were of actual mixed ancestry or not                      pointing out that an alteration so drastic of population trends compared to earlier censuses such as New Spain s      census  on which Europeans were estimated to be     to     of the population  Mestizos     to     and Indigenous peoples     to          is not possible and that the frequency of marriages between people of different ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico was low            it is also observed that when asked directly about their ethno racial identification  many Mexicans nowadays do not identify as Mestizos      and that  static  ethnoracial labels such as  White  or  Indian  are far more prominent in contemporary Mexican society than the  Mestizo  one is  whose use is mostly limited to intellectual circles  result of the label s constantly changing and subjective definition       The total percentage of Mexico s indigenous peoples tends to vary depending on the criteria used by the government on its censuses  it is      if the ability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous       if racial self identification is used it is            a  and if people who consider themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to           Nonetheless  all the censuses conclude that the majority of Mexico s indigenous population is concentrated in rural areas of the southern and south eastern Mexican states       with the highest percentages being found in Yucat n at     of the population  Oaxaca with      Quintana Roo with      Chiapas with     and Campeche with                Similarly to Mestizo and indigenous peoples  estimates of the percentage of European descended Mexicans vary considerably depending of the criteria used  recent nationwide field surveys that account for different phenotypical traits  hair color  skin color etc   report a percentage between                   if the criteria is the presence of blond hair  and of     if the criteria is skin color  with the later surveys having been conducted by Mexico s government itself                           While during the colonial era  most of the European migration into Mexico was Spanish  in the   th and   th centuries a substantial number of non Spanish Europeans immigrated to the country       with Europeans often being the most numerous ethnic group in colonial Mexican cities            Nowadays Mexico s northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European populations  with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry         Puebla de Zaragoza is the most populated city of Puebla The Afro Mexican population            individuals as of      update        is an ethnic group made up of descendants of Colonial era slaves and recent immigrants of sub Saharan African descent  Mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period  and some         Africans were taken there  primarily in the   th century  The creation of a national Mexican identity  especially after the Mexican Revolution  emphasized Mexico s indigenous and European past  it passively eliminated the African ancestors and contributions  Most of the African descended population was absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo  mixed European indigenous  and indigenous populations through unions among the groups  Evidence of this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the      inter census                  of Afro Mexicans also identified as indigenous  It was also reported that      of Afro Mexicans speak an indigenous language       The states with the highest self report of Afro Mexicans were Guerrero       of the population   Oaxaca         and Veracruz               Afro Mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and Costa Chica of Guerrero  During the early   th century  a substantial number of Arabs  mostly Christians       began arriving from the crumbling Ottoman Empire  The largest group were the Lebanese and an estimated         Mexicans have some Lebanese ancestry       Smaller ethnic groups in Mexico include South and East Asians  present since the colonial era  During the colonial era Asians were termed Chino  regardless of ethnicity   and arrived as merchants  artisans and slaves       A study by Juan Esteban Rodr guez  a graduate student at the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity  indicated that up to one third of people sampled from Guerrero state had significantly more Asian ancestry than most Mexicans  primarily Filipino or Indonesian            Modern Asian immigration began in the late   th century  and at one point in the early   th century the Chinese were the second largest immigrant group        Emigration Main article  Emigration from Mexico In the early     s  around         Mexicans lived abroad  which increased sevenfold by the     s to     million       At the turn of the   st century  this figure more than doubled to     million       As of       it is estimated that      million Mexicans live abroad  primarily in the United States  which concentrates nearly     of the expatriate population       The majority of Mexicans have settled in states such as California  Texas and Illinois  particularly around the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles  Chicago  Houston and Dallas Fort Worth       As a result of these major migration flows in recent decades  around    million U S  residents  or       of the country s population  identified as being of full or partial Mexican ancestry       The remaining    of expatriates have settled in Canada           primarily in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec       followed by Spain          and Germany           both European destinations represent almost two thirds of the Mexican population living in the continent       As for Latin America  it is estimated that        Mexicans live in the region  Guatemala          being the top destination for expatriates  followed by Bolivia          and Panama

the varieties of the language spoken in the country  which differ from one region to another in sound  structure  and vocabulary       In general  Mexican Spanish does not make any phonetic distinction among the letters s and z  as well as c when preceding the vowels e and i  as opposed to Peninsular Spanish  The letters b and v have the same pronunciation as well       Furthermore  the usage of vos  the second person singular pronoun  found in several Latin American varieties  is replaced by t   whereas vosotros  the second person plural pronoun  fell out of use and was effectively replaced by ustedes       In written form  the Spanish Royal Academy serves as the primary guideline for spelling  except for words of Amerindian origin that retain their original phonology such as cenzontle instead of sinzontle and M xico not M jico  Words of foreign origin also maintain their original spelling such as whisky and film  as opposed to g isqui and filme as the Royal Academy suggests       The letter x is distinctly used in Mexican Spanish  which may be pronounced as  ks   as in ox geno or taxi   as     particularly in Amerindian words  e g  mixiote  Xola and uxmal  and as the voiceless velar fricative  x   such as Texas and Oaxaca        The federal government officially recognizes sixty eight linguistic groups and     varieties of indigenous languages       It is estimated that around     million citizens speak these languages       with Nahuatl being the most widely spoken by more than     million  followed by Yucatec Maya used daily by nearly         people  Tzeltal and Tzotzil  two variants of the Mayan languages  are spoken by around half a million people each  primarily in the southern state of Chiapas       Mixtec and Zapotec  both with estimated         native speakers each  are two other well known language groups       Since its creation in March       the National Indigenous Languages Institute has been in charge of promoting and protecting the use of the country s indigenous languages  through the General Law of Indigenous Peoples  Linguistic Rights  which recognizes them de jure as  national languages  with status equal to that of Spanish       Notwithstanding  in practice  indigenous peoples often face discrimination and are unable to have proper access to public services such as education and healthcare  as well as the justice system  as Spanish is the prominent language       Aside from indigenous languages  there are several minority languages spoken in Mexico due to international migration such as Low German by the        strong Menonite population  primarily settled in the northern states  fuelled by the tolerance of the federal government towards this community by allowing them to set their own educational system compatible with their customs and traditions       The Chipilo dialect  a variance of the Venetian language  is spoken in the town of Chipilo  located in the central state of Puebla  by around       people  mainly descendants of Venetians that migrated to the area in the late   th century       Furthermore  English is the most commonly taught foreign language in Mexico  It is estimated that nearly    million  or around a fifth of the population  study the language through public schools  private institutions or self access channels       However  a high level of English proficiency is limited to

Catholic community in the world  after Brazil s           percent of them attend church services weekly       The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe  the patron saint of Mexico  is celebrated on    December and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country       The denominations Pentecostal also have an important presence  especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities  In fact  Pentecostal churches together have more than     million adherents  which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico  The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities  The third largest Christian group is the Jehovah s Witnesses  which totals more than   million adherents  In the same census The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  whose members are known as Mormons  reported         members     though the church claimed in      to have over one million registered members        Other groups are growing  such as Iglesia apost lica de la Fe en Cristo Jes s  Mennonites and Seventh day Adventist Church and Church of the La Luz del Mundo  which has its center in  La Hermosa Provincia   a colony of Guadalajara  Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity  including branches Protestants  Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church       The presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to       when Hern n Cort s conquered the Aztecs  accompanied by several Conversos        According to the      census  there are        Jews in Mexico     Islam in Mexico is practiced mostly by Arab Mexicans  In the      census        Mexicans reported belonging to an Eastern religion     a category which includes a tiny Buddhist population  According to Jacobo Grinberg  in texts edited by the National Autonomous University of Mexico   it is remarkable the survival of magic religious rituals of the old indigenous groups  not only in the current indigenous people but in the mestizos and whites that make up the Mexican rural and urban society  There is often a syncretism between shamanism and the Catholic tradition  Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico  especially in recent years  is the Santer a  This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the Cuban Revolution  mainly in states such as Veracruz and Yucat n   Although Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from Africa in the   th century  the apogee of these cults is relatively new       In general  popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions  One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of Holy Dead  Santa Muerte   The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult  However  most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers  and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the Christ Child and the adoration of God  Other examples are the representations of the Passion of Christ and the celebration of Day of the Dead  which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary  but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists       In certain regions  the profession of a creed other than the Catholic is seen as a threat to community unity  It is argued that the Catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity  and that the Protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices  the tequio or community work  participation in the festivities and similar issues   The refusal of the Protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images  In extreme cases  tension between Catholics and Protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of Protestants in several villages  The best known cases are those of San Juan Chamula            in Chiapas  and San Nicol s  in Ixmiquilpan       Hidalgo  A similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the Republic to expel the Summer Linguistic Institute  SIL   in the year       which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the Bible into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a Protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures  The Mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the SIL        Health Main article  Healthcare in Mexico  General Hospital of Mexico in Mexico City  Since the early     s  Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan       Mexico s medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities            but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures  forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care       Social determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico  State funded institutions such as Mexican Social Security Institute  IMSS  and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers  ISSSTE  play a major role in health and social security  Private health services are also very important and account for     of all medical units in the country       Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings  Some public universities in Mexico  such as the University of Guadalajara  have signed agreements with the U S  to receive and train American students in Medicine  Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners        Education  Central Library of the National Autonomous University of Mexico Main article  Education in Mexico In       the

status defined within the context of the family and local community   With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century  following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire  cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages   Beginning in the late nineteenth century  women including middle class women began working outside the home in offices and factories  and the gained access to education            Women were granted suffrage in            In the   st century  Mexican women are prominent in politics  academia  journalism  literature  and visual arts among other fields  In President Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador s first cabinet following his      election  he appointed women in equal numbers as men       However  a wave of feminism in      has criticized the president for his tone deaf response to murders of women in Mexico       Mexico is among the countries that treat particular murders of women as femicide       In       Mexico had the   th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world       The remains of the victims were frequently mutilated       According to a      study  domestic abuse in Mexican culture  is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in Mexican women s dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self esteem  sustained by ideologies of romantic love  by family structure and residential arrangements        The perpetrators are often the boyfriend  father in law  ex husbands or husbands but only      of the murder cases led to an arrest and sentencing in
