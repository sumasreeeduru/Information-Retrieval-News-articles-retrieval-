reality     In everyday language  truth is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it  such as beliefs  propositions  and declarative sentences     Truth is usually held to be the opposite of falsehood  The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts  including philosophy  art  theology  and science  Most human activities depend upon the concept  where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion  these include most of the sciences  law  journalism  and everyday life  Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic  and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself     Most commonly  truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to a mind independent world  This is called the correspondence theory of truth  Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars  philosophers  and theologians        There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates  such as  How do we define truth  Is it even possible to give an informative definition of truth  What things are truthbearers and are therefore capable of being true or false  Are truth and falsehood bivalent  or are there other truth values  What are the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood  What role does truth play in constituting knowledge  And is truth always absolute  or can it be relative to one s perspective

is derived from Old English tr ew   tr ow   tr w   Middle English trew e  cognate to Old High German triuwida  Old Norse trygg   Like troth  it is a  th nominalisation of the adjective true  Old English tr owe   The English word true is from Old English  West Saxon   ge tr ewe  tr owe  cognate to Old Saxon  gi tr ui  Old High German  ga triuwu  Modern German treu  faithful    Old Norse tryggr  Gothic triggws     all from a Proto Germanic  trewwj   having good faith   perhaps ultimately from PIE  dru   tree   on the notion of  steadfast as an oak   e g   Sanskrit d  ru   piece of  wood       Old Norse tr    faith  word of honour  religious faith  belief      archaic English troth  loyalty  honesty  good faith   compare  satr    Thus   truth  involves both the quality of  faithfulness  fidelity  loyalty  sincerity  veracity      and that of  agreement with fact or reality   in Anglo Saxon expressed by s    Modern English sooth   All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth  fidelity  and truth  factuality   To express  factuality   North Germanic opted for nouns derived from sanna  to assert  affirm   while continental West Germanic  German and Dutch  opted for continuations of w ra  faith  trust  pact   cognate to Slavic v ra   religious  faith   but influenced by Latin verus   Romance languages use terms following the Latin veritas  while the Greek aletheia  Russian pravda  South Slavic istina and Sanskrit sat  related to English sooth and North Germanic sanna  have separate etymological origins  In some modern contexts  the word  truth  is used to refer to fidelity to an original or standard  It can also be used in the context of being  true to oneself  in the sense of acting with authenticity      Major theories edit  The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words  symbols  ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true  whether by a single person or an entire society  is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below  Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars            Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed  More recently developed  deflationary  or  minimalist  theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories  Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like true to a statement does not assert anything significant about it  for instance  anything about its nature  Minimalist reasoning realises truth as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement  to stress claims  or to form general assumptions              Substantive edit  Correspondence edit  Main article  Correspondence theory of truth Correspondence theories emphasize that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs      This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand  and things or objects on the other  It is a traditional model tracing its origins to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates  Plato  and Aristotle      This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to  things  by whether it accurately describes those  things   A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas   Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus    Truth is the adequation of things and intellect    which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli              Aquinas also restated the theory as   A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality       Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as  objective reality  and then representing it in thoughts  words and other symbols      Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors         For example  language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages  The German word Zeitgeist is one such example  one who speaks or understands the language may  know  what it means  but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning  this is a problem with many abstract words  especially those derived in agglutinative languages   Thus  some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate truth predicate  Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is Alfred Tarski  whose semantic theory is summarized further below in this article      Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis  such as interpersonal power struggles  community interactions  personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth   Coherence edit  Main article  Coherence theory of truth  Walter Seymour Allward s Veritas  Truth  outside Supreme Court of Canada  Ottawa  Ontario Canada For coherence theories in general  truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system  Very often  though  coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency  often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other  So  for example  the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system       A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions  and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole   Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory  theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system  Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of formal systems in logic and mathematics       However  formal reasoners are content to contemplate axiomatically independent and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side  for example  the various alternative geometries  On the whole  coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth  especially with respect to assertions about the natural world  empirical data in general  assertions about practical matters of psychology and society  especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth      Coherence theories distinguish the thought of rationalist philosophers  particularly of Baruch Spinoza  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  along with the British philosopher F  H  Bradley       They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of logical positivism  notably Otto Neurath and Carl Hempel   Pragmatic edit  Main article  Pragmatic theory of truth The three most influential forms of the pragmatic theory of truth were introduced around the turn of the   th century by Charles Sanders Peirce  William James  and John Dewey   Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory  they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one s concepts into practice      Peirce defines truth as follows    Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief  which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one sidedness  and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth        This statement stresses Peirce s view that ideas of approximation  incompleteness  and partiality  what he describes elsewhere as fallibilism and  reference to the future   are essential to a proper conception of truth   Although Peirce uses words like concordance and correspondence to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation  he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than nominal definitions  which he accords a lower status than real definitions  William James s version of pragmatic theory  while complex  is often summarized by his statement that  the  true  is only the expedient in our way of thinking  just as the  right  is only the expedient in our way of behaving        By this  James meant that truth is a quality  the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice  thus   pragmatic    John Dewey  less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce  held that inquiry  whether scientific  technical  sociological  philosophical or cultural  is self corrective over time if  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify  justify  refine and or refute proposed truths      Though not widely known  a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the   th century forward  Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking  this variation is known as  negative pragmatism    Essentially  what works may or may not be true  but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works      Richard Feynman also ascribed to it   We never are definitely right  we can only be sure we are wrong       This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce  James  and Dewey   For Peirce  the idea of      endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief      fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing   As Feynman noted  an idea or theory      could never be proved right  because tomorrow s experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right        Similarly  James and Dewey s ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is  self corrective  over time  Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the coherence theory of truth in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience   The universe is a whole and integrated system  and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity   As Feynman said       if it disagrees with experiment  it is wrong        Constructivist edit  Main article  Constructivist epistemology Social constructivism holds that truth is constructed by social processes  is historically and culturally specific  and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community  Constructivism views all of our knowledge as  constructed   because it does not reflect any external  transcendent  realities  as a pure correspondence theory might hold    Rather  perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention  human perception  and social experience  It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality  including race  sexuality  and gender  are socially constructed  Giambattista Vico was among the first to claim that history and culture were man made  Vico s epistemological orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom verum ipsum factum  truth itself is constructed   Hegel and Marx were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is  or can be  socially constructed  Marx  like many critical theorists who followed  did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology  For Marx  scientific and true knowledge is  in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history  and ideological knowledge is  an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement       page needed   Consensus edit  Main article  Consensus theory of truth Consensus theory holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon  or in some versions  might come to be agreed upon  by some specified group  Such a group might include all human beings  or a subset thereof consisting of more than one person  Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of  truth  is the philosopher J rgen Habermas      Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation      Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher Nicholas Rescher      In the Islamic tradition  this principle is exemplified by the hadith in which Muhammad states   My community will never agree upon an error       Minimalist edit  Deflationary edit  Main article  Deflationary theory of truth Modern developments in the field of philosophy have resulted in the rise of a new thesis  that the term truth does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions  This thesis is in part a response to the common use of truth predicates  e g   that some particular thing     is true   which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the   th century   From this point of view  to assert that              is true  is logically equivalent to asserting that              and the phrase  is true  is completely dispensable in this and every other context  In common parlance  truth predicates are not commonly heard  and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true  Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described   as deflationary theories of truth  since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words  true  or truth  as disquotational theories  to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example  or as minimalist theories of truth         Whichever term is used  deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that   t he predicate  true  is an expressive convenience  not the name of a property requiring deep analysis      Once we have identified the truth predicate s formal features and utility  deflationists argue  we have said all there is to be said about truth  Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it does appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties   See  e g   Semantic paradoxes  and below   In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate  is true   some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences  For example  one cannot express confidence in Michael s accuracy by asserting the endless sentence   Michael says   snow is white  and snow is white  or he says  roses are red  and roses are red or he says     etc  This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying  What Michael says is true       Performative edit  Attributed to P  F  Strawson is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say   Snow is white  is true  is to perform the speech act of signaling one s agreement with the claim that snow is white  much like nodding one s head in agreement   The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem  Consider  for example  that when the wedding couple say  I do  at the appropriate time in a wedding  they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse  They are not describing themselves as taking the other  but actually doing so  perhaps the most thorough analysis of such  illocutionary acts  is J  L  Austin   How to Do Things With Words        Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts  not just illocutionary ones   To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement  but rather to perform the act of agreeing with  accepting  or endorsing a statement   When one says  It s true that it s raining   one asserts no more than  It s raining    The function of  the statement   It s true that     is to agree with  accept  or endorse the statement that  it s raining         Redundancy and related edit  Main article  Redundancy theory of truth According to the redundancy theory of truth  asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself   For example  making the assertion that    Snow is white  is true  is equivalent to asserting  Snow is white    Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept  that is  it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing  generally for emphasis  but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality   This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P  Ramsey  who held that the use of words like fact and truth was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition  and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a  linguistic muddle              A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of Tarski s schema  To say that   P  is true  is to say that P   A version of this theory was defended by C  J  F  Williams in his book What is Truth   Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth  first developed by Dorothy Grover  Joseph Camp  and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey s claims   They argue that sentences like  That s true   when said in response to  It s raining   are prosentences  expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions   In the same way that it means the same as my dog in the sentence My dog was hungry  so I fed it  That s true is supposed to mean the same as It s raining if you say the latter and I then say the former   These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a property  but rather can be understood to say that  for instance  the assertion  P  may well involve a substantial truth  and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as  that s true      Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences  and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise   Consider the analogy between the sentence  Snow is white  and the character named Snow White  both of which can be true in some sense   To a minimalist  saying  Snow is white is true  is the same as saying  Snow is white   but to say  Snow White is true  is not the same as saying  Snow White    Philosophical skepticism edit  See also  Philosophical skepticism and Certainty Philosophical skepticism is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions          The primary target of philosophical skepticism is epistemology  but it can be applied to any domain  such as the supernatural  morality  moral skepticism   and religion  skepticism about the existence of God       Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms  Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters  More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty  or that we can know little or nothing about the  big questions  in life  such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife  Religious skepticism is  doubt concerning basic religious principles  such as immortality  providence  and revelation        Scientific skepticism concerns testing beliefs for reliability  by subjecting them to systematic investigation using the scientific method  to discover empirical evidence for them   Pluralist edit  Main article  Pluralist theories of truth Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true  Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true  ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence  Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about  Some of the pragmatic theories  such as those by Charles Peirce and William James  included aspects of correspondence  coherence and constructivist theories          Crispin Wright argued in his      book Truth and Objectivity that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate  In some discourses  Wright argued  the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility      Michael Lynch  in a      book Truth as One and Many  argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence       Most believed edit  According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November       taken by      respondents  including      philosophy faculty members and or PhDs and     philosophy graduate students      of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories      accept or lean towards deflationary theories and     epistemic theories       Formal theories edit   Truth  holding a mirror and a serpent         Olin Levi Warner  Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building  Washington  D C  Logic edit  Main articles  Logical truth  Criteria of truth  and Truth value Logic is concerned with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not  Logicians use formal languages to express the truths which they are concerned with  and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system  A logical truth  also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth  is a statement which is true in all possible worlds     or under all possible interpretations  as contrasted to a fact  also called a synthetic claim or a contingency  which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded  A proposition such as  If p and q  then p  is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world  They are such that they could not be untrue  Degrees of truth in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values  as with bivalent logic  or binary logic   three valued logic  and other forms of finite valued logic          Truth in logic can be represented using numbers comprising a continuous range  typically between   and    as with fuzzy logic and other forms of infinite valued logic          In general  the concept of representing truth using more than two values is known as many valued logic       Mathematics edit    Main articles  Model theory and Proof theory There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics   They are the model theory of truth and the proof theory of truth      Historically  with the nineteenth century development of Boolean algebra mathematical models of logic began to treat  truth   also represented as  T  or      as an arbitrary constant    Falsity  is also an arbitrary constant  which can be represented as  F  or       In propositional logic  these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of axioms and rules of inference  often given in the form of truth tables  In addition  from at least the time of Hilbert s program at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of G del s incompleteness theorems and the development of the Church Turing thesis in the early part of that century  true statements in mathematics were generally assumed to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system      The works of Kurt G del  Alan Turing  and others shook this assumption  with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system      Two examples of the latter can be found in Hilbert s problems  Work on Hilbert s   th problem led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific Diophantine equations for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution      or even if they do  whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions  More fundamentally  Hilbert s first problem was on the continuum hypothesis      G del and Paul Cohen showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory      In the view of some  then  it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom  G del thought that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of intuition  an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics         and perhaps best considered in the realm of human comprehension and communication  but commented   The more I think about language  the more it amazes me that people ever understand each other at all      Tarski s semantics edit  Main articles  Semantic theory of truth and Tarski s theory of truth The semantic theory of truth has as its general case for a given language    P  is true if and only if P where  P  refers to the sentence  the sentence s name   and P is just the sentence itself  Tarski s theory of truth  named after Alfred Tarski  was developed for formal languages  such as formal logic  Here he restricted it in this way  no language could contain its own truth predicate  that is  the expression is true could only apply to sentences in some other language  The latter he called an object language  the language being talked about   It may  in turn  have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language   The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences such as   This sentence is not true   As a result  Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language  such as English  because they contain their own truth predicates  Donald Davidson used it as the foundation of his truth conditional semantics and linked it to radical interpretation in a form of coherentism  Bertrand Russell is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day  in particular the paradox that came to be named after him  Russell s paradox  Russell and Whitehead attempted to solve these problems in Principia Mathematica by putting statements into a hierarchy of types  wherein a statement cannot refer to itself  but only to statements lower in the hierarchy   This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible type systems that have yet to be resolved to this day   Kripke s semantics edit  Main article  Kripke s theory of truth Kripke s theory of truth  named after Saul Kripke  contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction  He showed how to construct one as follows   Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression  is true   or  is false    So The barn is big is included in the subset  but not   The barn is big is true   nor problematic sentences such as  This sentence is false   Define truth just for the sentences in that subset  Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences  So  The barn is big is true  is now included  but not either  This sentence is false  nor   The barn is big is true  is true   Next  define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set  Imagine this process repeated infinitely  so that truth is defined for The barn is big  then for  The barn is big is true   then for   The barn is big is true  is true   and so on  Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like This sentence is false  since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set  In Kripke s terms  these are  ungrounded   Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely  Kripke s theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false  This contradicts the principle of bivalence  every sentence must be either true or false  Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the liar paradox  the paradox is dissolved      However  it has been shown by G del that self reference cannot be avoided naively  since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self referential meaning  in G del s work  these objects are integer numbers  and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions  In fact  this idea manifested by the diagonal lemma is the basis for Tarski s theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined  It has thus been claimed     that Kripke s system indeed leads to contradiction  while its truth predicate is only partial  it does give truth value  true false  to propositions such as the one built in Tarski s proof  and is therefore inconsistent  While there is still a debate on whether Tarski s proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system  none have been shown to be consistent by acceptable methods used in mathematical logic   Folk beliefs edit  The truth predicate  P is true  has great practical value in human language  allowing us to efficiently endorse or impeach claims made by others  to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement  or to enable various indirect  Gricean  conversational implications      Individuals or societies will sometime punish  false  statements to deter falsehoods      the oldest surviving law text  the Code of Ur Nammu  lists penalties for false accusations of sorcery or adultery  as well as for committing perjury in court  Even four year old children can pass simple  false belief  tests and successfully assess that another individual s belief diverges from reality in a specific way      by adulthood we have strong implicit intuitions about  truth  that form a  folk theory  of truth  These intuitions include       Capture  T in   If P  then P is true Release  T out   If P is true  then P Noncontradiction  A statement can t be both true and false Normativity  It is usually good to believe what is true False beliefs  The notion that believing a statement doesn t necessarily make it true Like many folk theories  our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but  upon deep analysis  turns out to be technically self contradictory  in particular  any formal system that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth  also known as the T schema   and that also respects classical logic  is provably inconsistent and succumbs to the liar paradox or to a similar contradiction       Notable views edit   La V rit   Truth  by Jules Joseph Lefebvre Ancient philosophy edit  Ancient Greece edit  Socratic philosophy edit  Socrates   Plato s and Aristotle s ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory  In his Metaphysics  Aristotle stated    To say of what is that it is not  or of what is not that it is  is false  while to say of what is that it is  and of what is not that it is not  is true       The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy proceeds to say of Aristotle         Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the Categories    b      b     where he talks of  underlying things  that make statements true and implies that these  things   pragmata  are logically structured situations or facts  viz   his sitting  his not sitting   Most influential is his claim in De Interpretatione    a   that thoughts are  likenesses   homoiosis  of things  Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought s likeness to a thing or fact  it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind            Similar statements can also be found in Plato s dialogues  Cratylus    b   Sophist    b       The Stoics conceived truth as accessible from impressions via cognitive grasping   Non Socratic philosophy edit  Many other Greek philosophers maintained that truth was either not accessible to mortals  or of greatly limited accessibility  forming early philosophical skepticism  Among these were Xenophanes  Democritus  and Pyrrho   Medieval philosophy edit  Avicenna            edit  In early Islamic philosophy  Avicenna  Ibn Sina  defined truth in his work Kitab Al Shifa The Book of Healing  Book I  Chapter    as   What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it      Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII  Chapter     The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it      However  this definition is merely a rendering of the medieval Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet      A modern translation of the original Arabic text states   Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence  of something       Aquinas             edit  Reevaluating Avicenna  and also Augustine and Aristotle  Thomas Aquinas stated in his Disputed Questions on Truth   A natural thing  being placed between two intellects  is called true insofar as it conforms to either  It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect    With respect to its conformity with a human intellect  a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself      Thus  for Aquinas  the truth of the human intellect  logical truth  is based on the truth in things  ontological truth       Following this  he wrote an elegant re statement of Aristotle s view in his Summa I        Veritas est ad quatio intellectus et rei    Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things    Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the Creator God who is Subsistent Being  Intelligence  and Truth  Thus  these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable  These things  beings  reality  are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind  when it acquires knowledge of things  first through the senses  then through the understanding and the judgement done by reason  For Aquinas  human intelligence   intus   within and  legere   to read  has the capability to reach the essence and existence of things because it has a non material  spiritual element  although some moral  educational  and other elements might interfere with its capability  Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages edit  Richard Firth Green examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his A Crisis of Truth  and concludes that roughly during the reign of Richard II of England the very meaning of the concept changes  The idea of the oath  which was so much part and parcel of for instance Romance literature      changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one  in Derek Pearsall s summary       Whereas truth  the  trouthe  of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight  was first  an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons   in Ricardian England it  transforms   into a political truth in which truth is understood to reside in documents        Modern philosophy edit  Kant             edit   Immanuel Kant Immanuel Kant endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth      Kant writes in the Critique of Pure Reason   The nominal definition of truth  namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object  is here granted and presupposed       However  Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true  Kant states in his logic lectures         Truth  it is said  consists in the agreement of cognition with its object  In consequence of this mere nominal definition  my cognition  to count as true  is supposed to agree with its object  Now I can compare the object with my cognition  however  only by cognizing it  Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself  which is far short of being sufficient for truth  For since the object is outside me  the cognition in me  all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object  The ancients called such a circle in explanation a diallelon  And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics  who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted  but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man  The accusation was grounded  too  Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man            This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions  A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression  A real definition describes the essence of certain objects and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition      Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and  therefore  we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true  According to Kant  the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that  by means of a merely nominal definition of truth  they can establish which judgements are true  They were trying to do something that is  impossible without qualification and for every man        Hegel             edit  Georg Hegel distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self moving object instead of being related to inner  subjective thoughts  Hegel s truth is analogous to the mechanics of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force   Truth is its own self movement within itself       Teleological truth moves itself in the three step form of dialectical triplicity toward the final goal of perfect  final  absolute truth  According to Hegel  the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth  Chalyb us used the terms  thesis    antithesis   and  synthesis  to describe Hegel s dialectical triplicity   The  thesis  consists of an incomplete historical movement  To resolve the incompletion  an  antithesis  occurs which opposes the  thesis   In turn  the  synthesis  appears when the  thesis  and  antithesis  become reconciled and a higher level of truth is obtained  This  synthesis  thereby becomes a  thesis   which will again necessitate an  antithesis   requiring a new  synthesis  until a final state is reached as the result of reason s historical movement  History is the Absolute Spirit moving toward a goal  This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history  Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite God   Schopenhauer             edit  For Arthur Schopenhauer      a judgment is a combination or separation of two or more concepts  If a judgment is to be an expression of knowledge  it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true  Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason  ground   Judgments can have material  formal  transcendental  or metalogical truth  A judgment has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations  If a judgment has its reason  ground  in another judgment  its truth is called logical or formal  If a judgment  of  for example  pure mathematics or pure science  is based on the forms  space  time  causality  of intuitive  empirical knowledge  then the judgment has transcendental truth   Kierkegaard             edit  When S ren Kierkegaard  as his character Johannes Climacus  ends his writings  My thesis was  subjectivity  heartfelt is the truth  he does not advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form  the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so   but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person s life  Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person s being  while subjective truths are concerned with a person s way of being  Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics  science  and history are relevant and necessary  but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person s inner relationship to existence  At best  these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one s actual experience of life      While objective truths are final and static  subjective truths are continuing and dynamic  The truth of one s existence is a living  inward  and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming  The values  morals  and spiritual approaches a person adopts  while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs  can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience  Thus  Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality  As Kierkegaard claims  human truth is something that is continually occurring  and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one s own existing  defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one s way of life       Nietzsche             edit  Friedrich Nietzsche believed the search for truth  or  the will to truth   was a consequence of the will to power of philosophers  He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the will to power  and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence  As he wrote in Beyond Good and Evil   The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment    The question is to what extent it is life advancing  life preserving  species preserving  perhaps even species breeding      aphorism     He proposed the will to power as a truth only because  according to him  it was the most life affirming and sincere perspective one could have  Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche s basic view of truth as follows         Some scholars regard Nietzsche s      unpublished essay   On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense     ber Wahrheit und L ge im au ermoralischen Sinn   as a keystone in his thought  In this essay  Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants  and claims that what we call  truth  is only  a mobile army of metaphors  metonyms  and anthropomorphisms   His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience  concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images   truth  is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes  especially those of repose  security and consistence            Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient  metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition   But you will have gathered what I am getting at  namely  that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests that even we knowers of today  we godless anti metaphysicians still take our fire too  from the flame lit by the thousand year old faith  the Christian faith which was also Plato s faith  that God is Truth  that Truth is  Divine               Heidegger             edit  Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative  According to Martin Heidegger  the original meaning and essence of truth in Ancient Greece was unconcealment  or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open  as indicated by the original Greek term for truth  aletheia          On this view  the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept s original essence  a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term veritas   Whitehead             edit  Alfred North Whitehead  a British mathematician who became an American philosopher  said   There are no whole truths  all truths are half truths  It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil       The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie  since half truths are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion   Peirce             edit  Pragmatists like C  S  Peirce take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and discovering truth  with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human inquiry would find out on a matter  if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go   The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate  is what we mean by the truth          Nishida             edit  According to Kitaro Nishida   knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again  Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing  of truth  that directs knowing  the willing that directs action  and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing        Fromm             edit  Erich Fromm finds that trying to discuss truth as  absolute truth  is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on  optimal truth   He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one s environment physically and intellectually  whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in  a strange and powerful world   The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment  Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality  His vision of optimal truth is described partly in  Man from Himself  An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics          from which excerpts are included below   the dichotomy between  absolute   perfect  and  relative   imperfect  has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought  where  it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles   In that respect   a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result   The history of science is  a history of inadequate and incomplete statements  and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation   As a result  the history of thought is the history of an ever increasing approximation to the truth  Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal  it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period   Fromm furthermore notes that  different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth  and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate  increasing further the approximation to the truth  Foucault             edit   Quid Est Veritas  Christ and Pilate  by Nikolai Ge  Truth  says Michel Foucault  is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an  objective  quality   He prefers not to use the term truth itself but  Regimes of Truth    In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of  or embedded within  a given power structure   Thus Foucault s view shares much in common with the concepts of Nietzsche   Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various episteme throughout history       Baudrillard             edit  Jean Baudrillard considered truth to be largely simulated  that is pretending to have something  as opposed to dissimulation  pretending to not have something   He took his cue from iconoclasts whom he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist      Baudrillard wrote in  Precession of the Simulacra    The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth it is the truth which conceals that there is none   The simulacrum is true   Ecclesiastes           Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were  that prisons simulate the  truth  that society is free  scandals  e g   Watergate  simulate that corruption is corrected  Disney simulates that the U S  itself is an adult place  One must remember that though such examples seem extreme  such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard s theory  For a less extreme example  consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished  humiliated  or otherwise failing  thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily  a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate       Other contemporary positions edit  Truthmaker theory is  the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists        It is different from substantive theories of truth in the sense that it doesn t aim at giving a definition of what truth is  Instead  it has the goal of determining how truth depends on being        Theological views edit  Hinduism edit  In Hinduism  Truth is defined as  unchangeable    that which has no distortion    that which is beyond distinctions of time  space  and person    that which pervades the universe in all its constancy   The human body  therefore is not completely true as it changes with time  for example  There are many references  properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth  such as the national motto of India   Satyameva Jayate   Truth alone wins   as well as  Satyam muktaye   Truth liberates    Satya  is  Parahit artham  va unmanaso yatha rthatvam  satyam   Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too    When one is firmly established in speaking truth  the fruits of action become subservient to him  patanjali yogasutras  sutra number         The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl  Unveil it  O Pusan  Sun   so that I who have truth as my duty  satyadharma  may see it    Brhadaranyaka V        and the brief IIsa Upanisad         Truth is superior to silence  Manusmriti   etc  Combined with other words  satya acts as modifier  like  ultra  or  highest   or more literally  truest   connoting purity and excellence  For example  satyaloka is the  highest heaven  and Satya Yuga is the  golden age  or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism  and so on   Buddhism edit  In Buddhism  particularly in the Mahayana tradition  the notion of truth is often divided into the Two Truths Doctrine  which consists of relative or conventional truth and ultimate truth  The former refers to truth that is based on common understanding among ordinary people and is accepted as a practical basis for communication of higher truths  Ultimate truth necessarily transcends logic in the sphere of ordinary experience  and recognizes such phenomena as illusory  M dhyamaka philosophy asserts that any doctrine can be analyzed with both divisions of truth  Affirmation and negation belong to relative and absolute truth respectively  Political law is regarded as relative  while religious law is absolute    Christianity edit  Christianity has a soteriological view of truth  According to the Bible in John       Jesus is quoted as having said  I am the way  the truth and the life  no man cometh unto the Father  but by me    See also edit    Philosophy portal Psychology portal  Asha Belief Confirmation holism
