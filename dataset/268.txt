meaning  palace  or  mansion   from Persian sar y        of the same meaning   academia is split on the origin of the evo attached to the end  One theory is that it may come from the Ottoman Turkish term saray ovas   first recorded in           meaning  the plains around the palace  or simply  palace plains       However  in his Dictionary of Turkish loanwords  Abdulah  kalji  maintains that the evo ending is more likely to have come from the widespread Slavic suffix evo used to indicate place names  than from the Turkish ending ova      The first mention of name Sarajevo was in      letter written by Firuz Bey      The official name during the     years of Ottoman rule was Saraybosna   Palace of Bosnia    which remains the city s name in Modern Turkish  Sarajevo has had many nicknames  The earliest is  eher  the term Isa Beg Ishakovi  used to describe the town he was going to build which is Turkish for  city    ehir   in turn coming from the Persian shahr       meaning  city    As Sarajevo developed  numerous nicknames came from comparisons to other cities in the Islamic world  i e   Damascus of the North  and  European Jerusalem   the latter being the most popular

situated     meters        ft  above sea level and lies in the Sarajevo valley  in the middle of the Dinaric Alps      The valley itself once formed a vast expanse of greenery  but gave way to urban expansion and development in the post World War II era  The city is surrounded by heavily forested hills and five major mountains  The highest of the surrounding peaks is Treskavica at       meters

edit  Main article  Stari Grad  Sarajevo  Neolithic period Butmir vase One of the earliest findings of settlement in the Sarajevo area is that of the Neolithic Butmir culture  The discoveries at Butmir were made on the grounds of the modern day Sarajevo suburb Ilid a in      by Austro Hungarian authorities during the construction of an agricultural school  The area s richness in flint was attractive to Neolithic humans  and the settlement flourished  The settlement developed unique ceramics and pottery designs  which characterize the Butmir people as a unique culture  as described at the International Congress of Archaeologists and Anthropologists meeting in Sarajevo in           The next prominent culture in Sarajevo were the Illyrians  The ancient people  who considered most of the West Balkans as their homeland  had several key settlements in the region  mostly around the river Miljacka and the Sarajevo valley  The Illyrians in the Sarajevo region belonged to the Daesitiates  the last Illyrian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina to resist Roman occupation  Their defeat by the Roman emperor Tiberius in   AD marks the start of Roman rule in the region  The Romans never built up the region of modern day Bosnia  but the Roman colony of Aquae Sulphurae was near the top of present day Ilid a  and was the most important settlement of the time      After the Romans  the Goths settled the area  followed by the Slavs in the  th century       Middle Ages edit  See also  Sarajevo during the Middle Ages  Roman bridge erected      at Ilid a built of remnants of an old Roman settlement During the Middle Ages Sarajevo was part of the Bosnian province of Vrhbosna near the traditional center of the Kingdom of Bosnia  Though a city named Vrhbosna existed  the exact settlement in Sarajevo at this time is debated  Various documents note a place called Tornik in the region  most likely in the area of Marijin Dvor neighborhood  By all indications  Tornik was a very small marketplace surrounded by a proportionally small village  and was not considered very important by Ragusan merchants  Other scholars say that Vrhbosna was a major town in the wider area of modern day Sarajevo  Papal documents say that in       a cathedral dedicated to Saint Paul was built in the area  Disciples of the notable saints Cyril and Methodius stopped in the region  founding a church near Vrelo Bosna  Whether or not the town was somewhere in the area of modern day Sarajevo  the documents attest to its and the region s importance  There was also a citadel Hodidjed north east to Old City  dating from around      until it was occupied by the Ottoman Empire in            Ottoman era edit  See also  Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine  The Sebilj is a pseudo Ottoman style wooden fountain in the centre of Ba  ar ija square  Sarajevo was founded by the Ottoman Empire in the     s upon its conquest of the region  with      used as the city s founding date  The first Ottoman governor of Bosnia  Isa Beg Ishakovi   transformed the cluster of villages into a city and state capital by building a number of key structures  including a mosque  a closed marketplace  a public bath  a hostel  and of course the governor s castle   Saray   which gave the city its present name  The mosque was named  Careva D amija   the Tsar s Mosque  in honor of the Sultan Mehmed II  With the improvements  Sarajevo quickly grew into the largest city in the region  By the   th century the settlement was established as a city  named Bosna Saraj  around the citadel in       Following the expulsion of Jews from Spain at the end of the   th century  and the invitation from the Ottoman Empire to resettle their population  Sephardic Jews arrived in Sarajevo  which over time would become a leading center of Sephardic culture and the Ladino language  Though relatively small in size  a Jewish quarter would develop over several blocks in Ba  ar ija  Many local Christians converted to Islam at this time  To accommodate the new pilgrims on the road to Mecca  in      Gazi Husrev beg s quartermaster Vekil Harrach built a Pilgrim s mosque for which it is still known to this day Had ijska mosque  Under leaders such as the second governor Gazi Husrev beg  Sarajevo grew at a rapid rate  Husrev beg greatly shaped the physical city  as most of what is now the Old Town was built during his reign  Sarajevo became known for its large marketplace and numerous mosques  which by the middle of the   th century numbered more than      At the peak of the empire  Sarajevo was the biggest and most important Ottoman city in the Balkans after Istanbul  citation needed  By       the population of Sarajevo was estimated to be over         citation needed  By contrast  Belgrade in      had              and Zagreb as late as      had        people  As political conditions changed  Sarajevo became the site of warfare  In       during the Great Turkish War  a raid was led by Prince Eugene of Savoy of the Habsburg Monarchy against the Ottoman Empire  which conquered Sarajevo and left it plague infected and burned to the ground  After his men had looted thoroughly  they set the city on fire and destroyed nearly all of it in one day  Only a handful of neighborhoods  some mosques  and an Orthodox church  were left standing  Numerous other fires weakened the city  which was later rebuilt but never fully recovered from the destruction  By       it had only some        residents  citation needed  In the     s  several battles of the Bosnian uprising had taken place around the city  These had been led by Husein Grada  evi   Today  a major city street is named Zmaj od Bosne  Dragon of Bosnia  in his honor  The rebellion failed and for several more decades  the Ottoman state remained in control of Bosnia  The Ottoman Empire made Sarajevo an important administrative centre by       Ba  ar ija became the central commercial district and cultural center of the city in the

Herzegovina came in      as part of the Treaty of Berlin  and complete annexation followed in       angering the Serbs  Sarajevo was industrialized by Austria Hungary  who used the city as a testing area for new inventions such as tramways  which were established in      before they were later installed in Vienna  Architects and engineers wanting to help rebuild Sarajevo as a modern European capital rushed to the city  A fire that burned down a large part of the central city area   ar ija  left more room for redevelopment  As a result  the city has a unique blend of the remaining Ottoman city market and contemporary western architecture  Sarajevo also has some examples of Secession  and Pseudo Moorish styles that date from this period  The Austro Hungarian period was one of great development for the city  as the Western power brought its new acquisition up to the standards of the Victorian age  Various factories and other buildings were built at this time      and a large number of institutions were both Westernized and modernized  For the first time in history  Sarajevo s population began writing in Latin script          For the first time in centuries  the city significantly expanded outside its traditional borders  Much of the city s contemporary central municipality  Centar  was constructed during this period  Architecture in Sarajevo quickly developed into a wide range of styles and buildings  The Cathedral of Sacred Heart  for example  was constructed using elements of neo gothic and Romanesque architecture  The National Museum  Sarajevo brewery  and City Hall were also constructed during this period  Additionally  Austrian officials made Sarajevo the first city in this part of Europe to have a tramway  Although the Bosnia Vilayet de jure remained part of the Ottoman Empire  it was de facto governed as an integral part of Austria Hungary with the Ottomans having no say in its day to day governance  This lasted until      when the territory was formally annexed and turned into a condominium  jointly controlled by both Austrian Cisleithania and Hungarian Transleithania  In the event that triggered World War I  the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated  along with his wife Sophie  Duchess of Hohenberg in Sarajevo on    June      by Gavrilo Princip  a Bosnian and self declared Yugoslav  and member of Young Bosnia      This was followed by the Anti Serb riots in Sarajevo  which resulted in two deaths and destruction of property  In the ensuing war  however  most of the Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade  and Sarajevo largely escaped damage and destruction  Following the war  Bosnia was annexed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia  and Sarajevo became the capital of the Drina Province    Architecture from

alongside rebelling Slavic nations in Austria Hungary  Sarajevo became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia  Though it held some political significance as the center of first the Bosnian region and then the Drinska Banovina  the city was no longer a national capital and saw a decline in global influence      During World War II the Kingdom of Yugoslavia s army was overrun by German and Italian forces  Following a German bombing campaign  Sarajevo was captured on    April      by the   th Motorized infantry Division  The Axis powers created the Independent State of Croatia and included Sarajevo in its territory  Immediately following the occupation  the main Sephardi Jewish synagogue  Il Kal Grande  was looted  burned  and destroyed by the Nazis  Within a matter of months  the centuries old Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jewish communities of Sarajevo  comprising the vast majority of Bosnian Jewry  would be rounded up in the Old Synagogue  Stari hram  and deported to their deaths in Croatian concentration camps  Roughly     of Bosnia s Jewish population would perish at the hands of the Nazis and the Usta e during the Holocaust in the region  The Sarajevo Haggadah was the most important artifact which survived this period  smuggled out of Sarajevo and saved from the Nazis and Usta e by the chief librarian of the National Museum  Dervi  Korkut  On    October       a group of     notable Bosniak citizens of Sarajevo signed the Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims by which they condemned the Genocide of Serbs organized by the Usta e  made a distinction between the Bosniaks who participated in such persecutions and the rest of the Bosniak population  presented information about the persecutions of Bosniaks by Serbs  and requested security for all citizens of the country  regardless of their identity      During the summer of       Ustashe militia periodically interned and executed groups of Sarajevo Serbs      In August       they arrested about one hundred Serbs suspected of ties to the resistance armies  mostly church officials and members of the intelligentsia  and executed them or deported them to concentration camps      By mid summer       around        Serbs found refuge in Sarajevo from Usta e terror      The city was bombed by the Allies from      to           The Yugoslav Partisan movement was represented in the city  In the period February May       Maks Luburi  set up Usta e headquarters in a building known as Villa Luburi  and used it as torture and execution place whose     victims were identified after the war  Resistance was led by Vladimir  Walter  Peri   who died while leading the liberation of the city on   April       After the war  Sarajevo was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  The Republic Government invested heavily in Sarajevo  building many new residential blocks in Novi Grad Municipality and Novo Sarajevo Municipality  while simultaneously developing the city s industry and transforming Sarajevo into a modern city  Sarajevo grew rapidly as it became an important regional industrial center in Yugoslavia  Between the end of
