contractor  and early American television shows  Movies are usually copied directly from film reels  damaged reels from the catalogue are often replaced by donations  either from online  viewers or available libraries     One of the aims of the founders was to maintain the history of British cinema  it was said to have been in the making since          Older movies including those made in black and white were once regularly shown on terrestrial channels  such as BBC and Channel       but had declined by the     s  with only the best known classic films occasionally getting aired  Cronin Stanley explained to the Watford Observer in      that  People were interested in the big titles but he  her father Noel  wanted to save the smaller  more obscure titles  from getting lost      However  television networks rejected their pitches  unconvinced that it would be of high demand     so they decided to set up the channel independently     Cronin Stanley later explained that the channel specialises in  the things people have forgotten       Sponsorship edit  Merchandise  Renown Pictures edit  For over    years  Cronin Stanley and Cronin have been patrons to a DVD membership

terms edit  The regulator Ofcom has warned the channel about the use of obsolete racial terms in its programming on a handful of occasions      including an episode of Granada Television s A Family at War  originally broadcast in the early     s  shown by TPTV in the hour just before the  pm watershed  and an uncensored interview with Joan Turner during her appearance on the talk show Tell Me Another       Cronin Stanley told The Times in February        Ofcom say we need to advise people before they watch something that it may contain outdated racial stereotyping  but I would say that s babysitting our audience       However  since late       warning notices have been displayed just before some programmes begin  stating  for example  that a programme  was made between      and       and that  Some viewers may be offended by the language and attitudes expressed by some characters     which reflect the time it was made    Shown before episodes of  Rumpole of the Bailey     See also
