World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan  New York City was destroyed during the terrorist attacks of September           after being struck by two hijacked commercial airliners  One World Trade Center  WTC     the North Tower  was hit at      a m  Eastern time and collapsed at       a m  Two World Trade Center  WTC     the South Tower  was hit at      a m  and collapsed at      a m  The resulting debris severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures  ultimately leading to the collapse of   World Trade Center at      p m  A total of       people were killed in the crashes  fires  and subsequent collapses  including       civilians      firefighters  and    law enforcement officers as well as all the passengers and crew on the airplanes  which included     civilians and the ten hijackers  In September       the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  published the results of its investigation into the collapse  The investigators did not find anything substandard in the design of the twin towers  noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced in buildings in the past  They determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses  finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns  causing them to bow and then to buckle  Once the upper section of the building began to move downwards  a total progressive collapse was unavoidable  The cleanup of the World Trade Center site involved round the clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars   Some surrounding structures that were not hit by the airplanes still sustained significant damage  requiring them to be torn down  Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the

Twin Towers were briefly the tallest buildings in the world  and at the time of the terrorist attacks they were still in the top five  One World Trade Center  WTC    the  North Tower  was  at       feet      m   six feet taller than Two World Trade Center  WTC    the  South Tower   which stood       ft      m  tall  At the time of the attacks only the then recently completed Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia and the Willis Tower  known then as the Sears Tower  in Chicago were taller     Built with a novel design that maximized interior space  the towers had a high strength to weight ratio as they utilized a new  framed tube  design that required    percent less steel than more traditional steel framed skyscrapers     In addition  atop WTC   stood a     ft      m  telecommunications antenna that was erected in      bringing the total height of that tower to       ft      m   though as a nonstructural addition  the antenna was not officially counted   Structural design See also  Construction of the World Trade Center  Diagram showing floor truss system and concrete floor over steel pans The towers were designed as framed tube structures  which provided tenants with open floor plans uninterrupted by columns or walls  The buildings were square and     ft     m  on each side but had chamfered   feet    inches       metres  corners making the exterior of each building roughly     ft     m  wide     Numerous  closely spaced perimeter columns provided much of the strength to the structure  along with gravity load shared with the steel box columns of the core     Above the tenth floor  there were    perimeter columns along each face of the building spaced   feet   inches       metres  on center     While the towers were square  the interior cores were rectangular and were supported with    columns that ran the full height of each tower     All of the elevators and stairwells were located in the core  leaving a large column free space between it and the perimeter that was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses     As the core was rectangular this created a long and short span distance to the perimeter columns   The floors consisted of   inch thick     cm  lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck     A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors with shear connections to the concrete slab for composite action     The trusses had a span of    feet     m  in the long span areas and    feet     m  in the short span area  The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns  and were therefore on     foot      m  centers  The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the perimeter side and a channel welded to interior box columns on the core side  The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers  which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants     The towers also incorporated a  hat truss  or  outrigger truss  located between the    th and    th floors  which consisted of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis     This truss system allowed optimized load redistribution of floor diaphragms between the perimeter and core  with improved performance between the different materials of flexible steel and rigid concrete allowing the moment frames to transfer sway into compression on the core  which also mostly supported the transmission tower  These trusses were installed in each building to support future transmission towers but only the north tower was ultimately fitted with one      Evaluations for aircraft impact  Aviation fueled fireball emerges from north side of WTC   immediately after impact  Smoke from fires can be seen coming from north side of WTC   at right  Though fire studies and even an analysis of the impacts of low speed jet aircraft impacts had been undertaken prior to their completion  the full scope of those studies no longer exists  Nevertheless  since fire had never before caused a skyscraper to collapse and aircraft impacts had been considered in their design  their destruction initially came as a surprise to some in the engineering community     The structural engineers working on the World Trade Center considered the possibility that an aircraft could crash into the building  In July       a B    bomber that was lost in the fog had crashed into the   th floor of the Empire State Building      A year later  a C   F Expeditor crashed into the    Wall Street building  Once again fog was believed to have the contributing factor in the collision     Leslie Robertson  one of the chief engineers working on the design of the World Trade Center  stated that he considered the scenario of the impact of a Boeing      which might be lost in the fog and flying at relatively low speeds while seeking to land at either JFK or Newark Airports     In an interview with the BBC two months after the building collapses  Robertson claimed that   with the      the fuel load was not considered in the design  I don t know how it could have been considered   In the interview  Robertson stated that the main difference between the design studies and the event that ultimately caused the towers to collapse was due to the velocity of the impact  which greatly increased the absorbed energy  and was never considered during the construction process      During their investigation into the collapse  the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  obtained a three page white paper that stated the buildings would survive an aircraft impact of a Boeing     or DC   flying at     miles per hour      km h       In       John Skilling  lead structural engineer for the WTC  during an interview conducted after the      World Trade Center bombing remarked   Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel  from the airplane  would dump into the building  There would be a horrendous fire  A lot of people would be killed   he said   The building structure would still be there       In its report  NIST stated that the technical ability to perform a rigorous simulation of aircraft impact and ensuing fires is a recent development  and that the technical capability for such analysis would have been quite limited in the     s       note    In their final report on the collapses  the NIST stated that they could find no documentation that examined the impact of a high speed jet nor that of a large scale fire fueled by aviation fuel       Fireproofing Up until the mid     s  the use of asbestos for fireproofing was widespread in the construction industry  However  in April       the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered contractors building the World Trade Center to stop the spraying of asbestos as an insulating material      After the      bombing  inspections found fireproofing to be deficient      Prior to the collapses  the owners of the towers  the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  were in the process of adding fireproofing  but had only been completed on    floors in   WTC  including all the floors affected by the aircraft impact and fires  and on    floors in   WTC  although none were directly affected by the aircraft impact      NIST concluded that the aircraft impact removed a significant portion of the fireproofing  contributing to the buildings  collapse  In WTC   the impact stripped the insulation off    of    core columns on more than one floor as well as floor trusses over a space of        square feet        m    In WTC   the impact removed insulation from    of the    columns on multiple floors and from floor trusses spanning an area of        sq ft        m        After the collapses  Leslie Robertson stated   To the best of our knowledge  little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft  and no designs were prepared for that circumstance  Indeed  at that time  no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires       September           Impact locations on   and   WTC showing approximate angle of impact and alignment of the cores with the exterior of each tower  Aircraft impacts and resultant fires During the September    attacks  four teams of al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four different jetliners  Two of these jetliners  American Airlines Flight    and United Airlines Flight      both Boeing    s  were hijacked after takeoff from Boston s Logan International Airport  In its final moments  American Airlines Flight    flew south over Manhattan and crashed at roughly     miles per hour      km h  into the north facade of the North Tower  WTC    at      am  impacting between the   rd and   th floors  Seventeen minutes later  United Airlines Flight     approached from the southwest  over New York Harbor  and crashed into the south facade of the South Tower  WTC    at      am between the   th and   th floors at     miles per hour      km h   In addition to severing numerous load bearing columns on the perimeter and inflicting other structural damage  the impacts ignited thousands of gallons of jet fuel  which in turn ignited office combustibles  About one third of the fuel was consumed in the initial impact and resulting fireball  note        Some fuel from the impact traveled down at least one elevator shaft and exploded on the   th floor of the North Tower  as well as in the main lobby      The light construction and hollow nature of the structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers  igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors  The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes  but the contents of the buildings burned over the next hour or hour and a half       Emergency response and evacuation See also  Casualties of the September    attacks and Emergency workers killed in the September    attacks Almost all the deaths in the Twin Towers occurred in the zones above the points of aircraft impact  As the North Tower had been struck directly midway into the structure  the three stairways in the tower core were all damaged or blocked by debris preventing escape to lower floors  In the South Tower  the impact was slightly off center to the central section of the tower and stairway A in the northwest portion of the central core was only partially blocked  and    to    civilians managed to escape from the point of aircraft impact and the floors above that  The exact numbers of who perished and where in some cases is not precisely known  however the National Institute of Standards and Technology report indicated that a total of       civilians perished at or above the impact point in the North Tower with hundreds estimated to have been killed at the moment of impact  In the South Tower      civilians perished at the impacted floors and the floors above that  Fewer than     of the civilian fatalities occurred in the floors below the impact points but all     civilian passengers and crew on the two aircraft as well as all    terrorists perished  along with at least    people on the ground and in adjacent structures      All told  emergency personnel killed in the collapse included     New York City Fire Department  FDNY   and    law enforcement officers including    members of the New York City Police Department  NYPD      members of the Port Authority Police Department  PAPD   five members of the New York State Office of Tax Enforcement  OTE   three officers of the New York State Office of Court Administration  OCA   one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department  FDNY  who had sworn law enforcement powers  and was also among the     FDNY members killed   one member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   and one member of the United States Secret Service  USSS   The total death toll for civilian and non civilians is estimated to be       persons   Collapse The destruction of the Twin Towers has been called  the most infamous paradigm  of progressive collapse     They began with the local failure of a few structural components and progressed to encompass the whole of the structure      Such collapses are characterized by  the separation of structural components  including non load bearing elements   the release of gravitational energy  and the occurrence of impact forces   The vertical impact force supplies the propagating action  the principal forces are parallel  and the primary load transfer is serial      The key element in the structure that failed was constituted by the combined  vertical load bearing members of one entire storey   Excepting the top floors of the building  which would not have released sufficient gravitational energy to bring about a total collapse  the collapses could have begun with the failure of any story      Under these conditions  the towers collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down  though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides  In both cases  the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed  which allowed the floors above the impact zone to fall onto the undamaged structure below  As the collapse progressed  dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction  caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels  During each collapse  large portions of the perimeter columns and possibly the cores were left without any lateral support  causing them to fall laterally towards the outside  pushed by the increasing pile of rubble  The result was that the walls peeled off and separated away from the buildings by a large distance  about     feet in some cases   hitting other neighboring buildings  and starting fires that would later lead to the collapse of Building    Some connections broke as the bolts snapped  leaving many panels randomly scattered      The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground    seconds after the collapse started  and parts of the South Tower after   seconds  The lower portions of both buildings  cores     stories of WTC   and    stories of WTC    remained standing for up to    seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed       Collapse initiation  Simple representation of the collapse of the North Tower After the planes struck the buildings  but before the buildings collapsed  the cores of both towers consisted of three distinct sections  Above and below the impact floors  the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes  the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating  The section between them  however  had sustained significant damage and  though they were not hot enough to melt it  the fires were weakening the structural steel  As a result  the core columns were slowly being crushed  sustaining plastic and creep deformation from the weight of floors above  As the top section tried to move downward  however  the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns  Meanwhile  the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by the heat of the fires  and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards   The ensuing loss in vertical load carrying capacity was confined to a few storeys but extended over the entire cross section of each tower       In the case of   WTC  the eastern face finally buckled  transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse  Later  the south wall of   WTC buckled in the same way  and with similar consequences       Total progressive collapse Structural systems respond very differently to static and dynamic loads and  while the towers were designed to support enormous weight under normal conditions  they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the section above the damaged floors  In both cases  the collapses began with the drop of the upper section through the height of at least one story  roughly three meters or ten feet   yet a fall of only half a meter  about    inches  would have released the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse      From there collapse proceeded through two phases  During the crush down phase  the upper block destroyed the structure below in a progressive series of column failures roughly one story at a time  Each failure began with the impact of the upper block on the columns of the lower section  mediated by a growing layer of rubble consisting mainly of concrete from the floor slabs  The energy from each impact was  reintroduced into the structure in  the  subsequent impact      concentrate d  in the load bearing elements directly affected by the impact       This buckled the columns of the story immediately beneath the advancing destruction down to the next point of lateral support  usually the floor trusses of the given story  After the columns buckled the block was once again unsupported and fell through the distance of that story  again impacting the columns of the story below  which then buckled in the same way  This repeated until the upper block reached the ground and the crush up phase began  Here  too  the columns buckled one story at a time  now starting from the bottom  As each story failed  the remaining block fell through the height of the story  onto the next one  which it also crushed  until the roof finally hit the ground     The process accelerated throughout  and by the end each story was being crushed in less than a tenth of a second       South Tower collapse Main article  World Trade Center              Aerial view of the site after the collapse  with locations of the collapsed buildings outlined As the fires continued to burn  occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to       dispatchers  At      a m   an occupant on the    th floor of the South Tower reported that floors beneath him  in the    something floor  had collapsed      The New York City Police Department aviation unit also relayed information about the deteriorating condition of the buildings to police commanders      Only    people escaped from above the impact zone of the South Tower after it was hit  including Stanley Praimnath  who saw the plane coming at him   and only four from the floors above it  They escaped via Stairwell A  the only stairwell which had been left intact after the impact  Numerous police hotline operators who received calls from individuals inside the South Tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded  Many operators told callers not to descend the tower on their own  even though it is now believed that Stairwell A was most likely passable at and above the point of impact      At      a m   the NYPD aviation unit reported over the radio that  large pieces may be falling from the top of WTC    Large pieces are hanging up there       With the warnings  the NYPD issued orders for its officers to evacuate  During the emergency response  there was minimal communication between the NYPD and the New York City Fire Department  FDNY   and overwhelmed       dispatchers did not pass along information to FDNY commanders on scene  At      a m   the South Tower collapsed     minutes after being struck   North Tower collapse After the South Tower collapsed  NYPD helicopters relayed information about the deteriorating conditions of the North Tower  At       a m   the NYPD aviation unit reported that  the top of the tower might be leaning   and a minute later reported that the North Tower   is buckling on the southwest corner and leaning to the south   At       a m   the aviation unit reported that  the roof is going to come down very shortly      and indeed  the North Tower collapsed immediately thereafter  at       a m   after burning for     minutes  After the South Tower collapsed  FDNY commanders issued orders for firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate  Due to radio communications problems  firefighters inside the towers did not hear the evacuation order from their supervisors on the scene  and most were unaware that the other tower had collapsed      Three hundred forty three firefighters died in the Twin Towers  as a result of the collapse of the buildings              No one was able to escape the North Tower from the impact zone or above  as all stairwells and elevator shafts on those floors were destroyed or blocked      After the collapse  light dust reached as far as the Empire State Building  located      miles       km  away   Building   collapse Main article    World Trade Center  Portions of the outer shell of the North Tower lean against the remains of   WTC which suffered massive damage when the North Tower collapsed  The remains of   WTC are at upper right As the North Tower collapsed  heavy debris hit   World Trade Center  causing damage to the south face of the building     and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon      Structural damage occurred to the southwest corner between Floors   and    and on the south facade between Floor    and the roof  other possible structural damage includes a large vertical gash near the center of the south facade between Floors    and         The building was equipped with a sprinkler system  but had many single point vulnerabilities for failure  the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps  rather than being a fully automatic system  the floor level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser  and the sprinkler system required some power for the fire pump to deliver water  Also  water pressure was low  with little or no water to feed sprinklers            Smoke from fires visible in WTC   at upper center before it collapsed  Some firefighters entered   World Trade Center to search the building  They attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire  but low water pressure hindered their efforts      Fires burned into the afternoon on the   th and   th floors of   World Trade Center  the flames visible on the east side of the building          During the afternoon  fire was also seen on floors                     and            In particular  the fires on floors   through   and    through    continued to burn out of control during the afternoon      At approximately      pm  firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of   World Trade Center between the   th and   th floors  a sign that the building was unstable and might cave to one side or  collapse       During the afternoon  firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building and issued uncertain reports about damage in the basement      Around      pm FDNY Chief Daniel A  Nigro decided to halt rescue operations  surface removal  and searches along the surface of the debris near   World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel      At         pm EDT on September             World Trade Center started to collapse  with the crumble of the east mechanical penthouse  while at         pm EDT the entire building collapsed completely          There were no casualties associated with the collapse  When   World Trade Center collapsed  debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the Borough of Manhattan Community College s Fiterman Hall building  located adjacent at    West Broadway  to the extent that the building was not salvageable  In August       Fiterman Hall was scheduled for dismantling      A revised plan called for demolition in      and completion of the new Fiterman Hall in       at a cost of      million          The building was finally demolished in November      and construction of its replacement began on December              The adjacent Verizon Building  an Art Deco building constructed in       had extensive damage to its east facade from the collapse of   World Trade Center  though it was successfully restored at a cost of US     billion       Other buildings  The Sphere as seen    days after the attacks Many of the surrounding buildings were also either damaged or destroyed as the towers fell    WTC endured a large fire and a partial collapse of its steel structure and was torn down  Other buildings destroyed include St  Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church  Marriott World Trade Center  Marriott Hotel   WTC   South Plaza    WTC   and U S  Customs    WTC   The World Financial Center buildings     West Street  and     Cedar Street suffered fires   The Deutsche Bank Building  the Verizon Building  and World Financial Center   had impact damage from the towers  collapse      as did    West Street      One Liberty Plaza survived structurally intact but sustained surface damage including shattered windows     West Broadway was damaged by the collapse of   WTC  The Deutsche Bank Building  which was covered in a large black  shroud  after September    to cover the building s damage  was deconstructed because of water  mold  and other severe damage caused by the neighboring towers  collapse          Many works of art were destroyed in the collapse   Investigations Initial opinions and analysis  Impact locations for   WTC  right  and   WTC  left  In the immediate aftermath of the attacks  numerous structural engineers and experts spoke to the media  describing what they thought caused the towers to collapse  Abolhassan Astaneh Asl  a structural engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley  explained that the high temperatures in the fires weakened the steel beams and columns  causing them to become  soft and mushy   and eventually they were unable to support the structure above  Astaneh Asl also suggested that the fireproofing became dislodged during the initial aircraft impacts  He also explained that  once the initial structural failure occurred  progressive collapse of the entire structure was inevitable      C sar Pelli  who designed the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the World Financial Center in New York  remarked   no building is prepared for this kind of stress       On September           Zden k P  Ba ant  professor of civil engineering and materials science at Northwestern University  circulated a draft paper with results of a simple analysis of the World Trade Center collapse  Ba ant suggested that heat from the fires was a key factor  causing steel columns in both the core and the perimeter to weaken and experience deformation before losing their carrying capacity and buckling  Once more than half of the columns on a particular floor buckled  the overhead structure could no longer be supported and complete collapse of the structures occurred  Ba ant later published an expanded version of this analysis      Other analyses were conducted by MIT civil engineers Oral Buyukozturk and Franz Josef Ulm  who also described a collapse mechanism on September               They later contributed to an MIT collection of papers on the WTC collapses edited by Eduardo Kausel called The Towers Lost and Beyond      Immediately following the collapses  there was some confusion about who had the authority to carry out an official investigation  While there are clear procedures for the investigation of aircraft accidents  no agency had been appointed in advance to investigate building collapses      A team was quickly assembled by the Structural Engineers Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers  led by W  Gene Corley  Senior Vice President of CTLGroup  It also involved the American Institute of Steel Construction  the American Concrete Institute  the National Fire Protection Association  and the Society of Fire Protection Engineers      ASCE ultimately invited FEMA to join the investigation  which was completed under the auspices of the latter      The investigation was criticized by some engineers and lawmakers in the U S  It had little funding  no authority to demand evidence  and limited access to the WTC site  One major point of contention at the time was that the cleanup of the WTC site was resulting in the destruction of the majority of the buildings  steel components      Indeed  when NIST published its final report  it noted  the scarcity of physical evidence  that it had had at its disposal to investigate the collapses  Only a fraction of a percent of the buildings remained for analysis after the cleanup was completed  some     individual pieces of steel  although     of structural beams and plates and     of the reinforcement bars were recovered      FEMA published its report in May       While NIST had already announced its intention to investigate the collapses in August of the same year  by September           a year after the disaster   there was growing public pressure for a more thorough investigation      Congress passed the National Construction Safety Team bill in October       giving NIST the authority to conduct an investigation of the World Trade Center collapses       FEMA building performance study FEMA suggested that fires in conjunction with damage resulting from the aircraft impacts were the key to the collapse of the towers  Thomas Eagar  Professor of Materials Engineering and Engineering Systems at MIT  described the fires as  the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse   This is because the fires were originally said to have  melted  the floors and columns      Jet fuel is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large  but not unusually hot  hydrocarbon fires      As Eagar said   The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual  and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel       This led Eagar  FEMA and others to focus on what appeared to be the weakest point of the structures  namely  the points at which the floors were attached to the building frame       The large quantity of jet fuel carried by each aircraft ignited upon impact into each building  A significant portion of this fuel was consumed immediately in the ensuing fireballs  The remaining fuel is believed either to have flowed down through the buildings or to have burned off within a few minutes of the aircraft impact  The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses  However  as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings  it ignited much of the buildings  contents  causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings  The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station  Over a  period of many minutes  this heat induced additional stresses into the damaged structural frames while simultaneously softening and weakening these frames  This additional loading and the resulting damage were sufficient to induce the collapse of both structures      NIST report Main article  The NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation  The outer shell of the South Tower  tower    of the WTC is still standing at right  The    story Marriott Hotel in the foreground was crushed when both towers collapsed  After the FEMA report had been published  and following pressure from technical experts  industry leaders and families of victims  the Commerce Department s National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted a three year      million investigation into the structural failure and progressive collapse of several WTC complex structures      The study included in house technical expertise  along with assistance from several outside private institutions  including the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers  Society of Fire Protection Engineers  National Fire Protection Association  American Institute of Steel Construction  Simpson Gumpertz   Heger Inc   Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat  and the Structural Engineers Association of New York  The scope of the NIST investigation was focused on identifying  the sequence of events  that triggered the collapse  and did not include detailed analysis of the collapse mechanism itself  after the point at which events made the collapse inevitable               In line with the concerns of most engineers  NIST focused on the airplane impacts and the spread and effects of the fires  modeling these using the software program Fire Dynamics Simulator  NIST developed several highly detailed structural models for specific sub systems such as the floor trusses as well as a global model of the towers as a whole which is less detailed   These models are static or quasi static  including deformation but not the motion of structural elements after rupture as would dynamic models   So  the NIST models are useful for determining how the collapse was triggered  but do not shed light on events after that point  James Quintiere  professor of fire protection engineering at the University of Maryland  called the spoliation of the steel  a gross error  that NIST should have openly criticized      He also noted that the report lacked a timeline and physical evidence to support its conclusions      Some engineers have suggested that understanding of the collapse mechanism could be improved by developing an animated sequence of the collapses based on a global dynamic model  and comparing it with the video evidence of the actual collapses      The NIST report for WTC   concluded that no blast sounds were heard on audio and video footage  or were reported by witnesses         World Trade Center  Plan view of collapse progression  with structural failure initiating on lower floors  on the east side of the building and vertical progression up to the east mechanical penthouse In May       FEMA issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers under leadership of Dr  W  Gene Corley  P E  FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of   WTC and   WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting  The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation  citation needed  In response to FEMA s concerns  the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  was authorized to lead an investigation into the structural failure and collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers and   World Trade Center      The investigation  led by Dr S  Shyam Sunder  drew not only upon in house technical expertise  but also upon the knowledge of several outside private institutions  including the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers  SEI ASCE   the Society of Fire Protection Engineers  SFPE   the National Fire Protection Association  NFPA   the American Institute of Steel Construction  AISC   the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat  CTBUH   and the Structural Engineers Association of New York  SEAoNY       The bulk of the investigation of   World Trade Center was delayed until after reports were completed on the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers       In the meantime  NIST provided a preliminary report about   World Trade Center in June       and thereafter released occasional updates on the investigation      According to NIST  the investigation of   World Trade Center was delayed for a number of reasons  including that NIST staff who had been working on   World Trade Center were assigned full time from June      to September      to work on the investigation of the collapse of the twin towers       In June       Shyam Sunder explained   We are proceeding as quickly as possible while rigorously testing and evaluating a wide range of scenarios to reach the most definitive conclusion possible  The   WTC investigation is in some respects just as challenging  if not more so  than the study of the towers  However  the current study does benefit greatly from the significant technological advances achieved and lessons learned from our work on the towers           World Trade Center on fire after the collapse of the Twin Towers on September          In November       NIST released its final report on the causes of the collapse of   World Trade Center      This followed their August          draft report which included a period for public comments      In its investigation  NIST utilized ANSYS to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events      NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role  nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers  nor did the transfer elements  trusses  girders  and cantilever overhangs   But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor  The fires burned out of control during the afternoon  causing floor beams near Column    to expand and push a key girder off its seat  triggering the floors to fail around column    on Floors   to     With a loss of lateral support across nine floors  Column    soon buckled   pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it  With the buckling of these critical columns  the collapse then progressed east to west across the core  ultimately overloading the perimeter support  which buckled between Floors   and     causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit   From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building  NIST observed that the building s exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately   stories     meters  or     feet   noting  the collapse time was approximately    percent longer than that of free fall for the first    stories of descent       The fires  fueled by office contents  along with the lack of water  were the key reasons for the collapse      The collapse of the old   World Trade Center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires      Based on its investigation  NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers  and urged immediate action on a further recommendation  that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable  and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered  Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse  the main point of NIST s recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable       Other investigations In       Asif Usmani  Professor of Structural Engineering at University of Edinburgh  published a paper with two colleagues  They provisionally concluded the fires alone  without any damage from the airplanes  could have been enough to bring down the buildings  In their view  the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time      When the NIST report was published  Barbara Lane  with the UK engineering firm Arup  criticized its conclusion that the loss of fire proofing was a necessary factor in causing the collapses   We have carried out computer simulations which show that the towers would have collapsed after a major fire on three floors at once  even with fireproofing in place and without any damage from plane impact       Jose L  Torero  formerly of the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh  pursued further research into the potentially catastrophic effects of fire on real scale buildings               Aftermath Cleanup  A New York City fireman calls for    more rescue workers to make their way into the rubble of the World Trade Center  The cleanup was a massive operation coordinated by the City of New York Department of Design and Construction   On September     a preliminary cleanup plan was delivered by Controlled Demolition  Inc   CDI  of Phoenix  Maryland      Costing hundreds of millions of dollars  it involved round the clock operations with many contractors and subcontractors      By early November  with a third of the debris removed  officials began to reduce the number of firefighters and police officers assigned to recovering the remains of victims  in order to prioritize the removal of debris  This caused confrontations with firefighters      Despite efforts to extinguish the blaze  the large pile of debris burned for three months  until the majority of the rubble was finally removed from the site          In       the demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings was still ongoing as new construction proceeded on the World Trade Center s replacement    World Trade Center   Health effects Main articles  Health effects arising from the September    attacks and EPA      pollution controversy The collapse of the World Trade Center produced enormous clouds of dust that covered Manhattan for days   On September           the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   assured the public that the air in Manhattan was  safe to breathe       In      the EPA s inspector general found that the agency did not at that time have sufficient data to make such a statement  Dust from the collapse seriously reduced air quality and is likely the cause of many respiratory illnesses in lower Manhattan  Asbestosis is such an illness  and asbestos would have been present in the dust      Significant long term medical and psychological effects have been found among first responders including elevated levels of asthma  sinusitis  gastroesophageal reflux disease and posttraumatic stress disorder       Health effects also extended to residents  students  and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown       Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust  and the victims  names will be included in the World Trade Center memorial       More than        people have suffered from illnesses from the dust        References Explanatory notes     The three page white paper titled Salient points with regard to the structural design of The World Trade Center towers described an analysis of a Boeing     weighing         pounds      t  and carrying        US gallons     m   of fuel striking the   th floor of the buildings at     miles per hour      km h   It is unclear whether the effect of jet fuel and aircraft contents was a consideration in the original building design  but this study is in line with remarks Archived April           at the Wayback Machine made by John Skilling following the      WTC bombing  Without original documentation for either study  NIST said any further comments would amount to speculation  NIST       pp              According to National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  estimates  Flight    was carrying        US gallons         L  of jet fuel when it hit the North Tower        US gallons        L  were consumed in the initial impact when the aircraft hit and a similar amount was consumed in the fireball outside the building  Approximately       US gallons         L  burnt inside the office spaces igniting combustibles  Similarly  Flight     was carrying around       US gallons         L  when it hit the South Tower  Up to       US gallons        L  was instantly consumed in the initial fireball and up to       US gallons        L  was consumed in the fireball outside the building  More than       US gallons         L  was burnt in the office spaces  NIST estimated that each floor of both buildings contained around four pounds per square foot     tons per floor  of combustibles    Citations     History com Editors  July             One World Trade Center officially opens
