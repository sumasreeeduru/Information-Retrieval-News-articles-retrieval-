Imperial China  China s first emperor  Qin Shi Huang  is famed for having united the Warring States  walls to form the Great Wall of China  Most of the present structure  however  dates to the Ming dynasty  The Warring States period ended in     BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms  reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy  King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty  He enacted Qin s legalist reforms throughout China  notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters  measurements  road widths  i e   cart axles  length   and currency  His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi  Guangdong  and Vietnam      The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years  falling soon after the First Emperor s death  as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion          Following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at Xianyang was burned  u  the Han dynasty emerged to

decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism  Qin s legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors        Map showing the expansion of Han dynasty in the  nd century BC After the end of the Han dynasty  a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed      whose central figures

disabled emperor  the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States  The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei  whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors  apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects  largely integrating them into Chinese culture  In the south  the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song  The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties  with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in      The Sui restored the Han to power

China implemented a two child limit during the     s  and  in       began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family  Beginning in the mid     s  however  given the unpopularity of the strict limits  China began to allow some major exemptions  particularly in rural areas  resulting in what was actually a       child policy from the mid     s to       ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits   The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December       allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child       In       the one child policy was replaced in favor of a two child policy       Data from the      census implies that the total fertility rate may be around      although due to under reporting of births it may be closer to               According to one group of scholars  one child limits had little effect on population growth      or the size of the total population       However  these scholars have been challenged  Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than     million births between      and       a number which may reach one billion by      given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions  with one child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction       The policy  along with traditional preference for boys  may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth            According to the      census  the sex ratio at birth was        boys for every     girls       which is beyond the normal range of around     boys for every     girls       The      census found that males accounted for       percent of the total population       However  China s sex ratio is

and territorial waters   However  the CIA World Factbook includes the United States coastal and territorial waters  while Encyclop dia Britannica excludes the United States coastal and territorial waters   The Encyclop dia Britannica lists China as world s third largest country  after Russia and Canada  with a total area of           km       and the United States as fourth largest at           km      The CIA World Factbook lists China as fourth largest country  after Russia  Canada and the United States  with a total area of           km       and the United States as the third largest at           km       Notably  Encyclop dia Britannica specifies the United States  area  excluding coastal and territorial waters  as           km   which is less than either source s figure given for China s area      Therefore  while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters  it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters    United Nations Statistics Division s figure for the United States is           km             sq mi  and China is           km             sq mi   These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly include coastal and territorial waters for the United States  but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China    Further explanation of disputed ranking  The dispute for world s third largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States  This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations     against the information for United States in Encyclop dia Britannica  particularly its footnote section      In sum  according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook  from      to        the U S  was listed as the world s fourth largest country  after Russia  Canada  and China  with a total area of           km             sq mi   However  in the      edition  the U S  added coastal waters to its total area  increasing it to           square kilometres            sq mi    And then again in       U S  added territorial water to its total area  increasing it to           square kilometres            sq mi    During this time  China s total area remained unchanged  In other words  no coastal or territorial water area was added to China s total area figure  The United States has a coastal water area of         km          sq mi   and a territorial water area of         km          sq mi   for a total of         km           sq mi  of additional water space  This is larger than entire countries like Italy  New Zealand  and the United Kingdom  Adding this figure to the U S  will boost it over China in ranking since China s coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown  no official publication  and thus cannot be added into China s total area figure      The disputed   rd province of Taiwan is claimed by People s Republic of China but
