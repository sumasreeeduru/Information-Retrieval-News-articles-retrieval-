derived from the name of the Moskva River          There have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river  Finno Ugric Merya and Muroma people  who were among the several pre Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area  called the river supposedly Mustajoki  in English  Black river  It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term          The most linguistically well grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto Balto Slavic root  m zg  muzg  from the Proto Indo European  meu   wet               so the name Moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh      Its cognates include Russian         muzga  pool  puddle   Lithuanian  mazgoti and Latvian  mazg t  to wash   Sanskrit  m jjati  to drown   Latin  merg   to dip  immerse           In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname  most common in Bulgaria  Russia  Ukraine and North Macedonia      There exist as well similar place names in Poland like Mozgawa              The original Old Russian form of the name is reconstructed as          Mosky          hence it was one of a few Slavic   stem nouns  As with other nouns of that declension  it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language  as a result the first written mentions in the   th century were          Moskov   accusative case           Moskvi  locative case        e         Moskve Moskv   genitive case           From the latter forms came the modern Russian name         Moskva  which is a result of morphological generalisation with the numerous Slavic   stem nouns  However  the form Moskov  has left some traces in many other languages  such as English  Moscow  German  Moskau  French  Moscou  Georgian           Latvian  Maskava  Ottoman Turkish  Moskov  Tatar          M sk w  Kazakh          M skew  Chuvash          Muskav  etc  In a similar manner the Latin name Moscovia has been formed  later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the   th   th centuries  From it as well came English Muscovy and muscovite      Various other theories  of Celtic  Iranian  Caucasic origins   having little or no scientific ground  are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists           Other names edit  Moscow has acquired a number of epithets  most referring to its size and preeminent status within the

architecture is world renowned  Moscow is the site of Saint Basil s Cathedral  with its elegant onion domes  as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters  The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the   th century  Medieval Moscow s design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares  This layout  as well as Moscow s rivers  helped shape Moscow s design in subsequent centuries    The sculpture of Worker and Kolkhoz Woman  an example of Socialist realism in an Art Deco aesthetic The Kremlin was rebuilt in the   th century  Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects  lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance  From the end of the   th century  the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries  palaces  walls  towers  and churches  The city s appearance had not changed much by the   th century  Houses were made of pine and spruce logs  with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark  The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the   th century was necessitated not only by constant fires but also the needs of the nobility  Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style      For much of its architectural history  Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches  However  the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times  especially as a result of Joseph Stalin s large scale effort to  modernize  Moscow  Stalin s plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways  some of them over ten lanes wide  which  while greatly simplifying movement through the city  were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts  Among the many casualties of Stalin s demolitions was the Sukharev Tower  a longtime city landmark  as well as mansions and commercial buildings The city s newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation  made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition  Many of the city s churches  which in most cases were some of Moscow s oldest and most prominent buildings  were destroyed  some notable examples include the Kazan Cathedral and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior  During the     s  both were rebuilt  Many smaller churches  however  were lost        GUM department store  facing the Red Square  Ostankino Tower  the tallest freestanding structure in Europe  and the eighth tallest in the world While the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation  the earlier post revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city  Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with VKHUTEMAS  responsible for such landmarks as Lenin s Mausoleum  Another prominent architect was Vladimir Shukhov  famous for Shukhov Tower  just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov  It was built between      and      as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company      Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia  He designed spacious elongated shop galleries  most notably the GUM department store on Red Square      bridged with innovative metal and glass vaults    One of the Seven Sisters  Hotel Ukraina  is the tallest hotel in Europe  and one of the tallest hotels in the world  Zhivopisny Bridge  the highest cable stayed bridge in Europe Perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so called Seven Sisters  seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin  A defining feature of Moscow s skyline  their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York City  and their style with intricate exteriors and a large central spire has been described as Stalinist Gothic architecture  All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city  they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the Ostankino Tower  which  when it was completed in       was the highest free standing land structure in the world and today remains the world s seventy second tallest  ranking among buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai  Taipei     in Taiwan and the CN Tower in Toronto      The Soviet goal of providing housing for every family  and the rapid growth of Moscow s population  led to the construction of large  monotonous housing blocks  Most of these date from the post Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power  Brezhnev  Khrushchev  etc    They are usually badly maintained  Although the city still has some five story apartment buildings constructed before the mid     s  more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall  and have elevators  It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as Chicago  Moslift  one of the city s major elevator operating companies  has about      elevator mechanics on call  to release residents trapped in elevators      Stalinist era buildings  mostly found in the central part of the city  are massive and usually ornamented with Socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes  However  small churches almost always Eastern Orthodox  found across the city provide glimpses of its past  The Old Arbat Street  a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area  preserves most of its buildings from prior to the   th century  Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city  behind the Stalinist fa ades of Tverskaya Street  for example  are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of Tsarist times  Ostankino Palace  Kuskovo  Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era  and some convents  and monasteries  both inside and outside the city  are open to Muscovites and tourists    Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious MIBC  Attempts are being made to restore many of the city s best kept examples of pre Soviet architecture  These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless fa ades  There are a few examples of notable  early Soviet avant garde work too  such as the house of the architect Konstantin Melnikov in the Arbat area  Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of

century       Some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures  which include many works by architect

planning development began to show as early as the   th century when the city was founded  The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban
