Istanbul The first known name of the city is Byzantium  Greek             Byz ntion   the name given to it at its foundation by Megarean colonists around     BCE      The name is thought to be derived from a personal name  Byzas  Ancient Greek tradition refers to a legendary king of that name as the leader of the Greek colonists  Modern scholars have also hypothesized that the name of Byzas was of local Thracian or Illyrian origin and hence predated the Megarean settlement      After Constantine the Great made it the new eastern capital of the Roman Empire in     CE  the city became widely known as Constantinople  which  as the Latinized form of                      Konstantino polis   means the  City of Constantine       Constantinople remained the most common name for the city in the West until the establishment of the Turkish Republic  which urged other countries to use Istanbul          Kostantiniyye  Ottoman Turkish               Be Makam e Qonstantiniyyah al Mahmiyyah  meaning  the Protected Location of Constantinople   and  stanbul were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule      The name  stanbul  Turkish pronunciation   is tanbu    listen   colloquially   s tambu    is commonly held to derive from the Medieval Greek phrase                  pronounced  is tim  bolin    which means  to the city      and is how Constantinople was referred to by the local Greeks  This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity  The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world was also reflected by its Ottoman name  Der Saadet  meaning the  gate to Prosperity  in Ottoman  An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from the name Constantinople  with the first and third syllables dropped       Some Ottoman sources of the   th century  such as Evliya  elebi  describe it as the common Turkish name of the time  between the late   th and late   th centuries  it was also in official use  The first use of the word  Islambol  on coinage was in            AH  during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III      In modern Turkish  the name is written as  stanbul  with a dotted    as the Turkish alphabet distinguishes between a dotted and dotless I  In English the stress is on the first or last syllable  but in Turkish it is on the second syllable  tan       A person from the city is an  stanbullu  plural   stanbullular

beginning of the   st century  indicate that Istanbul s historic peninsula was settled as far back as the  th millennium BCE      That early settlement  important in the spread of the Neolithic Revolution from the Near East to Europe  lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by rising water levels                  The first human settlement on the Asian side  the Fikirtepe mound  is from the Copper Age period  with artifacts dating from      to      BCE      On the European side  near the point of the peninsula  Sarayburnu   there was a Thracian settlement during the early  st millennium BCE  Modern authors have linked it to the Thracian toponym Lygos      mentioned by Pliny the Elder as an earlier name for the site of Byzantium      The history of the city proper begins around     BCE      c  when Greek settlers from Megara established Byzantium on the European side of the Bosphorus  The settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the Golden Horn on the site of the early Thracian settlements  fueling the nascent city s economy      The city experienced a brief period of Persian rule at the turn of the  th century BCE  but the Greeks recaptured it during the Greco Persian Wars      Byzantium then continued as part of the Athenian League and its successor  the Second Athenian League  before gaining independence in     BCE      Long allied with the Romans  Byzantium officially became a part of the Roman Empire in    CE      Byzantium s decision to side with the Roman usurper Pescennius Niger against Emperor Septimius Severus cost it dearly  by the time it surrendered at the end of     CE  two years of siege had left the city devastated      Five years later  Severus began to rebuild Byzantium  and the city regained and  by some accounts  surpassed its previous prosperity       Rise and fall of Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire edit  Main article  Constantinople  Originally a church  later a mosque  the  th century Hagia Sophia           by Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great was the largest cathedral in the world for nearly a thousand years  until the completion of the Seville Cathedral        in Spain   Created in      by Cristoforo Buondelmonti  this is the oldest surviving map of Constantinople  Constantine the Great effectively became the emperor of the whole of the Roman Empire in September          Two months later  he laid out the plans for a new  Christian city to replace Byzantium  As the eastern capital of the empire  the city was named Nova Roma  most called it Constantinople  a name that persisted into the   th century      On    May      Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman Empire  which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on    January      when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman  Byzantine  Empire      The establishment of Constantinople was one of Constantine s most lasting accomplishments  shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a center of Greek culture and Christianity          Numerous churches were built across the city  including Hagia Sophia which was built during the reign of Justinian the Great and remained the world s largest cathedral for a thousand years      Constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the Hippodrome of Constantinople  accommodating tens of thousands of spectators  the hippodrome became central to civic life and  in the  th and  th centuries  the center of episodes of unrest  including the Nika riots          Constantinople s location also ensured its existence would stand the test of time  for many centuries  its walls and seafront protected Europe against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam      During most of the Middle Ages  the latter part of the Byzantine era  Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world          Constantinople began to decline continuously after the end of the reign of Basil II in       The Fourth Crusade was diverted from its purpose in       and the city was sacked and pillaged by the crusaders      They established the Latin Empire in place of the Orthodox Byzantine Empire      Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in       The Byzantine Empire was restored  albeit weakened  in           Constantinople s churches  defenses  and basic services were in disrepair      and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the  th century  d  After the reconquest of       however  some of the city s monuments were restored  and some  like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye  were created  citation needed  Various economic and military policies instituted by Andronikos II  such as the reduction of military forces  weakened the empire and left it vulnerable to attack      In the mid   th century  the Ottoman Turks began a strategy of gradually taking smaller towns and cities  cutting off Constantinople s supply routes and strangling it slowly      On    May       after an eight week siege  during which the last Roman emperor  Constantine XI  was killed   Sultan Mehmed II  the Conqueror  captured Constantinople and declared it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire  Hours later  the sultan rode to the Hagia Sophia and summoned an imam to proclaim the Islamic creed  converting the grand cathedral into an imperial mosque due to the city s refusal to surrender peacefully      Mehmed declared himself as the new  Kaysar

Constantinople e   Mehmed II immediately set out to revitalize the city  Cognizant that revitalization would fail without the repopulation of the city  Mehmed II welcomed everyone foreigners  criminals  and runaways  showing extraordinary openness and willingness to incorporate outsiders that came to define Ottoman political culture      He also invited people from all over Europe to his capital  creating a cosmopolitan society that persisted through much of the Ottoman period      Revitalizing Istanbul also required a massive program of restorations  of everything from roads to aqueducts      Like many monarchs before and since  Mehmed II transformed Istanbul s urban landscape with wholesale redevelopment of the city center      There was a huge new palace to rival  if not overshadow  the old one  a new covered market  still standing as the Grand Bazaar   porticoes  pavilions  walkways  as well as more than a dozen new mosques      Mehmed II turned the ramshackle old town into something that looked like an imperial capital      Social hierarchy was ignored by the rampant plague  which killed the rich and the poor alike in the sixteenth century      Money could not protect the rich from all the discomforts and harsher sides of Istanbul      Although the Sultan lived at a safe remove from the masses  and the wealthy and poor tended to live side by side  for the most part Istanbul was not zoned as modern cities are      Opulent houses shared the same streets and districts with tiny hovels      Those rich enough to have secluded country properties had a chance

is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture  and despite its development as a Turkish city since       contains both Christian and ancient monuments  There are three ancient monuments in the city       The most ancient is the Egyptian Obelisk       Built of red granite     m      ft  high  it came from the Temple of Karnak at Luxor  erected in      BC       It was brought to Istanbul in     CE by the order of Constantine II and put up in the Hippodrome       When re erected  the Egyptian Obelisk was mounted on a decorative base  with a statue that depicted Theodosius I and his courtiers       Next in age is the Serpentine Column  from     BCE       It was brought from Delphi in the time of Augustus and also erected in the Hippodrome       The slightly smaller Column of Constantine Porphyrogenitus  was another of Augustus s trophies  Built of porphyry     m      ft  high  it came from Heliopolis  erected in     CE to inaugurate the new Byzantine capital       Originally part of a sculpture of Emperor Constantine the Great dressed as Apollo  the column first stood at the entrance to the Forum of Constantine       There are traces of the Byzantine era throughout the city  from ancient churches that were built over early Christian meeting places like Chora Church  Hagia Irene to public places like the Hippodrome  the Augustaion  It is the Hagia Sophia  however  that fully conveys the period of Constantinople as a city without parallel in Christendom   Hagia Sophia  topped by a dome    meters      ft  in diameter over a square space defined by four arches  is the pinnacle of the Byzantine architecture       Hagia Sophia stood as the world s largest cathedral in the world until it was converted into a mosque in the   th century       The

series of additions enfolding four courtyards and blending neoclassical  rococo  and baroque architectural forms       In      Murat IV made some of the most lavish additions  including the Baghdad Kiosk  to commemorate his conquest of Baghdad the previous year       Government meetings took place here until       when the seat of government was moved to the Sublime Porte       After several

Ahmed Mosque  the Blue Mosque   and Yeni Mosque  all of which were built at the peak of the Ottoman Empire  in the   th and   th centuries  In the following centuries  and especially after the Tanzimat reforms  Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles       An example of which is the imperial Nuruosmaniye Mosque  Areas around  stiklal Avenue were filled with grand European

   the airport will be able to accommodate     million passengers a year         Istanbul Airport is the largest airport in the city  When all of its phases will be completed  it will be able to serve up to     million passengers per year  Istanbul Atat rk Airport  located    kilometers     mi  west of the city center  on the European side  near the Marmara Sea coast  was formerly the city s largest airport  After its closure to commercial flights in       it was briefly used by cargo aircraft and the official state aircraft owned by the Turkish government  until the demolition of its runway began in       It handled      million passengers in       which made it the third busiest airport in Europe and the eighteenth busiest in the world in that year       Sabiha G k en International     kilometers     mi  southeast of the city center  on the Asian side  was opened in      to relieve Atat rk  Dominated by low cost carriers  Istanbul s second airport has rapidly become popular  especially since the opening of a new international terminal in            the airport handled      million passengers in       a year after Airports Council International named it the world s fastest growing airport            Atat rk had also experienced rapid growth  as its      percent rise in passenger traffic between      and      was the highest among the world s top    airports        Air pollution from traffic edit  Air pollution in Turkey is acute in  stanbul with cars  buses and taxis causing frequent urban smog       as it is one of the few European cities without a low emission zone  As of      update  the city s mean air quality remains of a level so as to affect the heart and lungs of healthy street bystanders during peak traffic hours       and

Asia  with its commercial and historical centre and two thirds of the population in Europe  the rest in Asia  Since Istanbul is a transcontinental city  Moscow is the largest city entirely within Europe     The foundation of Byzantion  Byzantium  is sometimes  especially in encyclopedic or other tertiary sources  placed firmly in     BCE  Historians have disputed the precise year the city was founded  Commonly cited is the work of  th century BCE historian Herodotus  which says the city was founded seventeen years after Chalcedon      which came into existence around     BCE  Eusebius concurs with     BCE as the year Chalcedon was founded  but places Byzantion s establishment in     BCE      Among more modern historians  Carl Roebuck proposed the    s BCE     and others have suggested even later  The foundation date of Chalcedon is itself subject to some debate  while many sources place it in     BC      others put it in     BCE     or even     BCE  with Byzantion s establishment placed in     BCE       Some sources refer to Byzantium s foundation as the  th century BCE     a b Historians disagree sometimes substantially on population figures of Istanbul  Constantinople   and other world cities  prior to the   th century  A follow up to Chandler   Fox      Chandler       pp              examines different sources  estimates and chooses the most likely based on historical conditions  it is the source of most population figures between     and       The ranges of values between     and      are due to Morris       which also does a comprehensive analysis of sources  including Chandler         Morris notes that many of Chandler s estimates during that time seem too large for the city s size  and presents smaller estimates  Chandler disagrees with Turan      on the population of the city in the mid     s  with the former suggesting         in        but Turan  p       is used as the source of population figures between      and       Turan s figures  as well as the      figure       come from the Turkish Statistical Institute  The drastic increase in population between      and      is largely due to an enlargement of the city s limits  see the Administration section   Explanations for population changes in pre Republic times can be inferred from the History section     In the Ottoman period the inner core of the city  inside the city walls  came to be known as   stanbul  in Turkish and  Stamboul  in the West  The whole city was generally known as Constantinople or under other names  See Names of Istanbul for further
