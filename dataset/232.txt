the people of the Council of Three Fires  Ojibwe  Potawatomi and Odawa   The French established trading posts in the area by      to take advantage of the lucrative fur trade  The Odawa moved from Manitoulin Island and the Bruce Peninsula at the invitation of the French  who established a trading post at Fort Detroit  about    miles to the north  They settled an area extending into northwest Ohio  By the early   th century  the Odawa occupied areas along most of the Maumee River to its mouth  They served as middlemen between the French and tribes further to the west and north  The Wyandot occupied central Ohio  and the Shawnee and Lenape occupied the southern areas          When the city of Toledo was preparing to pave its streets  it surveyed  two prehistoric semicircular earthworks  presumably for stockades   One was at the intersection of Clayton and Oliver streets on the south bank of Swan Creek  the other was at the intersection of Fassett and Fort streets on the right bank of the Maumee River      Such earthworks were typical of mound building peoples     th century edit  According to Charles E  Slocum  the American military built Fort Industry at the mouth of Swan Creek about       as a temporary stockade  No official reports support the   th century tradition of its earlier history there      The United States continued to work to extinguish land claims of Native Americans  In the Treaty of Detroit         the above four tribes ceded a large land area to the United States of what became southeastern Michigan and northwestern Ohio  to the mouth of the Maumee River  where Toledo later developed   Reserves for the Odawa were set aside in northwestern Ohio for a limited period of time  The Native Americans signed the treaty at Detroit  Michigan  on November           with William Hull  governor of the Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs  as the sole representative of the U S        Peter Navarre  frontiersman  hero of the Battle of Lake Erie More European American settlers entered the area over the next few years  but many fled during the War of       when British forces raided the area with their Indian allies  Resettlement began around      after a Cincinnati syndicate purchased a     acre      km   tract at the mouth of Swan Creek and named it Port Lawrence  developing it as the modern downtown area of Toledo  Immediately to the north of that  another syndicate founded the town of Vistula  the historic north end      These two towns bordered each other across Cherry Street  This is why present day streets on the street s northeast side run at a slightly different angle from those southwest of it  In       the Ohio state legislature authorized the construction of the Miami and Erie Canal and in       its Wabash and Erie Canal extension  The canal s purpose was to connect the city of Cincinnati to Lake Erie for water transportation to eastern markets  including to New York City via the Erie Canal and Hudson River  At that time no highways had been built in the state  and it was very difficult for goods produced locally to reach the larger markets east of the Appalachian Mountains  During the canal s planning phase  many small towns along the northern shores of Maumee River heavily competed to be the ending terminus of the canal  knowing it would give them a profitable status      The towns of Port Lawrence and Vistula merged in      to better compete against the upriver towns of Waterville and Maumee  The inhabitants of this joined settlement chose the name Toledo     but the reason for this choice is buried in a welter of legends  One recounts that Washington Irving  who was traveling in Spain at the time  suggested the name to his brother  a local resident  this explanation ignores the fact that Irving returned to the United States in       Others award the honor to Two Stickney  son of the major who quaintly numbered his sons and named his daughters after States  The most popular version attributes the naming to Willard J  Daniels  a merchant  who reportedly suggested Toledo because it  is easy to pronounce  is pleasant in sound  and there is no other city of that name on the American continent       Despite Toledo s efforts  the canal built the final terminus in Manhattan  one half mile      m  to the north of Toledo  because it was closer to Lake Erie  As a compromise  the state placed two sidecuts before the terminus  one in Toledo at Swan Creek and another in Maumee  about    miles to the southwest  Among the numerous treaties made between the Ottawa and the United States were two signed in this area  at Miami  Maumee  Bay in      and Maumee  Ohio  upriver of Toledo  in           These actions were among US purchases or exchanges of land in order to accomplish Indian Removal of the Ottawa from areas wanted for European American settlement  The last of the Odawa did not leave this area until       when Ottokee  grandson of Pontiac  led his band from their village at the mouth of the Maumee River to Indian Territory in Kansas            Bird s eye view of Toledo drawn in      An almost bloodless conflict between Ohio and the Michigan Territory  called the Toledo War              was  fought  over a narrow strip of land from the Indiana border to Lake Erie  now containing the city and the suburbs of Sylvania and Oregon  Ohio  The strip which varied between five and eight miles     km  in width was claimed by both the state of Ohio and the Michigan Territory due to conflicting legislation concerning the location of the Ohio Michigan state line  Militias from both states were sent to the border but never engaged  The only casualty of the conflict was a Michigan deputy sheriff stabbed in the leg with a pen knife by Two Stickney during the arrest of his elder brother  One Stickney and the loss of two horses  two pigs and a few chickens stolen from an Ohio farm by lost members of the Michigan militia  Major Benjamin Franklin Stickney  father of One and Two Stickney  had been instrumental in pushing Congress to rule in favor of Ohio gaining Toledo      In the end  the state of Ohio was awarded the land after the state of Michigan was given a larger portion of the Upper Peninsula in exchange      Stickney Avenue in Toledo is named for Major Stickney    A postcard of Toledo in      Toledo was very slow to expand during its first two decades of settlement  The first lot was sold in the Port Lawrence section of the city in       It held       persons in       and five years later it had gained just seven more persons  Settlers came and went quickly through Toledo and between      and       ownership of land had changed so many times that none of the original parties remained in the town  The canal and its Toledo sidecut entrance were completed in       Soon after the canal was functional  the new canal boats had become  too large to use the shallow waters at the terminus in Manhattan  More boats began using the Swan Creek sidecut than its official terminus  quickly putting the Manhattan warehouses out of business and triggering a rush to move business to Toledo  Most of Manhattan s residents moved out by         A      Interstate planning map of Toledo The      census recorded Toledo as having       residents and Manhattan      The      census shows Toledo with a population of        and Manhattan with      While the towns were only a mile apart  Toledo grew by      in ten years  Manhattan s growth was on a small base and never competed  given the drawbacks of its lesser canal outlet  By the     s  Toledo expanded over the vacant streets of Manhattan and Tremainsville  a small town to the west          In the last half of the   th century  railroads slowly began to replace canals as the major form of transportation  They were faster and had greater capacity  Toledo soon became a hub for several railroad companies and a hotspot for industries such as furniture producers  carriage makers  breweries  glass manufacturers  and others  Large immigrant populations came to the area    Toledo c         th century edit  In the     s  Toledo had one of the highest rates of industrial growth in the United States      Toledo continued to expand in population and industry  but because of its dependence on manufacturing  the city was hit hard by the Great Depression  Many large scale WPA projects were constructed to reemploy citizens in the     s  Some of these include the amphitheater and aquarium at the Toledo Zoo and a major expansion to the Toledo Museum of Art    A postcard of Toledo in the Depression era The post war job boom and Great Migration brought thousands of African Americans to Toledo to work in industrial jobs  where they had previously been denied  Due to redlining  many of them settled along Dorr Street  which  during the     s and   s was lined with flourishing black owned businesses and homes  Desegregation  a failed urban renewal project  and the construction of I    displaced those residents and left behind a struggling community with minimal resources  even as it also drew more established  middle class people  white and black  out of center cities for newer housing      The city rebounded  but the slump of American manufacturing in the second half of the   th century during industrial restructuring cost many jobs  By the     s  Toledo had a depressed economy      The destruction of many buildings downtown  along with several failed business ventures in housing in the core  led to a reverse city suburb wealth problem common in small cities with land to spare     st century edit  In       Cleveland Cliffs  Inc  invested      million into an East Toledo location as the site of a new hot briquetted iron plant  designed to modernize the steel industry  The plant is slated to create over      jobs and be completed in           Several initiatives have been taken by Toledo s citizens to improve the cityscape by urban gardening and revitalizing their communities      Local artists  supported by organizations like the Arts Commission of Greater Toledo and the Ohio Arts Council  have contributed an array of murals and beautification works to replace long standing blight      Many downtown historical buildings such as the Oliver House and Standart Lofts have been renovated into restaurants  condominiums  offices and art galleries       Geography edit  Toledo is located at          N          W              N          W                                                     The city has a total area of       square miles         km    of which       square miles         km   is land and      square miles       km   is water      The city straddles the Maumee River at its mouth at the southern end of Maumee Bay  the westernmost inlet of Lake Erie  The city is located north of what had been the Great Black Swamp  giving rise to another nickname  Frog Town  Toledo sits within the borders of a sandy oak savanna called the Oak Openings Region  an important ecological site that once comprised more than     square miles      km        Toledo is within     miles      km  by road from seven metro areas that have a population of more than two million people  they are Detroit  Cleveland  Columbus  Cincinnati  Pittsburgh  Indianapolis  and Chicago   Climate edit  Toledo  as with much of the Great Lakes region  has a humid continental climate  K ppen Dfa   characterized by four distinct seasons  Lake Erie moderates the climate somewhat  especially in late spring and fall  when air and water temperature differences are maximal  However  this effect is lessened in the winter because Lake Erie  unlike the other Great Lakes  usually freezes over  coupled with prevailing winds that are often westerly  And in the summer  prevailing winds south and west over the lake bring heat and moisture to the city  Summers are very warm and humid  with July averaging       F        C  and temperatures of     F      C  or more seen on      days      Winters are cold and somewhat snowy  with a January mean temperature of       F        C   and lows at or below    F       C  on     nights      The spring months tend to be the wettest time of year  although precipitation is common year round   November and December can get very cloudy  but January and February usually clear up after the lake freezes  July is the sunniest month overall      About    inches     cm  of snow falls per year  much less than the Snow Belt cities  because of the prevailing wind direction  Temperature extremes have ranged from      F       C  on January           to      F      C  on July               Climate data for Toledo  Ohio  Toledo Express Airport             normals  a
