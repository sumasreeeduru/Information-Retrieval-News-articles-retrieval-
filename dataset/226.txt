historic territory includes parts of Wisconsin  Minnesota  Iowa  and Illinois  Today  Ho Chunk people are enrolled in two federally recognized tribes  the Ho Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska  The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska have an Indian reservation in Nebraska  While related  the two tribes are distinct federally recognized sovereign nations and peoples  each having its own constitutionally formed government  and completely separate governing and business interests  Since the late   th century  both tribal councils have authorized the development of casinos to generate revenue to support economic development  infrastructure  health care and education  The Ho Chunk Nation is working on language restoration and has developed a Hooc k language iOS app  Since       it has pursued a claim to the Badger Army Ammunition Plant as traditional territory  the area has since been declared surplus  but the Ho Chunk have struggled with changes in policy at the Department of the Interior  The department supported the Ho Chunk claim in       but in      refused to accept the property on their behalf  citation needed  In       to build on its revenues from casinos  the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska created an economic development corporation  this has since grown and has received awards as a model of entrepreneurial small business  With a number of subsidiaries  it employs more than      people  It has also contributed to housing construction on the reservation  Like more than     of federally recognized tribes  the Winnebago Tribe has legalized alcohol sales on the reservation to secure revenues that previously went to the state in retail taxes  The Ho Chunk was the dominant tribe in its territory in the   th century  with a population estimated at several thousand  Ethnologists have speculated that  like some other Siouan peoples  the Ho Chunk may have originated along the East Coast and migrated west in pre colonial times  Nicolas Perrot wrote that the names given to them by neighboring Algonquian peoples may have referred to their origin near a salt water sea  The Ho Chunk suffered severe population losses in the   th century  to a low of perhaps as few as     individuals  This has been attributed to the loss of hundreds of warriors in a lake storm  epidemics of infectious disease  and competition for resources from migrating Algonquian tribes  By the early     s  their population had increased to        but they suffered further losses in the smallpox epidemic of       In      they numbered        current

which they believe to be given to them by their Creator  M   na  Earthmaker   citation needed   Their native name is Ho Chunk  or Hooc k   which has been variously translated as  sacred voice  or  People of the Big Voice   meaning mother tongue  as in they originated the Siouan language family  They usually refer to themselves as Hooc k waaziija ha i meaning  sacred voice people of the Pines   The term  Winnebago  is a term used by the Potawatomi  pronounced as  Winnipego   The Jesuit Relations of           said   He started  in the month of June of the year one thousand six hundred and fifty eight  from the lake of the Ouinipegouek  which is strictly only a large bay in lake Huron  It is called by others  the lake of the stinkards  not because it is salt like the water of the Sea   which the Savages call Ouinipeg  or stinking water   but because it is surrounded by sulphurous soil  whence issue several springs which convey into this lake the impurities absorbed by their waters in the places of their origin     Nicolas Perrot was a   th century French trader who believed that the Algonquian terms referred to salt water seas  as these have a distinctive aroma compared with fresh water lakes     An early Jesuit record says that the name refers to the origin of Le Puans near the salt water seas to the north     Algonquins also called the Winnebago   the people of the sea    A Native people who lived on the shores of Hudson Bay were called by the same name   When the explorers Jean Nicolet and Samuel de Champlain learned of the  sea  connection to the tribe s name  they were optimistic that it meant Les Puans were from or had lived near the Pacific Ocean  They hoped it indicated a passage to China via the great rivers of the Midwest  In recent studies  ethnologists have speculated that the Hooc gra  like the other Siouan speaking peoples  originated on the east coast of North America and gradually migrated west  Recently  several Hooc k elders have claimed that they originated in the Midwest and that they predated the last ice age  The early   th century researcher H R  Holand claimed they originated in Mexico  where they had contact with the Spanish and gained a knowledge of horses  David Lee contends the Hooc k were once akin to the Olmec there  His evidence derived from a culture based on corn growing  civilization type  and mound building  This followed the receding ice shield  However  Holand cites the records of Jonathan Carver  who lived with the Hooc gra in               But  contact with the Spanish could have occurred along the Gulf of Mexico or the south Atlantic coast  where other Hooc k type tribes originated and lived for centuries  Others suggested that the Hooc gra originated near saltwater  to explain how mid western tribes had a knowledge of the Pacific Ocean  which they described as being located where the earth ends and the sun sets into the sea  Oral histories from a past Hooc k orator  Wak haga  or Snake Skin  say that they migrated to Wisconsin from the Pacific southwest  where their endonym originally meant  People of the Big Fish   or more accurately  People of the Whale   Generally  however  the Hooc gra today claim that their people have always lived in what is now the north central United States     Linguistic and ethnographic studies have generated other deep histories of the various American Indian peoples   History edit   Winnebago family in      Ho Chunk oral history states that   We have always been here  in their current homelands of Wisconsin  but also in surrounding parts of Minnesota  Iowa  Missouri  and Illinois     Their Siouan language indicates common origin with the other peoples of this language group  They state their ancestors built the thousands of effigy mounds through Wisconsin and surrounding states    during the Late Woodland period  The tribe historically adopted corn agriculture at the end of the Late Woodland period as well as hunting  fishing  and gathering wild plants  They cultivated wild rice  Zizania spp    gathered sugar from sugar maple trees  European contact came in      with the arrival of French explorer Jean Nicolet  He wrote that the Winnebago Ho Chunk occupied the area around Green Bay of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin  reaching beyond Lake Winnebago to the Wisconsin River and to the Rock River in Illinois  The oral history also indicates that in the mid   th century  the influx of Ojibwe peoples in the northern portion of their lands caused the Ho Chunk to move to the south of their territory  They had some friction with the tribes of the Illinois Confederacy  as well as fellow Chiwere speaking peoples splitting from the Ho Chunk  These groups  who became the Iowa  Missouria  and Otoe tribes  moved south and west because the reduced range made it difficult for such a large population to be sustained     Nicolet reported a gathering of approximately       warriors as the Ho Chunk entertained him  Historians estimate that the population in      may have ranged from       to more than         Between that time and the first return of French trappers and traders in the late     s  the population was reduced drastically  Later reports were that the Ho Chunk numbered only about     people  They lost their dominance in the region  When numerous Algonquian tribes migrated west to escape the problems caused by the powerful Iroquois tribes  aggressiveness in the Beaver Wars  they competed with the Ho Chunk for game and resources  who had to yield to their greater numbers  The reasons given by historians for the reduction in population vary  but they agree on three major causes  the loss of several hundred warriors in a storm on a lake  infectious disease epidemics after contact with Europeans  and attacks by the Illinois Confederacy  The warriors were said to be lost on Lake Michigan after they had repulsed the first attack by invading the Potawatomi from what is now Door County  Wisconsin      Another says the number was          Another claim is that the     were lost in a storm on Lake Winnebago during a failed campaign against the Meskwaki      while yet another says it was in a battle against the Sauk      Even with such a serious loss of warriors  the historian R  David Edmunds notes that it was not enough to cause the near elimination of an entire people  He suggests two additional causes      The Winnebago apparently suffered from a widespread disease  perhaps an epidemic of one of the European infectious diseases  They had no immunity to the new diseases and suffered high rates of fatalities  Ho Chunk accounts said the victims turned yellow  which is not a trait of smallpox  however     Historians have rated disease as the major reason for the losses in all American Indian populations  Edmunds notes as a third cause of losses the following historic account  that many of the Ho Chunk s enemies  the Illinois Confederacy  came to help the tribe at their time of suffering and famine  aggravated by the loss of their hunters  The Winnebago then attacked the Illinois Confederacy  Enraged  additional Illinois warriors retaliated and killed nearly all the Ho Chunk      After peace was established between the French and Iroquois in       many of the Algonquian peoples returned to their homelands to the east  The Ho Chunk were relieved of the pressure on their territory  After       while some remained in the Green Bay area  most returned inland     From a low of perhaps less than      the population of the people gradually recovered  aided by intermarriage with neighboring tribes  and with some of the French traders and trappers  A count from      gives a population of      In       they numbered       or more  A census in      reported        but in      the number given is only        Like other American Indian tribes  the Ho Chunk suffered great losses during the smallpox epidemics of         and       In the   th century epidemic  they lost nearly one quarter of their population     Today the total population of the Ho Chunk people is about         Through a series of forced moves imposed by the U S  government in the   th century  the tribe was relocated to reservations increasingly further west  in Wisconsin  Minnesota  South Dakota  and finally Nebraska  There are    recorded removals of the Hooc gra on file in Washington  D C  citation needed  clarification needed  Following the forced relocations  many tribe members returned to previous homes  especially in Wisconsin  despite the U S  Army s repeated roundups and removals  The U S  government finally allowed the Wisconsin Winnebago to settle land in the state  where they have achieved federal recognition as a tribe  The Ho Chunk in Nebraska have gained independent federal recognition as a tribe and have a reservation in Thurston County  The Ho Chunk Nation now has a constitution that reinforces its sovereign abilities to negotiate with the U S  government  Waukon and Decorah  county seats of Allamakee and Winneshiek County  Iowa  respectively  were named after the   th century Ho Chunk chief Waukon Decorah   Culture edit   A Ho Chunk woman scraping meat from a deer hide in order to tan it       Before Europeans ventured into Ho Chunk territory  the Ho Chunk were known to hunt  farm and gather food from local sources  including nuts  berries  roots and edible leaves  They knew what the forest and river s edge had to give  and both genders had a role in making best use of resources  With the changing seasons  Ho Chunk families would move from area to area to find food  For example  many families would return to Black River Falls  Wisconsin to pick berries in the summer  Women of Ho Chunk society were responsible for growing  gathering and processing food for their families  including the cultivation of varieties of corn and squash  in order to have different types through the growing season  and gathering a wide variety of roots  nuts and berries  as well as sap from maple trees  In addition  women learned to recognize and use a wide range of roots and leaves for medicinal and herbal purposes      The maple sap was used to make syrup and candy  Women also processed and cooked game  making dried meats combined with berries  which could sustain the people and hunters when traveling  They tanned the hides to make clothing and storage bags  They used most parts of the game for tools  binding  clothing  and coverings for dwellings  They were responsible for the survival of the families  caring for the children as well as elders      The main role of the Ho Chunk man was as a hunter  in addition to a warrior when needed  Leaders among the men acted in political relations with other tribes or peoples  As hunters  they would catch fish by spearing them and clubbing the fish to death  The men would also hunt game such as muskrat  mink  otter  beaver  and deer      Some men learned to create jewelry and other body decorations out of silver and copper  for both men and women      To become men  boys would go through a rite of passage at puberty  they fasted for a period  during which they were expected to acquire a guardian spirit for  without it  their lives would be miserable  Besides having a guardian spirit  men would also try to acquire protection and powers from specific spirits  which was done by making offerings along with tobacco      For example  a man could not go on the warpath without first performing the  war bundle feast   which contained two parts  The first part honored the night spirits and the second part honored the Thunderbird spirit  The blessings that these spirits gave the men were embodied in objects that together made the war bundle  These objects could include feathers  bones  skins  flutes  and paints        Winnebago courting flute Ho Chunk clans edit  Before the United States government removed the Ho Chunk from their native land of Wisconsin  the tribe made up of    different clans  These clans are listed below    Hokiikarac   Ho Chunk Clans   Name  Translation   Wak ja Thunderbird   Won  ire W  k ik People of War   Cax ep Eagle

traditional responsibilities within the nation  each clan had a role in the survival of the people  Like other Native Americans  the Ho Chunk had rules generally requiring people to marry outside their clans  The kinship system was based in the family  and gave structure to descent and inheritance rules  Although the tribe is patrilineal today  anthropologists believe they may have had a matrilineal kinship system in the   th century  before their major losses  At that time  the matriarchs of a clan would name its chief  and they could reclaim the position if they disapproved of his actions  The Ho Chunk may have shifted to the patrilineal system due to marriage into other tribes  or under the influence of the male oriented fur trade      Today there are two federally recognized tribes of Ho Chunk people  the Ho Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska   Ho Chunk Nation edit  Main article  Ho Chunk Nation of Wisconsin This tribe is headquartered in Black River Falls  Wisconsin      Formerly known as the Wisconsin Winnebago Tribe  they changed their name to  Ho Chunk Nation  to take back their traditional Siouan name for themselves  They are the larger of the two tribes  They also call themselves Wonkshieks    First People of the Old Island   The Ho Chunk have established the Hooc k Waaziija Haci Language and Culture Division  which has developed materials to teach and restore use of the Hoc k language  as well as other elements of the traditional culture  Among its recent innovations are developing a Hoc k language app for the iPhone      The Ho Chunk have about     native speakers among its elders and are working to develop more      Of the       tribe members as of    May             lived in Wisconsin  and       lived elsewhere  They include       males and       females        are minors        are adults  and     are elders  citation needed  The tribe owns       acres         km   scattered across parts of    counties in Wisconsin and one county in Minnesota  The largest concentrations are in Jackson  Clark  and Monroe counties in Wisconsin  Smaller areas lie in Adams  Crawford  Dane  Juneau  La Crosse  Marathon  Rock  Sauk  Shawano  and Wood counties in Wisconsin  The Ho Chunk Nation also owns land in Lynwood  Illinois       Government edit  The Ho Chunk Nation established a written constitution  It is governed by an elected council  As of      update   the current president is Marlon WhiteEagle  Since the late   th century  the tribe has developed and operates six casinos in Wisconsin to generate revenues for its people and provide employment   Ho Chunk Gaming Wisconsin Dells in Baraboo  Ho Chunk Gaming Black River Falls in Black River Falls      Ho Chunk Gaming Nekoosa in Nekoosa      Ho Chunk Gaming

Nation in Beloit  Wisconsin to the Ho Chunk Nation for a proposed casino      The council has used revenues to develop infrastructure  healthcare and educational support for its people  In       the Ho Chunk Nation filed a timely claim for transfer of the Badger Army Ammunition Plant  BAAP   which was to be declared surplus under federal regulations  As part of their former traditional territory  the property holds historical  archeological  sacred and cultural resources important to their people  It is a      acre parcel in Sauk County  Wisconsin  In      the Secretary of the Interior had issued a letter to claim the land on behalf of the Ho Chunk but  in       the Bureau of Indian Affairs  BIA  refused to accept the property  It said it was unwilling to spend monies to conduct the environmental assessment      The Ho Chunk are continuing to pursue the case  as they note that  between      and       the Army spent millions of dollars in environmental assessment and cleanup to prepare the property for transfer  In      the National Congress of American Indians  NCAI  passed a resolution in support of the Ho Chunk and encouraging the BIA as a policy matter to accept surplus lands as trust lands on behalf of tribes       Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska edit  Main article  Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska  Martha Gradolf  a contemporary weaver  is enrolled in the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska      The tribe has a reservation in northeastern Nebraska     and western Iowa  The Winnebago Indian Reservation lies primarily in the northern part of Thurston and a small part of Dixon counties in Nebraska  with an additional portion in Woodbury County  Iowa  A small plot of off reservation land of        acres         km   is in southern Craig Township in Burt County  Nebraska  The total land area is         km          sq mi   They also call themselves Hochungra    People of the Parent Speech   which resembles the Ho Chunk of the Nebraska branch of the Winnebago  The Iowa portion was originally west of the Missouri River and within Nebraska boundaries  But  after the United States Army Corps of Engineers changed the course of the river  some of the reservation land was redefined as falling within the boundaries of Iowa  The tribe successfully argued that the land belonged to them under the terms of the deed prior to diversion of the river  This land has a postal address of Sloan  Iowa  as rural addresses are normally covered by the nearest post office  The      census reported a population of       persons living on these lands  The largest community is the village of Winnebago  with other communities in Emerson and Thurston  Nebraska  In      their enrolled population was estimated at            The federally recognized Omaha also have a reservation in Thurston County  Together  the Native American tribes occupy the entire land area of Thurston County   Government edit  The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska established a written constitution  It is governed by an elected nine person council  Since      the Winnebago tribe has owned and operated the WinnaVegas Casino in the Iowa portion of its reservation  The tribe has legalized alcohol sales on the reservation in order to retain revenues that formerly went to the state through liquor taxes paid to retailers off the reservation  The tribe now has the authority to directly regulate alcohol sales  It is earning revenues to provide medical and other treatment for individuals and families affected by alcoholism  More than     of federally recognized tribes in the lower    states have legalized alcohol sales for the same reason   to derive the economic benefit and better regulate this issue      In      the tribe established Ho Chunk  Inc   an economic development corporation that now employs      people and has provided revenues to the tribe for improvements to the quality of life of its members  Its success has gained awards for small business  and it has a number of subsidiaries  It has initiated a strong housing construction program in collaboration with federal programs  Its leaders were featured on Native American Entrepreneurs  airing in      on PBS       Land claims edit  According to Gordon Thunder  Wak ja  who    the Ho Chunk have been systematically removed from their homelands  with other tribes now occupying many of those places  The Ho Chunk Nation of Wisconsin  which at one time consisted primarily of tribal members spread over    counties of Wisconsin  have a historical territorial claim in an area encompassed by a line from Green Bay to Long Prairie to St  Louis to Chicago  Some in the federal and state governments have undermined the Ho Chunk land claims  however  repatriation activities document where many villages once stood
