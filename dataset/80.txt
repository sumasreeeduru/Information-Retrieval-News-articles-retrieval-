and media studies that compels policymakers to intervene in humanitarian situations by using the mainstream media  Despite these origins  the term as used generally refers to a broad range of real time modern media and is not exclusive to CNN  the United States  or    hour news stations   Contents    History   Research   In natural disasters   See also   Notes   External links   History edit  The    hour international television news channel Cable News Network  CNN  had a major impact on the conduct of United States  foreign policy in the late Cold War period  CNN and its subsequent industry competitors have had a similar impact in the post Cold War era  clarification needed  While the free press has  in its role as the  Fourth Estate   always had an influence on policy making in representative democracies  proponents of the CNN effect argue that the extent  depth  and speed of the new global media have created a new species of effects qualitatively different from those that preceded them        The term s coinage reflects the role played by the CNN whose coverage of many events outside the U S    like the Tiananmen Square protests of       the fall of Communism in eastern Europe  the first Gulf War  and the Battle of Mogadishu   was viewed as being strongly influential in bringing images and issues to the immediate forefront of the American political consciousness  Additionally  the CNN effect was the driving force behind the U S  intervention in the Kurdish crisis and the use of force by the U S  army during the Bosnia war of                Research edit  In his research paper Clarifying the CNN Effect  An examination of Media Effects According to Type of Military Intervention  George Washington University professor Steven Livingston identifies three distinct aspects that fall under the broad term of the CNN effect  The media may function alternately or simultaneously as      a policy agenda setting agent      an impediment to the achievement of desired policy goals      an accelerant to policy decision making   Italics in original      and     one of the common grounds of CNN effect is policy uncertainty  as policy certainty reduces  media influence increases and vice versa     By focusing instantaneous and ongoing media coverage on a particular conflict  international incident  or diplomatic initiative  the news cycle effectively demands political attention  as governing politicians attempt to demonstrate that they are  on top of  current issues  The effect has been  according to Margaret Belknap  that   t he advent of real time news coverage has led to immediate public awareness and scrutiny of strategic decisions and military operations as they unfold      Deeper penetration and wider broadcast of statements and actions by public figures may increase transparency  but it can also complicate sensitive diplomatic relationships between states or force an official reaction from governments that would otherwise prefer to minimize political risk by remaining noncommittal  The information revolution and spread of global mass media through the Internet and international    hour news thus accelerates the policy making process  requiring a faster tempo of decision and action to forestall the appearance of a leadership vacuum  Former Secretary of State James Baker said of the CNN effect   The one thing it does  is to drive policymakers to have a policy position  I would have to articulate it very quickly  You are in real time mode  You don t have time to reflect   His former press secretary Margaret Tutwiler mirrors his sentiment   Time for reaction is compressed  Analysis and intelligence gathering is out       In natural disasters edit  While the CNN effect most commonly refers to the effect that news media have on politics and government during political conflict  its effect on decisions made during natural disasters is also noteworthy  As videos and images are broadcast worldwide immediately after or even during natural disasters  these images may convince the public to donate money or pressure governments for immediate action  The CNN effect may have played a role in increasing aid following the Asian tsunami         the Kashmir earthquake         Hurricane Katrina         and the Sichuan earthquake in China         Following the Asian tsunami  for instance  the media  blitz  that followed this natural disaster may have helped prompt an unprecedented outpouring of donations   By February       the international community had donated      per person affected by the tsunami  compared to just    cents for each person affected by Uganda s    year war       See also edit  Al Jazeera effect Broadcast journalism News broadcasting Media circus
