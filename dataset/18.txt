Netflix s founder Reed Hastings decided it would hamper license arrangements with third parties  potentially keeping Netflix off other similar platforms  and killed the project     Fast Company

early      and it was released in late       These TVs are manufactured by companies like TCL  Westinghouse and Hisense  and use the Roku user interface as the  brain  of the TV  Roku TVs are updated just like the streaming devices      More recent vague  models also integrate a set of features for use with over the air TV signals  including a program guide that provides information for shows and movies available on local antenna broadcast TV  as well as where that content is available to stream  and the ability to pause live TV  although the feature requires a USB hard drive with at least   GB storage   In January        Roku created a badge to certify devices as working with a Roku TV model      The first certified brands were TCL North America  Sound United  Polk Audio  Marantz  Definitive Technology  and Class    Software edit  The Roku box runs a custom Linux distribution called Roku OS  Updates to the software include bug fixes  security updates  feature additions  and many new interface revisions  Roku pushes OS updates to supported devices in a staggered release  OS updates are rolled out to a percentage group of candidate devices to ensure the build is stable before being made available en masse   Content and programming edit  Roku provides video services from a number of Internet based video on demand providers   Roku channels edit  Content on Roku devices are provided by Roku partners and are identified using the term channel  Users can add or remove different channels using the Roku Channel Store   Service creation for Roku Player edit  The Roku is an open platform device with a freely available software development kit that enables anyone to create new channels      The channels are written in a Roku specific language called BrightScript  a scripting language the company describes as  unique   but  similar to Visual Basic  and  similar to JavaScript       Developers who wish to test their channels before a general release  or who wish to limit viewership  can create  private  channels that require a code be entered by the user in the account page of the Roku website  These private channels  which are not part of the official Roku Channel Store  are neither reviewed or certified by Roku          There is an NDK  Native Developer Kit  available  though it has added restrictions       The Roku Channel edit  Roku launched its own streaming channel on its devices in October       It is ad supported  but free  Its licensed content includes movies and TV shows from studios such as Lionsgate  MGM  Paramount  Sony Pictures Entertainment  Warner Bros   and Disney as well as Roku channel content publishers American Classics  FilmRise  Nosey  OVGuide  Popcornflix  Vidmark  and YuYu  It is implementing an ad revenue sharing model with content providers  On August          The Roku Channel became available on the web as well      Roku also added the  Featured Free  section as the top section of its main menu from which users can get access to direct streaming of shows and movies from its partners      In January       premium subscription options from select content providers were added to The Roku Channel      The Roku Channel used to only be available in the US       but on April         it launched in the UK  with a different selection of movies and TV shows  and without premium subscription add ons       Controversies edit  Non certified channels edit  The Daily Beast observed that non certified channels on Roku eased access to materials promoting conspiracy theories and terrorism content      In June       a Mexico City court banned the sale of Roku products in Mexico  following claims by Televisa  via its Izzi cable subsidiary   that the devices were being used for subscription based streaming services that illegally stream television content without permission from copyright holders  The devices used Roku s private channels feature to install the services  which were all against the terms of service Roku applies for official channels available in its store  Roku defended itself against the allegations as such  stating that these channels were not officially certified and that the company takes active measures to stop illegal streaming services      The   th Collegiate Court in Mexico City overturned the decision in October       with Roku returning to the Mexican market soon after  Televisa s streaming service Blim TV would also launch on the platform      In August      Roku began to display a prominent disclaimer when non certified channels are added  warning that channels enabling piracy may be removed  without prior notice               In mid May       a software glitch caused some users to see copyright takedown notices on legitimate services such as Netflix and YouTube  Roku acknowledged and patched the glitch           Carriage disputes edit  Pay television styled carriage disputes emerged on the Roku platform in       as the company requires providers to agree to revenue sharing for subscription revenue on services that are billed through the platform  and     of advertising inventory      On September           Roku announced that NBCUniversal TV Everywhere services would be removed from its devices  as early as this weekend   due to its refusal to carry the company s streaming service Peacock under terms it deemed  unreasonable       It reached an agreement with NBCUniversal later that day      HBO Max was unavailable on Roku since its launch due until December      due to similar disputes over revenue
