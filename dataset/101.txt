       Counting the cost  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search  The Unfinished Chapels of Batalha Monastery  construction was abandoned in      and the vaulted ceiling was never concluded  Counting the Cost  or in the NIV  The Cost of Being a Disciple or in the NRSV  The Cost of Discipleship or in the NKJV  Leaving All to Follow Christ  are titles given to the Gospel of Luke passage Luke          which includes a pair of parables told by Jesus  The first title comes from the phrase  count the cost   which occurs in the King James Version of the passage  as well as some other versions   Contents    Narrative   Interpretation   See also   References   Narrative edit  The two parables are as follows   Large crowds were traveling with Jesus  and turning to them he said   If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother  wife and children  brothers and sisters yes  even their own life such a person cannot be my disciple  And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple   Suppose one of you wants to build a tower  Won t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it  For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it  everyone who sees it will ridicule you  saying   This person began to build and wasn t able to finish     Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king  Won t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand  If he is not able  he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace  In the same way  those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples   Luke           NIV Interpretation edit  Joel B  Green suggests that it is unclear what kind of tower is being referred to in the first parable     but notes that the message is that a  thoroughgoing fidelity to God s salvific aim     is required   manifest in one s identity as a disciple of Jesus      This involves putting family and possessions second     as in Matthew         and Luke          This verse is of great importance to Anabaptist groups such as the Hutterites and Bruderhof who interpret it as a call to live without private property or possessions      To them   to forsake all that he has  is an instruction to give up everything in the service of Jesus   See also edit  Life of Jesus in the New Testament Luke    Ministry of Jesus References edit      a b c Joel B  Green  The Gospel of Luke
