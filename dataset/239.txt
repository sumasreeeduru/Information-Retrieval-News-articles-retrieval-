winner in the South Dakota and California      Democratic Party presidential primaries during the      United States presidential election  He was pronounced dead at      a m  PDT on June    about    hours after he had been shot     Following dual victories in the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States  Senator Kennedy spoke to journalists and campaign workers at a live televised celebration from the stage of his headquarters at the Ambassador Hotel  Shortly after leaving the podium and exiting through a kitchen hallway

was    years old in      when he visited the British Mandate of Palestine and wrote dispatches for The Boston Post about the trip and its effect on him     During his stay  he wrote that he grew to admire the Jewish inhabitants of the area  and he became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel when he became a Senator     Appointed United States Attorney General in December      by his brother  President John Fitzgerald Kennedy  he served in that post from January      until his resignation on September          in order to run for election to the United States Senate  Opposing incumbent Republican Kenneth Keating  his first attempt at elective office scored a tight race win in an otherwise landslide Democratic Party year  He took office as Senator from New York on January             The run up to the      presidential election under President Lyndon B  Johnson was a period of great social unrest  There were riots in major cities amid Johnson s attempts to introduce anti poverty and anti discrimination legislation  and there was significant opposition to the ongoing Vietnam War          The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr  on April          led to further riots in several cities      Kennedy entered the race for the Democratic Party s nomination for president on March     four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received a large percentage of the vote in the New Hampshire primary against the incumbent President     percent to Johnson s    percent       Two weeks later  President Johnson announced that he was no longer seeking re election  and Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced that he would seek the presidency a month later  Humphrey did not participate in any primaries  but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates  Following the California primary  Kennedy was in second place with     delegates compared to Humphrey s     and McCarthy s           Assassination  Kennedy addressing supporters in the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel The      California presidential primary elections were held on Tuesday  June    The statewide results gave Kennedy    percent and McCarthy    percent  Four hours after the polls closed in California  Kennedy claimed victory in the state s Democratic presidential primary  He spoke by phone with South Dakota Senator George McGovern  At approximately       a m  PDT on June    he addressed his campaign supporters in the Ambassador Hotel s Embassy Room ballroom in the Mid Wilshire district of Los Angeles      At the time  the government provided Secret Service protection for an incumbent president  but not for presidential candidates  Kennedy s only security was provided by former FBI agent William Barry and two unofficial bodyguards  Olympic decathlon gold medalist Rafer Johnson and former football player Rosey Grier      Kennedy had welcomed contact with the public during the campaign  and people had often tried to touch him in their excitement      Kennedy planned to walk through the ballroom when he had finished speaking  He ended the speech by stating   My thanks to all of you  and now it s on to Chicago  and let s win there       He was on his way to another gathering of supporters elsewhere in the hotel      Reporters wanted a press conference  and campaign aide Fred Dutton decided that Kennedy would forgo the second gathering and instead go through the hotel s kitchen and pantry area behind the ballroom to the press area  Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said   No  it s been changed  We re going this way       Barry and Dutton began clearing a way for Kennedy to go left through swinging doors to the kitchen corridor  but Kennedy was hemmed in by the crowd and followed ma tre d h tel Karl Uecker through a back exit      Uecker led Kennedy through the kitchen area  holding his right wrist  but frequently releasing it as Kennedy shook hands with people whom he encountered      Uecker and Kennedy started down a passageway narrowed by an ice machine against the right wall and a steam table to the left      Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with busboy Juan Romero      just as Sirhan Sirhan stepped down from a low tray stacker beside the ice machine  rushed past Uecker  and repeatedly fired an eight shot     Long Rifle caliber Iver Johnson Cadet    A revolver      Kennedy fell to the floor  and bodyguard William Barry hit Sirhan twice in the face while others  including writer George Plimpton and Grier  forced him against the steam table and disarmed him  as he continued firing his gun in random directions      Five other people were wounded  William Weisel of ABC News  Paul Schrade of the United Automobile Workers union  Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans  Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service  and Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll      After a minute  Sirhan wrestled free and grabbed the revolver again  but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued      Barry went to Kennedy and placed his jacket under the candidate s head  later recalling   I knew immediately it was a      a small caliber  so I hoped it wouldn t be so bad  but then I saw the hole in the Senator s head  and I knew       Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions  contributing to the confusion and chaos  As Kennedy lay wounded  Juan Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand      Kennedy asked Romero   Is everybody OK   and Romero responded   Yes  everybody s OK   Kennedy then turned away and said   Everything s going to be OK           This moment was captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times and became the iconic image of the assassination              There was some initial confusion concerning who was shot  one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy s campaign manager and brother in law Stephen Edward Smith  Another witness stated that a female in a polka dot dress had exclaimed repeatedly   We killed him   before running away  Video footage of the witness s testimony can be seen in the Netflix series Bobby Kennedy for President  Kennedy s wife Ethel was three months pregnant  she stood outside the crush of people at the scene seeking help      She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him  He turned his head and seemed to recognize her      Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor      Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy had  a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face  as if he knew it would all end this way       After several minutes  medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher  prompting him to whisper   Don t lift me   which were his last words          as he lost consciousness shortly after      He was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital  where he arrived near death  One doctor slapped his face  calling   Bob  Bob   while another doctor manually massaged his heart      After obtaining a good heartbeat  doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so that she could hear his heart beating      After about    minutes  Kennedy was transferred several blocks to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan to undergo surgery  A gymnasium near the hospital was set up as temporary headquarters for the press and news media to receive updates on his condition  Surgery began at      a m  and lasted three hours and    minutes      At      p m  on Wednesday  spokesman Frank Mankiewicz announced that Kennedy s doctors were  concerned over his continuing failure to show improvement   his condition remained  extremely critical as to life       Kennedy had been shot three times  One bullet was fired at a range of perhaps   inch    cm  and entered behind his right ear  dispersing fragments throughout his brain      The other two entered at the rear of his right armpit  one exited from his chest and the other lodged in the back of his neck      Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain  he was pronounced dead at      a m  on June    nearly    hours after the shooting      Frank Mankiewicz left the hospital and walked to the gymnasium where the press and news media were set up for continuous updates on the situation  At   a m  on June    Mankiewicz approached the podium  took a few moments to compose himself  and made the official announcement    I have a short announcement to read  which I will read at this time  Senator Robert Francis Kennedy died at      a m   June          With Senator Kennedy at the time of his death were his wife Ethel  his sisters Mrs  Stephen Smith  Mrs  Patricia Lawford  his brother in law Mr  Stephen Smith and his sister in law Mrs  John F  Kennedy  He was    years old  Thank you      Perpetrator Main article  Sirhan Sirhan  The assassin  Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan  born March           is a Palestinian Arab with Jordanian citizenship  born in Jerusalem  who held strongly anti Zionist beliefs          A diary was found during a search of his home  and he wrote on May      My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more and more of an unshakable obsession  RFK must die  RFK must be killed  Robert F  Kennedy must be assassinated     Robert F  Kennedy must be assassinated before   June          It has been suggested that the date of the assassination is significant because it was the first anniversary of the start of the Six Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors      When Sirhan was booked by police  they found a newspaper article in his pocket that discussed Kennedy s support for Israel  Sirhan testified at his trial that he began to hate Kennedy after learning of this support          In       he told David Frost in prison   My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those    bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians       Some scholars view the assassination as one of the first major incidents of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab Israeli conflict in the Middle East      The interpretation that Sirhan was motivated by Middle Eastern politics has been criticized as an oversimplification which ignores his psychological problems      Sirhan s lawyers attempted to use a defense of diminished responsibility during the trial      while Sirhan himself tried to confess to the crime and change his plea to guilty on several occasions      He testified that he had killed Kennedy  with    years of malice aforethought   The judge did not accept this confession and it was later withdrawn          Sirhan was convicted of the murder of Robert Kennedy on April           and was sentenced six days later  to death      In       the sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated all pending death sentences that were imposed prior to       due to its ruling in California v  Anderson  Since that time  Sirhan has been denied parole    times and is currently confined at the Richard J  Donovan Correctional Facility in southern San Diego County      His lawyers have claimed that he was framed  and he claims to have no memory of his crime       Assassin s gun The Iver Johnson     caliber revolver that Sirhan Sirhan used to assassinate Robert F  Kennedy originated from Albert Leslie Hertz  a resident of Alhambra just south of Pasadena  California  He originally bought the gun to protect his own business during the      Watts riots  but never used it and kept it in its original wrapping paper and box  Hertz s wife decided the gun was too dangerous and gave it to her daughter  Dana Westlake  Westlake did not use it and gave the gun to her next door neighbor  George Erhard  Erhard later sold the gun to Sirhan Sirhan s brother  Munir Bishara Sirhan  known as  Joe   who George knew was working at Nash s department store at the corner of Arroyo and Colorado in Pasadena  At the time  Erhard was looking to seek more money from the gun sale to finance some work on his car      In the interview with the Los Angeles Police Department  Munir said that his brother asked him to obtain a gun because he wanted to visit a rifle range  Munir explained to them that rifle ranges rented guns  in which Sirhan replied  I don t want to get involved  I don t want a signature   Sirhan later asked him if he knew any gun owners  and Munir told investigators that  I don t know why my brother wanted it  you know  wanted anything to do with guns   This request was because Sirhan was a non citizen  it was illegal under California law for an alien to purchase firearms  Munir later approached Erhard in the parking lot of Nash s store and Erhard showed him the pistol  At this point  Munir said that he asked Erhard to bring the gun to Sirhan s house  since his brother was interested in buying it  He stated that he and Erhard went to Sirhan Sirhan s home and met him at the dining room  where the three agreed to a sale price  Munir produced     and Sirhan paid the    balance  However  the LAPD Summary Report stated that       On June           a polygraph examination was administered to Munir Sirhan to determine his truthfulness regarding the gun and whether or not Erhard had ever been in the Sirhan home  Munir Sirhan s responses to questions indicated he was being untruthful        Munir       admitted that he was lying when he said Erhard had been inside his home       He corrected himself and stated he had asked Erhard if he had any guns for sale and that eventually Erhard showed him the     caliber revolver  He examined the gun in the parking lot of Nash s Department Store        After examining the gun  he told Erhard he did not have sufficient money to purchase the gun at that time  He asked Erhard to bring the gun to the corner of El Molino and Howard Streets in Pasadena later that evening and told him that he would have the money to purchase the gun  Munir stated that he and Sirhan were together when Erhard came to deliver the gun  Munir Sirhan then stated that Sirhan Sirhan had been the one who bought the gun  Munir was again informed that the polygraph test showed that he had actually purchased the gun  Munir Sirhan refused to change his story  It is likely that Munir and Sirhan purchased the gun in such a clandestine manner because they were both aware that it was unlawful for aliens to own handguns  Sirhan first shot the gun in March      and practiced with it about a half dozen times between March and May       He said he  liked guns    Munir said Sirhan kept the gun in the glove compartment of his De Soto  Munir often heard Sirhan playing with something that made a  click  click  sound  and he believed it was the gun   Munir had been  frightened  by the look in Sirhan s eye when his brother handled the gun  In fact Munir was so worried he made Sirhan swear on their dead sister  Aida  that he would not use the gun in a  bad  way  Sirhan had violated three California laws merely by possessing the pistol he used to kill Robert Kennedy  Thus  if Sirhan were simply an unwitting patsy involved in a conspiracy  the conspirators must have knowingly chosen a man who had been risking the whole conspiratorial venture by possessing an illegal weapon and firing it at a police range  Had Sirhan been caught with the illegal weapon  the purported conspiracy would have collapsed       Media coverage At the time of the shooting  NBC and ABC News were signing off from their electoral broadcasts  while the CBS coverage had already concluded      CBS coverage began    minutes after the shooting with Joseph Benti  then preparing his anchoring duties for The CBS Morning News  from the election studio at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York  Walter Cronkite joined him a half hour later  Mike Wallace had co anchored the primary election coverage with Cronkite and Benti  and he appeared briefly after the shooting  CBS reporters Terry Drinkwater and David Schumacher delivered on camera updates and interviews from the Ambassador  colleagues Roger Mudd and John Hart phoned in reports to New York  Later  Mudd presented on camera updates on Kennedy s condition from Good Samaritan Hospital  At ABC  Howard K  Smith signed off and the closing billboard aired followed by a wide studio shot of Smith  co anchor Bill Lawrence  and staff with the graphic  Race to the White House  California Primary  on screen  accompanied by the John Philip Sousa march The Thunderer as theme music   When the theme completed  after a moment of silence and a  please stand by  announcement  a portion of the theme was played again  Announcer Carl Caruso then alerted viewers to  please stand by for a special report   with the wide shot and graphic still on air  as the theme played a third time  During the long static shot  the ABC camera captured live the panic and bewilderment in the New York studio  Two and a half minutes more passed before Smith returned to air to say   Ladies and gentlemen  we have kept the air on because we have heard an alarming report that Robert Kennedy was shot in that ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles   Smith would clarify that word was received about the sound of gunfire a short time earlier  but they had waited to receive additional confirmation about what happened before making any announcements   Meanwhile  the ABC reporters at the Ambassador crowded into the kitchen where Kennedy had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability      ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported  but all of ABC s coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white          One of the ABC reporters at the Ambassador was Bob Clark  who had also reported from Dallas on the assassination of John F  Kennedy  Clark and Marlene Sanders later reported from Good Samaritan Hospital  At about      a m  EST  Frank Reynolds joined Smith at the New York anchor desk  with additional contributions by Roger Grimsby  newly transferred to ABC s flagship station WABC TV and science editor Jules Bergman  Sam Donaldson contributed reports from the ABC bureau in Washington  NBC was also about to sign off in New York when anchor Frank McGee received a telephone call on camera  apparently informing him of the shooting  A visibly stunned McGee spent the next few minutes filling time until he was ready to inform viewers that Kennedy had been shot  NBC reporter Charles Quinn was one of the first to report from the scene of the shooting  telling viewers   He s lying here on the floor  Senator Kennedy has been shot  He s been shot  There s blood on the floor   Quinn and colleague Lew Allison gave updates and conducted interviews from the hotel ballroom and lobby  Sander Vanocur reported from a temporary studio in the hotel  interviewing eyewitnesses and others involved in events surrounding the shooting  NBC anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley had co anchored the primary coverage with McGee  and they returned to the Burbank anchor desk at about      a m  EST  Jack Perkins reported for NBC from Good Samaritan Hospital  CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting s aftermath on color film  which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident      Mutual News was among the first to broadcast a report from the assassination location  because reporter Andrew West of KRKD  a Mutual Broadcasting System radio affiliate in Los Angeles  captured on audio tape the sounds of the immediate aftermath of the shooting but not the actual shooting itself  using his reel to reel tape recorder and attached microphone  He had just recorded Kennedy s victory speech from the podium  and he followed Kennedy and his entourage to the kitchen pantry  West turned his recorder on again seconds after Kennedy was shot and started reporting the developments  Several seconds later  West gave an on the spot account of the struggle with Sirhan in the hotel kitchen pantry  shouting at Rafer Johnson to  Get the gun  Rafer  get the gun   and telling others to  get a hold of his thumb and break it  if you have to  Get his thumb  Hold him  hold him  We don t want another Oswald        Reporter West finished his audio recording  went to a telephone  connected his tape recorder  and called Mutual West in San Francisco  co located with radio stations KKHI AM FM  Producer John Hawkins had shut down KKHI Mutual West operations at midnight and was heading out the door  but answered the unexpected call  Hawkins recalls West screaming  roll a tape  Kennedy s been shot  roll a tape   Hawkins recorded as West spoke a live introduction then played his tape  Hawkins sent the complete recording to Mutual s New York headquarters over a dedicated line  Soon after  Mutual News broadcast Andrew West s dramatic report to all radio stations which were monitoring for Mutual News bulletins overnight  As additional Mutual News stations returned to the air or resumed newscasts  often at     AM  West s report was widely broadcast  and picked up by other stations and networks  KKHI radio could have been the first to broadcast West s report just after midnight  but it was already off the air until     AM  KKHI AM FM were classical music stations   Los Angeles CBS radio affiliate KNX  AM  interrupted its rundown of local primary returns to provide coverage of the shooting  KNX also simulcast coverage from KNXT TV  now KCBS TV  with anchor Jerry Dunphy  which was also fed nationwide on the CBS Radio Network in the initial hours after the shooting      Over the following week  NBC devoted    hours to the shooting and aftermath  ABC     and CBS     with all three networks preempting their regular coverage and advertisements to cover the story       Conspiracy theories Main article  Robert F  Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories As with the      assassination of his brother  President John F  Kennedy  Robert Kennedy s death has been the subject of widespread analysis  Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime  or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case       CIA involvement theory In November       the BBC s Newsnight program presented research by filmmaker Shane O Sullivan alleging that several CIA officers were present on the night of the assassination      Three men who appear in films and photographs from the night of the assassination were positively identified by former colleagues and associates as former senior CIA officers who had worked together in      at JMWAVE  the CIA s main anti Castro station based in Miami  They were JMWAVE Chief of Operations David Morales  Chief of Maritime Operations Gordon Campbell and Chief of Psychological Warfare Operations George Joannides          However  several people who had known Morales  including family members  were adamant that he was not the man who O Sullivan said was Morales      After O Sullivan published his book  assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and David Talbot also discovered that Campbell had died of a heart attack in       six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy      In response  O Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell s name as an alias      He then took his identifications to the Los Angeles Police Department whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens  two Bulova sales managers attending the company s convention in the Ambassador      O Sullivan stood by his allegations stating that the Bulova watch company was a  well known CIA cover        Second gunman theory The location of Kennedy s wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him  because some witnesses assert that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east      This has led to the suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot  a possibility supported by Chief Medical Examiner and Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy s right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch      Other witnesses  though  said that Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands as Sirhan approached  facing north and so exposing his right side      During a re examination of the case in       the U S  Supreme Court ordered expert examination of the possibility of a second gun having been used  and the conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory          As recently as       eyewitness John Pilger asserted his belief that there must have been a second gunman      In       it was revealed that forensic expert Philip Van Praag had analyzed an audiotape of the shooting known as the Pruszynski recording in which Van Praag had discovered acoustic evidence that a second gun had been involved in the assassination  Van Praag found that    shots were fired even though Sirhan s gun held only eight rounds  its maximum bullet capacity  and Sirhan had no opportunity to reload it          Van Praag states the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible from Sirhan s gun alone  Forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena examined Van Praag s findings and corroborated the presence of more than eight gunshots on the tape along with over lapping shots  all of this indicating the presence of a second shooter  Similar corroboration came from forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B  Brixen in Copenhagen         and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta      Other acoustic experts  however  have claimed that they could find no more than eight shots recorded on the audiotape      The Pruszynski recording was uncovered in      by CNN s Brad Johnson  its existence had been unknown to the general public previously      On February           Sirhan s lawyers William Francis Pepper and Laurie Dusek filed a court brief in U S  District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second gunman fired the shots that killed Kennedy  It was the fourth and final in a series of federal briefs filed under the writ of habeas corpus by Pepper and Dusek beginning in October           Judge Beverly Reid O Connell denied the petition in            Aftermath and legacy Memorial  Robert Kennedy s grave in Arlington National Cemetery Following Kennedy s autopsy on June    his remains were taken to Manhattan  where his closed casket was viewed by thousands at St  Patrick s Cathedral  The funeral mass was held on the morning of June              Robert Kennedy s eulogy   Final    seconds of Ted Kennedy s eulogy of Robert F  Kennedy at St  Patrick s Cathedral Problems playing this file  See media help   Kennedy s younger brother  Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy  delivered the eulogy     with the words   My brother need not be idealized  or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life  to be remembered simply as a good and decent man  who saw wrong and tried to right it  saw suffering and tried to heal it  saw war and tried to stop it  Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today  pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will someday come to pass for all the world  As he said many times  in many parts of this nation  to those he touched and who sought to touch him   Some men see things as they are and say why  I dream things that never were and say why not   Immediately following the mass  Kennedy s body was transported by a slow moving train to Washington  D C   and thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations  paying their respects as the train passed by      On the way to the cemetery  the funeral procession passed through Resurrection City  a shantytown protest set up as part of the Poor People s Campaign      The procession stopped in front of the Lincoln Memorial  where residents of Resurrection City joined the group and sang  The Battle Hymn of the Republic           Kennedy was buried near his older brother John  in Arlington National Cemetery  in the first burial to have ever taken place there at night  the second was the burial of his younger brother Ted in               After Kennedy s assassination  Congress altered the Secret Service s mandate to include protection for presidential candidates      The remaining candidates were immediately protected under an executive order issued by Lyndon Johnson  putting a strain on the poorly resourced Secret Service            election At the time of his death  Kennedy was substantially behind Humphrey in convention delegate support      but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary          Only thirteen states held primaries that year  meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference  Historian and senior Kennedy campaign advisor Arthur M  Schlesinger Jr   and others have argued that Kennedy s broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the      Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination      Historian Michael Beschloss believed that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination      Humphrey  after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets  was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground  He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of      percent to      percent  Nixon won by a more decisive         margin in the electoral vote   Cultural and societal impact Kennedy s assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent     s          Juan Romero  the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot  later said   It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second       Jack Newfield  a reporter who had been traveling with the campaign  expressed his feelings on the effect of the assassination  closing his memoir on Kennedy with   Now I realized what makes our generation unique  what defines us apart from those who came before the hopeful winter of       and those who came after the murderous spring of       We are the first generation that learned from experience  in our innocent twenties  that things were not really getting better  that we shall not overcome  We felt  by the time we reached thirty  that we had already glimpsed the most compassionate leaders our nation could produce  and they had all been assassinated  And from this time forward  things would get worse  our best political leaders were part of memory
