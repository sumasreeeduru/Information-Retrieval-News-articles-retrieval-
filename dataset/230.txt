Ages  postal delivery in France was not organised by the state and was provided by private enterprise  University envoys dominated the market from the   th century onwards  In       King Louis XI created coaching inns to deliver his own letters  These inns were for temporary use and usually led to battlefields  In       royal mail delivery was further improved with the creation of the office of royal envoy  Royal envoys were allowed to provide services to private individuals  They prefigured modern postal services and their existence led to the appearance of the first post offices at the end of the   th century     The first set fees appeared in      for letters sent to Bordeaux  Lyon  Toulouse and Dijon  As with the rest of Europe  stamps did not exist in France at that time and mail was paid for by the recipient  The first map of post roads was published in      and a book compiling lists of roads and inns including distances and fees to be paid was released in       A new edition was released every two years until       The country already had     coaching inns in      and the figure reached     at the beginning of the   th century   A ferme g n rale was created for mail services in       which meant that postal services started to be subject to taxation  Tax officers progressively bought private postal companies and university envoys became subjects to the ferme g n rale in       International treaties regarding postal services were signed with neighbouring countries under Louis XIV      Birth of a national postal service edit   The  Black Ceres   the first stamp issued in France  During the French Revolution French postal services progressively became a fully public service  Directors of post offices lost their privileges in      and their position became subject to universal suffrage  The ferme g n rale was abolished two years later and post offices started to be directly administered by the state  As a reaction to commonplace opening of letters by the royal authorities  an oath of confidentiality became compulsory for post employees in       The first French mail coach appeared in      and the first telegram in the world was delivered in      with the Chappe optical transmitter on the Paris Lille line     After the Revolution  French postal services continued their modernisation  An      decree reasserted the state monopoly on mail delivery  postal orders were created in      and postage stamps were introduced in       nine years after they were invented in the United Kingdom  A rural service was implemented in      with a mail delivery in rural areas every two days  The delivery became daily from          France was a founding member of the General Postal Union in       It became the Universal Postal Union in           French PTT edit  Post and telegraphs were united in one administration by the French government in       giving birth to the P T   Postes et t l graphes   which later became the PTT   Postes  t l graphes et t l phones    A French ministry of post and telegraphs was created the same year  A national savings bank opened in      and was added to the services provided by the P T  The government took a monopoly over telephone services in      and placed this responsibility under the P T     The administration then became PTT and kept this name until      when it became  Postes et T l communications   although the acronym PTT was kept  Postal cheques were created in       The first airmail flight operated in      between Nancy and Lun ville and a regular airmail network was put

compete anymore in a country where communication was greatly increasing  The administration suffered from a constant lack of innovation and was dependent on political will and decisions  A division between postal and telecommunication services was suggested as soon as      in a report from the French parliament  However  changes in the structure of the PTT were opposed by trade unions who feared that employees could lose their status of civil servants  In       under the premiership of Socialist Michel Rocard  a law was finally prepared to split the PTT  The aim of the government was to get the services out of the public administration and to prepare competition from private firms  Such a move was encouraged by the European Economic Community  and the United Kingdom had already separated its national telephone company from its postal services in       Most of the other member states did the same in the late     s and early     s  Trade unions organised several strikes but the law was adopted in       La Poste and France T l com were officially created on   January       The two had the status of  autonomous operators under public law   While France Telecom was privatised and floated on the stock exchange in       La Post has remained a public service  Since its creation  the company has had to face strong competition from the Internet  As a result  it has tried to innovate and diversify its activities  In       it became a webmail provider and created GeoPost  its logistics and parcel delivery subsidiary  The following year  it released its online trading platform to reinforce its online banking services  To comply with the law and EU directives  the banking activities had to form a distinct subsidiary in       called La Banque postale  It received the official status of a bank while it had remained a public savings bank until then      After      edit   A contemporary pillar box in Gif sur Yvette  La Poste lost its monopoly on postal delivery in       Since then  several competing firms have started business in France  Most of them only deliver parcels  for example  TNT Express  DHL Express and United Parcel Service  or recorded letters  while mail delivery itself has yet to attract private companies  Most of the companies dealing with mail services only operate on a local scale  because they cannot compete with the extremely wide network of offices La Poste enjoys throughout the country     La Poste became a public limited company in       Although most of the Western European countries have fully privatised their postal service companies  public opinion in France is largely against such a move  A majority of French citizens fear that if La Poste becomes a private company  many post offices would close  rural areas would be neglected and stamps would be more expensive  Supporters of privatisation claim that it would help solving the debt       billions in       and contain the rise of prices     In      La Poste invested around    billion in renovating post offices  modernising infrastructure and reinforcing its network  along with the purchase of electric delivery vehicles  Acquisitions included more Seur franchises in Spain  a     stake in Indian parcel firm DTDC and a similar stake in French parcel firm Colizen  The company also bought a     stake in freight forwarder Tigers  Via its joint venture with Swiss
