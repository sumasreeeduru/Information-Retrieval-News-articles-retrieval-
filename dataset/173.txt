rupee stamp shows George V with the  Secretariat Building  and Dominion Columns  Calcutta  now Kolkata  was the capital of India during the British Raj  until December       Calcutta had become the centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century  which led to the Partition of Bengal by then Viceroy of British India  Lord Curzon  This created massive political and religious upsurge including political assassinations of British officials in Calcutta  The anti colonial sentiments amongst the public led to a complete boycott of British goods  which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and immediately shift the capital to New Delhi     Old Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate  most notably of the Mughal Empire from      to       During the early     s  a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire  as India was officially named  from Calcutta on the east coast  to Delhi     The Government of British India felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from Delhi  which is in the centre of northern India     The land for building the new city of Delhi was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act           During the Delhi Durbar on    December       George V  then Emperor of India  along with Queen Mary  his consort  made the announcement         that the capital of the Raj was to be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi  while laying the foundation stone for the viceroy s residence in the Coronation Park  Kingsway Camp          The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V and Queen Mary at the site of Delhi Durbar of      at Kingsway Camp on    December           during their imperial visit  Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens  who first visited Delhi in       and Herbert Baker  both leading   th century British architects      The contract was given to Sobha Singh  The original plan called for its construction in Tughlaqabad  inside the Tughlaqabad Fort  but this was given up because of the Delhi Calcutta trunk line that passed through the fort  Construction really began after World War I and was completed by       The gardening and planning of plantations was in charge of A E P  Griessen  and later William Mustoe      The city that was later dubbed  Lutyens  Delhi  was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on    February      by Lord Irwin  the Viceroy      Lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain s imperial aspirations          Soon Lutyens started considering other places  Indeed  the Delhi Town Planning Committee  set up to plan the new imperial capital  with George Swinton as chairman  and John A  Brodie and Lutyens as members  submitted reports for both north and south sites  However  it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high  The central axis of New Delhi  which today faces east at India Gate  was previously meant to be a north south axis linking the Viceroy s House at one end with Paharganj at the other  Eventually  owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites on the north side  the committee settled on the south site      A site atop the Raisina Hill  formerly Raisina Village  a Meo village  was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan  then known as the Viceroy s House  The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel  which was also considered the site of Indraprastha  the ancient region of Delhi  Subsequently  the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of            where the Coronation Pillar stood  and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat  The Rajpath  also known as King s Way  stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan  The Secretariat building  the two blocks of which flank the Rashtrapati Bhawan and houses ministries of the government of India  and the Parliament House  both designed by Baker  are located at the Sansad Marg and run parallel to the Rajpath  In the south  land up to Safdarjung s Tomb was acquired to create what is today known as Lutyens  Bungalow Zone      Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of Raisina Hill  a circular railway line around the Council House  now Parliament House   called the Imperial Delhi Railway  was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years  The last stumbling block was the Agra Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All India War Memorial  India Gate  and Kingsway  Rajpath   which was a problem because the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city at that time  The line was shifted to run along the Yamuna River  and it began operating in       The New Delhi Railway Station opened in       with a single platform at Ajmeri Gate near Paharganj  and was completed in time for the city s inauguration in               As construction of the Viceroy s House  the present Rashtrapati Bhavan   Central Secretariat  Parliament House  and All India War Memorial  India Gate  was winding down  the building of a shopping district and a new plaza  Connaught Place  began in       and was completed by       Named after Prince Arthur   st Duke of Connaught              it was designed by Robert Tor Russell  chief architect to the Public Works Department  PWD       After the capital of India moved to Delhi  a temporary secretariat building was constructed in a few months in      in North Delhi  Most of the government offices of the new capital moved here from the  Old secretariat  in Old Delhi  the building now houses the Delhi Legislative Assembly   a decade before the new capital was inaugurated in       Many employees were brought into the new capital from distant parts of India  including the Bengal Presidency and Madras Presidency  Subsequently  housing for them has developed around Gole Market area in the     s      Built in the     s  to house government employees  with bungalows for senior officials in the nearby Lodhi Estate area  Lodhi colony near historic Lodhi Gardens  was the last residential areas built by the British Raj       Post independence edit   Rashtrapati Bhavan  the home of the President of India After India gained independence in       limited autonomy was conferred to New Delhi and was administered by a Chief Commissioner appointed by the Government of India  In       Delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant Governor  The Constitution  Sixty ninth Amendment  Act       declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi      A system was introduced under which the elected government was given wide powers  excluding law and order which remained with the Central Government  The actual enforcement of the legislation came in       The first major extension of New Delhi outside of Lutyens  Delhi came in the     s when the Central Public Works Department  CPWD  developed a large area of land southwest of Lutyens  Delhi to create the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri  where land was allotted for embassies  chanceries  high commissions and residences of ambassadors  around a wide central vista  Shanti Path       Geography edit   The city of New Delhi is located within the National Capital Territory of Delhi  With a total area of      km        sq mi      New Delhi forms a small part of the Delhi metropolitan area      Since the city is located on the Indo Gangetic Plain  there is little difference in elevation across the city  New Delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the Aravali Range  all that is left of those mountains is the Delhi Ridge  which is also called the Lungs of Delhi  While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the Yamuna River  it is essentially a landlocked city  East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara  New Delhi falls under the seismic zone IV  making it vulnerable to earthquakes       Seismology edit  New Delhi lies on several fault lines and thus experiences frequent earthquakes  most of them of mild intensity  There was a spike in the number of earthquakes between      and       most notable being a     magnitude earthquake in      with its epicentre in Nepal  a     magnitude earthquake on    November       a     magnitude earthquake on   September       a     magnitude earthquake on   March       and a swarm of twelve earthquakes  including four of magnitudes                and      on    November        Climate edit

winter in terms of both temperature and rainfall  The temperature varies from     C       F  in summers to around    C      F  in winters  The area s version of a humid subtropical climate is noticeably different from many other cities with this climate classification in that it features long and very hot summers with dust storms  relatively dry and mild winters with wildfire haze  and a monsoonal period  Summers are long  extending from early April to October  with the monsoon season occurring in the middle of the summer  Winter starts in November and peaks in January  The annual
