the third millennium BCE  Other settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi  including the eastern    and western regions of the Emirate       Etymology edit   Abu  is Arabic for father  and  Dhabi  is the Arabic word for gazelle  Abu Dhabi means  Father of Gazelle   It is thought that this name came about because of the abundance of gazelles in the area and a folk tale involving Shakhbut bin Dhiyab al Nahyan          Origins of Al Nahyan edit  Main article  Al Nahyan family The Bani Yas bedouin was originally centered on the Liwa Oasis in the western region of the Emirate  This tribe was the most significant in the area  having over    subsections  In       the Al Bu Falah subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi on the coast of the Persian Gulf due to the discovery of freshwater there  One family within this section was the Nahyan family  which is now the ruling family of Abu Dhabi       Pearl trade edit   Decorated stone cup from Umm Al Nar site  Abu Dhabi on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi The pearl diving business was a key industry prior to the discovery of oil reserves  According to a source about pearling  the Persian Gulf was the best location for pearls      Pearl divers dive for one to one and a half minutes and would have dived up to thirty times per day  There were no air tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was

and the sheikhs of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf  Britain became the predominant influence in the area      The main purpose of British interest was to protect the trade route to India from pirates  hence  the earlier name for the area  the  Pirate Coast   After piracy was suppressed  other considerations came into play  such as a strategic need of the British to exclude other powers from the region  Following their withdrawal from India in       the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew       First oil discoveries edit  In the mid to late     s  as the pearl trade declined  interest grew in the oil possibilities of the region  On   January       Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd  PDTC   an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company  entered into a concession agreement with the ruler  Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan  to explore for oil  This was followed by a seventy five year concession signed in January       However  owing to the desert terrain  inland exploration was fraught with difficulties  In       D Arcy Exploration Company  the exploration arm of BP  obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession  Abu Dhabi Marine Areas  ADMA  was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Fran aise des P troles  later Total   In       using a marine drilling platform  the ADMA Enterprise  oil was struck in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about       metres        ft   This was followed in      by PDTC s onshore discovery well at Murban No        In       the company discovered the Bu Hasa field and ADMA followed in      with the discovery of the Zakum offshore field  Today  in addition to the oil fields
