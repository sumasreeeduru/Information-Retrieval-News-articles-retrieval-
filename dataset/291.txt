National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami  Florida  Approximately     men voted for Miami s incorporation in      in the building to the left  The Tequesta tribe occupied the Miami area for around       years before contact with Europeans  A village of hundreds of people  dating to         B C   was located at the mouth of the Miami River  It is believed that the entire tribe migrated to Cuba by the mid     s      In       admiral Pedro Men ndez de Avil s  Florida s first governor  claimed the area for Spain  A Spanish mission was constructed one year later  Spain and Britain successively ruled Florida until Spain ceded it to the United States in       In       the U S  built Fort Dallas on the banks of the Miami River as part of its development of the Florida Territory and its attempt to suppress and remove the Seminoles  As a result  the Miami area became a site of fighting in the Second Seminole War  Miami is noted as the only major city in the United States founded by a woman  Julia Tuttle  a local citrus grower and a wealthy Cleveland native  was the original owner of the land upon which the city was built      In the late   th century  the area was known as  Biscayne Bay Country   and reports described it as a promising wilderness and  one of the finest building sites in Florida           The Great Freeze of         hastened Miami s growth  as the crops there were the only ones in Florida that survived  Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced railroad tycoon Henry Flagler to extend his Florida East Coast Railway to the region  for which she became known as  the mother of Miami           Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July           with a population of just over          It was named for the Miami River  derived from Mayaimi  the historic name of Lake Okeechobee and the Native Americans that lived around it        The mouth of the Miami River at Brickell Key African American labor played a crucial role in Miami s early development  During the early   th century  migrants from the Bahamas and African Americans constituted    percent of the city s population         Despite their role in the city s growth  their community was limited to a small space  When landlords began to rent homes to African Americans around Avenue J  what would later become NW Fifth Avenue   a gang of white men with torches marched through the neighborhood and warned the residents to move or be bombed         Miami prospered during the     s with an increase in population and infrastructure as northerners moved to the city  The legacy of Jim Crow was embedded in these developments  Miami s chief of police at the time  H  Leslie Quigg  did not hide the fact that he  like many other white Miami police officers  was a member of the Ku Klux Klan  Unsurprisingly  these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law  Quigg  for example   personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman          The collapse of the Florida land boom of the     s  the      Miami Hurricane  and the Great Depression in the     s slowed development  When World War II began  Miami became a base for U S  defense against German submarines due to its prime location on the southern coast of Florida  This brought an increase in Miami s population          people lived in the city by       The city s nickname  The Magic City  came from its rapid growth  which was noticed by winter visitors who remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic      After Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba following the Revolution in       many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami  further increasing the city s population  Miami developed new businesses and cultural amenities as part of the New South in the     s and     s  At the same time  South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars  immigration from Haiti and Latin America  and the widespread destruction of Hurricane Andrew      Racial and cultural tensions sometimes sparked  but the city developed in the latter half of the   th century as a major international  financial  and cultural center  It is the second largest U S  city with a Spanish speaking majority  after El Paso  Texas   and the largest city with a Cuban American plurality       Geography edit  Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east  which extends from Lake Okeechobee southward to Florida Bay  The elevation of the area averages at around   ft      m      above sea level in most neighborhoods  especially near the coast  The highest points are found along the Miami Rock Ridge  which lies under most of the eastern Miami metro  The main portion of the city is on the shores of Biscayne Bay  which contains several hundred natural and artificial barrier islands  the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach  The Gulf Stream  a warm ocean current  runs northward just    miles     km  off the coast  allowing the city s climate to stay warm and mild all year   Geology edit   View from one of the higher points in Miami  west of downtown  The highest natural point in the city of Miami is in Coconut Grove  near the bay  along the Miami Rock Ridge at    feet      m  above sea level      The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called Miami oolite or Miami limestone  This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil  and is no more than    feet     m  thick  Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glacial periods  or ice ages  Beginning some         years ago  the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately    feet    m  above the current level  All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea  Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau  stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas  The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon  and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans  Starting about         years ago  the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels  exposing the floor of the lagoon  By        years ago  the sea level had dropped     to     feet     to     m  below the current level  The sea level rose quickly after that  stabilizing at the current level about       years ago  leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level      Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer  a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay  It comes closest to the surface around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah      Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from the Biscayne Aquifer  As a result of the aquifer  it is not possible to dig more than    to    ft    to   m  beneath the city without hitting water  which impedes underground construction  though some underground parking garages exist  For this reason  the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at grade      Most of the western fringes of the city border the Everglades  a tropical marshland covering most of the southern portion of Florida  Alligators that live in the marshes have ventured into Miami communities and onto major highways      In land area  Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States  According to the U S  Census Bureau  the city encompasses a total area of       sq mi        km    of which       sq mi       km   is land and       sq mi       km   is water  That means Miami comprises over         people in about    square miles     km    making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States  along with New York City  San Francisco  Boston  Chicago  and Philadelphia       Cityscape edit  See also  List of tallest
