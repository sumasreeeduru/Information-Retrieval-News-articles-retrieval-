Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire  today a city in Greece  He was the second son of a tobacco and shipping merchant named Ibrahim Agha  who also served as an Ottoman commander of a small unit in Kavala        His mother was Zeynep  the daughter of the  Ayan of Kavala   orbaci Husain Agha  When his father died at a young age  Muhammad was taken and raised by his uncle with his cousins  As a reward for Muhammad Ali s hard work  his uncle gave him the rank of  Bolukbashi  for the collection of taxes in the town of Kavala      Muhammad Ali later married his cousin Amina Hanim  a wealthy widow  She was the daughter of Ali Agha and Kadriye  sister of Zeynep  After Muhammad s promising success in collecting taxes  he gained Second Commander rank under his cousin Sarechesme Halil Agha in the Kavala Volunteer Contingent of Albanian mercenaries that was sent to re occupy Egypt following General Napoleon Bonaparte s withdrawal      In       his unit was sent  as part of a much larger Ottoman force  to re occupy Egypt following a brief French occupation that threatened the way of life in Egypt  The expedition consisting of Xebec landed at Aboukir in the spring of          One of his trusted army commanders was Miralay  Mustafa Bey  who had married Muhammad s sister Zubayda and was the ancestor of the Yakan family      Rise to power edit  Main article  Muhammad Ali s seizure of power The French withdrawal left a power vacuum in Egypt  Mamluk power had been weakened  but not destroyed  and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power      During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides  gaining power and prestige for himself      As the conflict drew on  the local populace grew weary of the power struggle  In       he allied with the Egyptian leader Umar Makram and Egypt s Grand Imam of al Azhar  During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between      and       Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public      In       a group of prominent Egyptians led by the ulema  scholars  savants  demanded the replacement of W li  viceroy  Ahmad Khurshid Pasha by Muhammad Ali  and the Ottomans yielded  In       though  Ali exiled Makram to Damietta  According to Abd al Rahman al Jabarti  Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali s intentions to seize power for himself      Sultan Selim III could not oppose Muhammad Ali s ascension  By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power    Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by Horace Vernet  The Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali  They controlled Egypt for more than     years  and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt  Muhammad Ali s approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership  then move against the rank and file  Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the Cairo Citadel in honour of his son  Tusun Pasha  who was to lead a military expedition into Arabia  The event was held on   March       When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel  and were surrounded and killed by Muhammad Ali s troops  b  After the leaders were killed  Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces  Muhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire  He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows   I am well aware that the  Ottoman  Empire is heading by the day toward destruction    On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom    up to the Euphrates and the Tigris      Reinventing Egypt edit   Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy  Sultan Selim III  reigned            had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire  specifically the military  along European lines to ensure that his state could compete  Selim III  however  faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus  especially from the Janissaries  the Ottoman infantry formed from the devshirme system  Consequently  Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in       Muhammad Ali  too  recognized the need to modernize  but unlike Selim  he had dispatched his chief rivals  giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III      Muhammad Ali s goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty      To do that  he had to reorganize Egyptian society  streamline the economy  train a professional bureaucracy  and build a modern military      His first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt  To accomplish this  Muhammad Ali  nationalized  all the iltizam lands of Egypt  thereby officially owning all the production of the land  He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the  tax farmers  who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt  The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land  Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties  The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on waqf endowments  which were previously tax free  Through these endowments  personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes  As well as raising revenue to fund his new military  this tax took revenue away from the local elite  Mamluks and the ulama  weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali s reforms        Muhammad Ali by Jean Fran ois Portaels       In practice  Muhammad Ali s land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt  He required all producers to sell their goods to the state  The state in turn resold Egyptian goods  within Egypt and to foreign markets  and retained the surplus  The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of long staple cotton  a new cash crop  To help improve production  he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system  largely completed by the corv e  or forced peasant labor  The new found profits also extended down to the individual farmers  as the average wage increased fourfold      In addition to bolstering the agricultural sector  Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt  His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military  Consequently  he focused on weapons production  Factories based in Cairo produced muskets and cannons  With a shipyard he built in Alexandria  he began construction of a navy  By the end of the     s  Egypt s war industries had constructed nine     gun warships and were turning out       muskets a month      However  the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production  Muhammad Ali established a textile industry in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt  While the textile industry was not successful  the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians      Muhammad Ali used contracts called concessions to build cheap infrastructure   dams and railroads   whereby foreign European companies would raise capital  build projects  and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali s government with a portion of that revenue  Ali also granted Barth lemy Prosper Enfantin permission to build technical schools modeled after the Ecole Polytechnique      Additionally  by hiring European managers  he was able to introduce industrial training to the Egyptian population  To staff his new industries  Muhammad Ali employed a corv e labor system  The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken  sometimes fleeing as far away as Syria  A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat  common ways of self maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand  so as to be unable to fire a rifle    Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in Cairo  Beyond building a functioning  industrial economy  Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy  He sent promising citizens to Europe to study  Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European style army  Students were sent to study European languages  primarily French  so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic  He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt  European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility  A by product of Muhammad Ali s training program was the establishment of a professional bureaucracy  Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali s other reforms  In the process of destroying the Mamluks  the W li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled  In doing so  Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself  He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order      Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions  however  his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry  A      study found that Ali s economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt        Muhammad Ali of Egypt  drawn by Louis Dupr   Law under Muhammad Ali edit  The purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence      Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt  Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in       in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population  By this time  Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state  which he first expressed in       by creating a state of  law and order   where Christians within Egypt can be safe  which was a way Muhammad Ali was able to pull influence from Europe      He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan  He implemented a police force  mostly well known within Cairo and Alexandria  that functioned not just as a form of authority over the law  but also as a form of a public prosecutor s office      Renovation of evidence used within the courts  that previously would not be used  started to be part of the system  the biggest one being autopsy reports  becoming an important asset among investigations and trials alike  With the use of non Shari a evidence allowed the process of law to work around the strict Shari a rule of evidence  which restricted the use of certain forms of evidence      Autopsy became an important form of evidence used within criminal law in Egypt  even being used after Muhammad s reign amongst his successors in the     s       Hakimas and the school of medicine for women edit  In       Muhammad Ali allowed Antoine Clot  known as  Clot Bey  in Egypt  to establish a School of Medicine for women      Clot Bey had been invited in      by Muhammad Ali to found the Qasral  Ayni School of Medicine at the Army hospital of Abou Zabel which later transferred to Cairo  The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons      The medical school for women would produce hakimas   doctoress       to treat women and children  French women adherents of the Saint Simonian social reform movement were living in Egypt during         and studied or provided medical care under Clot Bey s direction  French sage femme  midwife  Suzanne Voilquin writes of assisting during the cholera epidemic of           Several of the French women contracted cholera and died  Ali s military and economic goals required a healthy army and population from which young boys could be conscripted  Venereal diseases  especially syphilis  were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates  Clot Bey argued that female provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population      He believed that the untrained local dayas  midwives  were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law  male doctors could not treat women      Clot Bey s solution was a school to train female doctors  The school of medicine for women followed a French model  The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients  The following four included training in  obstetrics  pre  and post natal care  dressing wounds  cauterization  vaccination  scarification  cupping  application of leeches  identification preparation of common medicines  Students were provided housing  food  clothes and a monthly allowance from the state      Graduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt  Some stayed at the school to serve as instructors      Marriages were arranged by the state to male doctors  Once married  hakimas were given the title of Effendi  the rank of second lieutenant  and a monthly salary of     piasters      Licensed hakimas treated women and children  providing vaccinations and delivering children  They served a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of smallpox during the   th century by vaccinating approximately     children a month in the Civil Hospital      They checked and treated women  mainly prostitutes  for venereal diseases      Another important task was the  forensic examination      of women  In this respect  hakimas operated in a legal setting  Their examination was used as evidence in cases involving unnatural death  suspected premarital loss of virginity  or miscarriage      Although one task of the hakimas was overseeing childbirth  the majority of the population continued to use the dayas      Hakimas performed almost no deliveries and often were only called upon during difficult deliveries      However  dayas were required to have a certificate to perform deliveries  which could only be obtained from hakimas      They were also expected to report statistics on births to the hakimas      A significant issue was recruitment of students  Egyptian culture at the time opposed the education of women      Therefore  the first students at the medical school were young slave girls      Slaves continued to be recruited through slave auctions as well as orphans from hospices      Despite the modest success of the school and its graduates  increasing enrolment remained a consistent problem  though the limit of    students was reached in           Contemporary and modern historians have viewed the creation of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali      Khaled Fahmy argues against this view      Fahmy states that  because the reasons for the creation of the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army  the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals      For example  their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate  Furthermore  the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life  This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth  either personally or through dayas  as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman       Role in the Arabic literary renaissance edit  In the     s  Muhammad Ali sent the first educational  mission  of Egyptian students to Europe  This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance  known as the Nahda  To support the modernization of industry and the military  Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied  Rifa a al Tahtawi supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology  and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement  after the first from Greek into Arabic  In          his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World  the Bulaq Press       The Bulaq press published the official gazette of Muhammad Ali s government  Among his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of Arabian horses  In horses obtained as taxes and tribute  Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the Bedouin  particularly by the Anazeh in Syria and those bred in the Nejd  While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program  his grandson  who became Abbas I shared this interest and further built upon his work   Military campaigns edit   Muhammad Ali s flag  Though Muhammad Ali s chief aim was to establish a European style military  and carve out a personal empire  he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan  Mahmud II  in Arabia and Greece  although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire   He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military  First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to  They began housing soldiers in barracks  leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance  roll call was done several times a day  and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military      The army often used the bastinado and the whip to control and punish the soldiers      Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined  but he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment  this helped to create blind obedience to the laws      A large part of Ali s goal of a European style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers  distinguish officers from enlisted men  structure units  and properly distribute salaries      Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it  and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty      This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement  such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment      The soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks  In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps      Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins      In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place       Arabian campaign edit  Main article  Wahhabi War Muhammad Ali s first military campaign was an expedition into the Arabian Peninsula  The holy cities of Mecca  and Medina had been captured by the House of Saud  who had recently embraced a literalist Hanbali interpretation of Islam  Armed with their newfound religious zeal  the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia  This culminated in the capture of the Hejaz region by       With the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe  Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to recapture the Arabian territories  Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son  Tusun  to lead a military expedition in       The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia  however  a second attack was launched in      that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz      While the campaign was successful  the power of the Saudis was not broken  They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central Nejd region of the Peninsula  Consequently  Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons  Ibrahim  at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis  After a two year campaign  the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured  The family leader  Abdullah ibn Saud  was sent to Istanbul  and executed       Conquest of Sudan edit  Main article  Egyptian conquest of Sudan             Muhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the Porte  beginning with the Sudan which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory  gold  and slaves  The Sudan at the time had no real central authority  as since the   th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining Sultanate of Sennar  fighting each other with Medieval weaponry  In      Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of       troops commanded by his third son  Ismail and Abidin Bey  south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority      Ali s troops made headway into Sudan in       but met with fierce resistance by the Shaigiya  Ultimately  the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan      Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the Nile in Ethiopia  and Uganda  His administration captured slaves from the Nuba Mountains  and west and south Sudan  all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the Gihadiya which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains   pronounced Jihadiya in non Egyptian Arabic   Ali s reign in Sudan  and that of his immediate successors  is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy handed  contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self proclaimed Mahdi  Muhammad Ahmad  in        Greek rebellion edit  Main article  Greek War of Independence  Muhammad Ali Pasha with his son  Ibrahim  and Colonel Joseph S ve  later Suleiman Pasha   While Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa  the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories  The rebellion in the Greek provinces of the Ottoman Empire began in       The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as Constantinople  With his own army proving ineffective  Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of Crete in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt  Muhammad Ali sent        soldiers      transports  and    escort vessels under command of his son  Ibrahim Pasha      Britain  France  and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks  On    October      at the Battle of Navarino  while under the command of Muharram Bey  the Ottoman representative  the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet  under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington  If the Porte was not in the least prepared for this confrontation  Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent  expensively assembled and maintained navy  With its fleet essentially destroyed  Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw  Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains   War against the sultan edit  Main article  Egyptian Ottoman War             In compensation for his loss at Navarino  Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of Syria  The Ottomans were indifferent to the request  the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed      But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference  To compensate for his and Egypt s losses  the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion  Like other rulers of Egypt before him  Ali desired to control Bilad al Sham  the Levant   both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources  nor was this a sudden  vindictive decision on the part of Ali since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt s unofficial ruler  For not only had Syria abundant natural resources  it also had a thriving international trading community with well developed markets throughout the Levant  in addition  it would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt  Yet perhaps most of all  Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan  A new fleet was built  a new army was raised and on    October       under Ibrahim Pasha  the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the First Turko Egyptian War  For the sake of appearance on the world stage  a pretext for the invasion was vital  Ultimately  the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with Abdullah Pasha of Acre  The W li alleged that       fellahin had fled to Acre to escape the draft  corv e  and taxes  and he wanted them back       See also       Arab revolt in Palestine  The Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease  The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre  The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six month siege  which lasted from   November      to    May       Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege  Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden  After the fall of Acre  the Egyptian army marched north into Anatolia  At the Battle of Konya     December        Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the sadr azam Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha  There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim s forces and Constantinople itself  Through the course of the campaign  Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers  Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains  he proceeded slowly and cautiously  For example  Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan s name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness      So long as Muhammad Ali s march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state  the powers in Europe remained as passive observers      Despite this show  Muhammad Ali s goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and replace him with the sultan s son  the infant Abd lmecid  This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia s offer of military aid resulting in the Treaty of H nk r  skelesi      Russia s gain dismayed the British and French governments  resulting in their direct intervention  From this position  the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May      known as the Convention of Kutahya      The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of Crete  then known as Candia  and the Hijaz as compensation  and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W li of Syria  The peace agreement fell short  however  of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself  leaving him wanting        Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria         with Patrick Campbell in the centre  After David Roberts  in The Holy Land  Syria  Idumea  Arabia  Egypt  and Nubia Sensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains  the sultan attempted to pre empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence      Muhammad Ali rejected the offer  knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete  On    May       Muhammad Ali informed Britain  and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire      This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire      With Muhammad Ali s intentions clear  the European powers  particularly Russia  attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict  Within the Empire  however  both sides were gearing for war  Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria  In Constantinople  the Ottoman commander  Hafiz Pasha  assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army  When Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier  Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the Battle of Nezib     June       near Urfa  In an echo of the Battle of Konya  Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali s forces  A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali      Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen year old Abd lmecid  At this point  Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow  Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family  At this point  the European powers again intervened  see Oriental Crisis of        On    July       the British Government  which had colluded with Austria  Prussia  and Russia to sign the Convention of London  offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon  Muhammad Ali hesitated  believing he had support from France  His hesitation proved costly  France eventually backed down as King Louis Philippe did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers  especially at a time when he also had to deal with the Rhine crisis  So British naval forces moved against Syria  and Alexandria      In the face of European military might  Muhammad Ali acquiesced  After the British  and Austrian navies blockaded the Nile delta coastline  shelled Beirut     September        and after Acre had capitulated    November        Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on    November       These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete  and Hejaz  downsizing his navy  and reducing his standing army to        men  provided that he and his descendants would enjoy hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan  an unheard of status for an Ottoman viceroy       Final years edit   The Mosque of Muhammad Ali in Cairo  Egypt After       fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle  and the treaty of Balta Liman  which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers  and to give up its monopolies  Muhammad Ali s mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia  Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the silver nitrate he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate      In      the tax receipts were in  and Sherif Pasha  the head of the diwan al maliyya  financial ministry   was too fearful for his life to tell Ali the news that Egyptian debt now stood at    million francs               Tax arrears came to            piastres c  out of a total estimated tax of            pts

to break the news  It did little  if any  good  The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected  and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold  A year later while Ibrahim  progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis  he was beginning to cough up blood   was sent to Italy to take the waters  Muhammad Ali  in       travelled to Constantinople  There he approached the Sultan  expressed his fears  and made his peace  explaining    My son  Ibrahim is old and sick   my grandson  Abbas is indolent  happa   and then children will rule Egypt  How will they keep Egypt       After he secured hereditary rule for his family  the Wali ruled until       when senility made further governance by him impossible    Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo It soon came to the point where his son and heir  the mortally ailing Ibrahim  had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive  However  on the ship returning home  Ibrahim  gripped by fever and guilt  succumbed to seizures and hallucinations  He survived the journey but within six months was dead  He was succeeded by his nephew  Tosun s son  Abbas I  By this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son s death  Lingering a few months more  Muhammad Ali died at Ras el Tin Palace in Alexandria on   August       and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the Cairo Citadel  But the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key  thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather  Eyewitness British consul John Murray wrote       the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre  miserable affair  the  diplomatic  Consular was not invited to attend  and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed   in short  a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather  in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner  and in neglecting to attend them in person      the  attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer  The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country  the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious  vacillating government of his successor  all classes whether Turk  or Arab  not only feel  but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali   In truth my Lord  it cannot be denied  that Muhammad Ali  notwithstanding all his faults was a great man      Legacy edit   A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by David Wilkie         The prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the  Father of Modern Egypt   being the first ruler since the Ottoman conquest in      to permanently divest the Porte of its power in Egypt  While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime  he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state  In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm  he built a central bureaucracy  an educational system that allowed social mobility  and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop  cotton  and military based manufacturing  His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly     years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state      Others  however  view him not as a builder  but rather as a conqueror  He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian  and throughout his reign  Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic  Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends  not Egyptian national ones  with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous  Taken together in this light  Muhammad Ali is cast by some as another in a long line of foreign conquerors dating back to the Persian occupation in     B C      This view  however  is at odds with the majority opinion of Egyptian  and other Arab historians  and Egyptian public opinion      Much of the historical debate regarding Muhammad Ali reflects the simultaneous political struggles which occurred in Egypt during the   th century  Fuad I of Egypt in the     s sponsored the collection  arrangement  and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors  which became the Royal Archives of Egypt  These Royal Archives represented the primary and  in the case of some important works      the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the     s  Fuad s portrayal of Muhammad Ali as a nationalist and benevolent monarch therefore heavily influenced the historical debate  Later  Nasser and his revolutionary republican regime promoted an alternative narrative which portrayed Muhammad Ali as the nationalist founder of modern Egypt but also an ambitious monarch with little regard for his people whose policies ultimately benefited himself and his dynasty at the expense of Egypt       See also

Muhammad Ali s first name in both Arabic and Ottoman Turkish was consistent        Muhammad   This is the name by which he was known to his Egyptian subjects  and the name used uniformly in Egyptian and Arabic language historical scholarship  However  given his original status as a commander in the Ottoman military  his first name is often rendered as Mehmed  which is the standard rendition of that name in Ottoman Turkish  or Mehmet in Albanian  Current English language historical scholarship is divided as to which is preferable  with the majority opinion favoring the former  Typically  historians accentuating the Egyptian character of his rule opt for Muhammad  whilst those accentuating the Ottoman character opt for Mehmed or Mehmet  This distinction is an issue for those writing in the Latin alphabet  but not in Arabic        Reports vary about how many died  William Cleveland claims    killed while H  Wood Jarvis claims nearly      Whatever the actual number  it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks             A piastre is forty paras  A para is the smallest Egyptian silver coin  In this instance  a piastre can be viewed as approximately     of a
