collaborative media        participatory journalism  citation needed  democratic journalism     guerrilla journalism    or street journalism     is based upon public citizens  playing an active role in the process of collecting  reporting  analyzing  and disseminating news and information      Similarly  Courtney C  Radsch defines citizen journalism  as an alternative and activist form of news gathering and reporting that functions outside mainstream media institutions  often as a response to shortcomings in the professional journalistic field  that uses similar journalistic practices but is driven by different objectives and ideals and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy than traditional or mainstream journalism      Jay Rosen offers a simpler definition   When the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another      The underlying principle of citizen journalism is that ordinary people  not professional journalists  can be the main creators and distributors or news     Citizen journalism should not be confused with  community journalism or civic journalism  both of which are practiced by professional journalists  collaborative journalism  which is the practice of professional and non professional journalists working together     and social journalism  which denotes a digital publication with a hybrid of professional and non professional journalism  Citizen journalism is a specific form of both citizen media and user generated content  UGC   By juxtaposing the term  citizen   with its attendant qualities of civic mindedness and social responsibility  with that of  journalism   which refers to a particular profession  Courtney C  Radsch argues that this term best describes this particular form of online and digital journalism conducted by amateurs  because it underscores the link between the practice of journalism and its relation to the political and public sphere      Citizen journalism was made more feasible by the development of various online internet platforms     New media technology  such as social networking and media sharing websites  in addition to the increasing prevalence of cellular telephones  have made citizen journalism more accessible to people worldwide  Recent advances in new media have started to have a profound political impact      Due to the availability of technology  citizens often can report breaking news more quickly than traditional media reporters  Notable examples of citizen journalism reporting from major world events are  the      Haiti earthquake  the Arab Spring  the Occupy Wall Street movement  the      protests in Turkey  the Euromaidan events in Ukraine  and Syrian Civil War  the      Ferguson unrest and the Black Lives Matter movement  Being that Citizen journalism is yet to develop a conceptual framework and guiding principles  it can be heavily opinionated and subjective  making it more supplemental than primary in terms of forming public opinion     Critics of the phenomenon  including professional journalists and news organizations  claim that citizen journalism is unregulated  amateur  and haphazard in quality and coverage  Furthermore  Citizen journalists  due to their lack of professional affiliation  are thought to lack resources as well as focus on how best to serve the public

journalism  as a form of alternative media  presents a  radical challenge to the professionalized and institutionalized practices of the mainstream media       According to Flew  there have been three elements critical to the rise of citizen journalism  open publishing  collaborative editing  and distributed content      Mark Glaser said in             people without professional journalism training can use the tools of modern technology and the global distribution of the Internet to create  augment or fact check media on their own or in collaboration with others  In What is Participatory Journalism              J  D  Lasica classifies media for citizen journalism into the following types   Audience participation  such as user comments attached to news stories  personal blogs  photographs or video footage captured from personal mobile cameras  or local news written by residents of a community  Independent news and information Websites  Consumer Reports  the Drudge Report  Full fledged participatory news sites  one convo  NowPublic  OhmyNews  DigitalJournal com  GroundReport   Fair Observer   Collaborative and contributory media sites  Slashdot  Kuro hin  Newsvine  Other kinds of  thin media   mailing lists  email newsletters  Personal broadcasting sites  video broadcast sites such as KenRadio  The literature of citizen  alternative  and participatory journalism is most often situated in a democratic context and theorized as a response to corporate news media dominated by an economic logic  Some scholars have sought to extend the study of citizen journalism beyond the developed Western world  including Sylvia Moretzsohn      Courtney C  Radsch      and Clemencia Rodr guez      Radsch  for example  wrote that  Throughout the Arab world  citizen journalists have emerged as the vanguard of new social movements dedicated to promoting human rights and democratic values        Theories of citizenship edit  According to Vincent Campbell  theories of citizenship can be categorized into two core groups  those that consider journalism for citizenship  and those that consider journalism as citizenship  The classical model of citizenship is the base of the two theories of citizenship  The classical model is rooted in the ideology of informed citizens and places emphasis on the role of journalists rather than on citizens      The classical model has four main characteristics   journalists  role of informing citizens citizens are assumed to be informed if they regularly attend to the news they are supplied with more informed citizens are more likely to participate the more informed citizens participate  the more democratic a state is more likely to be      The first characteristic upholds the theory that journalism is for citizens  One of the main issues with this is that there is a normative judgement surrounding the amount and nature of information that citizens should have as well as what the relationship between the two should be  One branch of journalism for citizens is the  monitorial citizen   coined by Michael Schudson   The  monitorial citizen  suggests that citizens appropriately and strategically select what news and information they consume  The  monitorial citizen  along with other forms of this ideology conceive individuals as those who do things with information to enact change and citizenship  However  this production of information does not equal to an act of citizenship  but instead an act of journalism  Therefore  citizens and journalists are portrayed as distinctive roles whereas journalism is used by citizens for citizenship and conversely  journalists serve citizens      The second theory considers journalism as citizenship  This theory focuses on the different aspects of citizen identity and activity and understands citizen journalism as directly constituting citizenship  The term  liquid citizenship   coined by Zizi Papacharissi  depicts how the lifestyles that individuals engage in allow them to interact with other individuals and organizations  which thus remaps the conceptual periphery of civic  political  and social  This  liquid citizenship  allows the interactions and experiences that individuals face to become citizen journalism where they create their own forms of journalism  An alternative approach of journalism as citizenship rests between the distinction between  dutiful  citizens and  actualizing  citizens   Dutiful  citizens engage in traditional citizenship practices  while  actualizing  citizens engage in non traditional citizenship practices  This alternative approach suggests that  actualizing  citizens are less likely to use traditional media and more likely to use online and social media as sources of information  discussion  and participation  Thus  journalism in the form of online and social media practices become a form of citizenship for actualizing citizens      Criticisms have been made against citizen journalism  especially from among professionals in the field  Citizen journalists are often portrayed as unreliable  biased and untrained    as opposed to professionals who have  recognition  paid work  unionized labour and behaviour that is often politically neutral and unaffiliated  at least in the claim if not in the actuality        History edit  The idea that every citizen can engage in acts of journalism has a long history in the United States  The contemporary citizen journalist movement emerged after journalists began to question the predictability of their coverage of events such as the      U S  presidential election  Those journalists became part of the public  or civic  journalism movement  which sought to counter the erosion of trust in the news media and the widespread disillusionment with politics and civic affairs              Initially  discussions of public journalism focused on promoting journalism that was  for the people  by changing the way professional reporters did their work  According to Leonard Witt  however  early public journalism efforts were  often part of  special projects  that were expensive  time consuming  and episodic  Too often these projects dealt with an issue and moved on  Professional journalists were driving the discussion  They would have the goal of doing a story on welfare to work  or the environment  or traffic problems  or the economy   and then they would recruit a cross section of citizens and chronicle their points of view  Since not all reporters and editors bought into this form of public journalism  and some outright opposed it  reaching out to the people from the newsroom was never an easy task   By       in fact  the movement seemed to be petering out  with the Pew Center for Civic Journalism closing its doors  citation needed  Traditionally  the term  citizen journalism  has had a history of struggle with deliberating on a concise and mutually agreed upon definition  Even today  the term lacks a clear form of conceptualization  Although the term lacks conceptualization  alternative names of the term are unable to comprehensively capture the phenomenon  For example  one of  the interchangeable names with  citizen journalism  is  user generated content   UGC   However  the issue with this alternative term is that it eliminates the potential civic virtues of citizen journalism and considers it to be stunted and proprietorial      With today s technology the citizen journalist movement has found new life as the average person can capture news and distribute it globally  As Yochai Benkler has noted   the capacity to make meaning    to encode and decode humanly meaningful statements    and the capacity to communicate one s meaning around the world  are held by  or readily available to  at least many hundreds of millions of users around the globe       Professor Mary Rose Papandrea  a constitutional law professor at Boston College  notes in her article  Citizen Journalism and the Reporter s Privilege  that        i n many ways  the definition of  journalist  has now come full circle  When the First Amendment of the U S  Constitution was adopted   freedom of the press  referred quite literally to the freedom to publish using a printing press  rather than the freedom of organized entities engaged in the publishing business    It was not until the late nineteenth century that the concept of the  press  metamorphized into a description of individuals and companies engaged in an often competitive commercial media enterprise  A recent when   trend in citizen journalism has been the emergence of what blogger Jeff Jarvis terms hyperlocal journalism  as online news sites invite contributions from local residents of their subscription areas  who often report on topics that conventional newspapers tend to ignore       We are the traditional journalism model turned upside down   explains Mary Lou Fulton  the publisher of the Northwest Voice in Bakersfield  California   Instead of being the gatekeeper  telling people that what s important to them  isn t news   we re just opening up the gates and letting people come on in  We are a better community newspaper for having thousands of readers who serve as the eyes and ears for the Voice  rather than having everything filtered through the views of a small group of reporters and editors        Citizen journalists edit  According to Jay Rosen  citizen journalists are  the people formerly known as the audience   who  were on the receiving end of a media system that ran one way  in a broadcasting pattern  with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak very loudly while the rest of the population listened in isolation from one another  and who today are not in a situation like that at all      The people formerly known as the audience are simply the public made realer  less fictional  more able  less predictable       Abraham Zapruder  who filmed the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy with a home movie camera  is sometimes presented as an ancestor to citizen journalists      Egyptian citizen Wael Abbas was awarded several international reporting prizes for his blog Misr Digital  Digital Egypt  and a video he publicized of two policemen beating a bus driver helped lead to their conviction      During      many eyewitness accounts of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center came from citizen journalists  Images and stories from citizen journalists close to the World Trade Center offered content that played a major role in the story          In       when the     magnitude underwater earthquake caused a huge tsunami in Banda Aceh Indonesia and across the Indian Ocean  a weblog based virtual network of previously unrelated bloggers emerged that covered the news in real time  and became a vital source for the traditional media for the first week after the tsunami      A large amount of news footage from many people who experienced the tsunami was widely broadcast      as well as a good deal of  on the scene  citizen reporting and blogger analysis that was subsequently picked up by the major media outlets worldwide      Subsequent to the citizen journalism coverage of the disaster and aftermath  researchers have suggested that citizen journalists may  in fact  play a critical role in the disaster warning system itself  potentially with higher reliability than the networks of tsunami warning equipment based on technology alone which then require interpretation by disinterested third parties      The microblog Twitter played an important role during the      Iranian election protests  after foreign journalists had effectively been  barred from reporting   Twitter delayed scheduled maintenance during the protests that would have shut down coverage in Iran due to the role it played in public communication      Social media platforms such as blogs  YouTube  and Twitter encourage and facilitate engagement with other citizens who participate in creating content through commenting  liking  linking  and sharing  The majority of the content produced by these amateur news bloggers was not original content  but curated information monitored and edited by these various bloggers  There has been a decline in the amateur news blogger due to social media platforms that are much easier to run and maintain  allowing individuals to easily share and create and content      Wikimedia Foundation hosts a participatory journalism web site  Wikinews       Citizen journalism in a worldwide context edit  India edit   the world s biggest democracy       India has a broad media landscape expanding at  double digit growth rates       in comparison to the West  Issues surrounding human rights violations  violence against women and everyday witness accounts          Most notably  images shared on Twitter during the      Mumbai attacks is an example of citizen journalism in India       Iraq edit  In      Daylight Magazine sent a box of disposable cameras to be distributed to civilians living in Baghdad and Fallujah  These were published in May      along with the work of seminal documentarians such as Susan Meiselas  Roger Hutchings  etc  In June      Fred Ritchen and Pixel Press teamed up with Daylight to create a touring exhibition of the images and captions which went to various institutions around the United States including  The Council on Foreign Relations  The Center for Photography Woodstock  New York University  Union College  Michigan University  and Central Michigan University before being donated to the Archive of Documentary Art at Duke University  citation needed   United Kingdom edit  Citizen Journalism provides a platform for individuals to be considered and acknowledged on a global scale  The circulation of information and news does not fully divulge the accurate perceptions of what is going on in the world  For instance  On Our Radar contains reporting mechanisms and trained residents that reveal their voices while questioning the reluctance journalism has when considering what voices are heard and are not  based in London  On Our Radar has undertaken in making the voices in Sierra Leone heard in regards to Ebola  revealing that it contained easy access to vital sources of  information and opened more opportunities for questions and reports      Depending on the country one resides in  as societies evolve  grow  and depend more on online media outlets there is an increase of informed individuals  especially with topics regarding politics and government news  Through such evolution  citizen journalism has the capability to reach an audience that has not had the privilege of receiving higher education and still remain informed about what is surrounding them and their respective country      As demonstrated in light of demanding and distorted information given to the mass public and cleared by strong demonstrations of the capabilities of citizen journalism  Citizen journalism is a platform that provides a solution to the mistrust the public has towards the government as discrepancies arise from governmental statements and actions   China edit  Citizen journalism has created much change and influence within Chinese media and society in which its online activity is very much controlled  The interconnection built from citizen journalism and mainstream journalism in China has allotted politically and socially charged information to be distributed to promote progressive changes and serves as national sentiments  In doing so  the mass public of China has the opportunities to move around the controlled and monitored online presence and the information it contains      Citizen journalists face many repercussions when unpackaging the truth and reach domestic and global audiences  Most if not all of these repercussions result from government officials and law enforcement from the journalists respective countries  Citizen journalists are needed and depended on by the mass public but are viewed as an imminent threat to their governments  The public has had the resources to pursue this level of journalism from their surroundings and based on real life perspectives that lack censorship and influence from a higher entity  The various forms citizen journalism is formed has outdated many news and media sources as result of the authentic approach citizen journalists carry out      In the context of China and the national pandemic rooted from the coronavirus  many voices were censored and limited when it came to citizen journalists  This occurred in the process of visually and vocally documenting the social climate of China in regards to the coronavirus  For instance  a citizen journalist who is chinese posted videos of Wuhan  China as the outbreak had been spreading globally  As a result the journalist was stopped and detained by the police and was not released for two months  In sharing their experience being detained after being released the tone it was expressed in was marketed  This citizen journalist experience is one amongst more of who were similarly detained and censored       Criticisms edit  Objectivity edit  Citizen journalists also may be activists within the communities they write about  This has drawn some criticism from traditional media institutions such as The New York Times  which have accused proponents of public journalism of abandoning the traditional goal of objectivity  Many traditional journalists view citizen journalism with some skepticism  believing that only trained journalists can understand the exactitude and ethics involved in reporting news  See  e g   Nicholas Lemann  Vincent Maher  and Tom Grubisich  An academic paper by Vincent Maher  the head of the New Media Lab at Rhodes University  outlined several weaknesses in the claims made by citizen journalists  in terms of the  three deadly E s   referring to ethics  economics  and epistemology      An analysis by language and linguistics professor  Patricia Bou Franch  found that some citizen journalists resorted to abuse sustaining discourses naturalizing violence against women  She found that these discourses were then challenged by others who questioned the gendered ideologies of male violence against women       Quality edit  An article in      by Tom Grubisich reviewed ten new citizen journalism sites and found many of them lacking in quality and content      Grubisich followed up a year later with   Potemkin Village Redux       He found that the best sites had improved editorially and were even nearing profitability  but only by not expensing editorial costs  Also according to the article  the sites with the weakest editorial content were able to expand aggressively because they had stronger financial resources  Another article published on Pressthink examined Backfence  a citizen journalism site with three initial locations in the D C  area  which reveals that the site has only attracted limited citizen contributions      The author concludes that   in fact  clicking through Backfence s pages feels like frontier land    remote  often lonely  zoned for people but not home to any  The site recently launched for Arlington  Virginia  However  without more settlers  Backfence may wind up creating more ghost towns   David Simon  a former reporter for The Baltimore Sun and writer producer of the television series The Wire criticized the concept of citizen journalism claiming that unpaid bloggers who write as a hobby cannot replace trained  professional  seasoned journalists    I am offended to think that anyone  anywhere believes American institutions as insulated  self preserving and self justifying as police departments  school systems  legislatures and chief executives can be held to gathered facts by amateurs pursuing the task without compensation  training or for that matter  sufficient standing to make public officials even care to whom it is they are lying to   An editorial published by The Digital Journalist web magazine expressed a similar position  advocating to abolish the term  citizen journalist   and replacing it with  citizen news gatherer     Professional journalists cover fires  floods  crime  the legislature  and the White House every day  There is either a fire line or police line  or security  or the Secret Service who allow them to pass upon displaying credentials vetted by the departments or agencies concerned  A citizen journalist  an amateur  will always be on the outside of those lines  Imagine the White House throwing open its gates to admit everybody with a camera phone to a presidential event       While the fact that citizen journalists can report in real time and are not subject to oversight opens them to criticism about the accuracy of their reporting  news stories presented by mainstream media also misreport facts occasionally that are reported correctly by citizen journalists  As low as     of the American population have a fair amount of trust in the media       Effects on traditional journalism edit  Journalism has been affected significantly due to citizen journalism  This is because citizen journalism allows people to post as much content as they want  whenever they want  In order to stay competitive  traditional news sources are forcing their journalist to compete  This means that journalist now have to write  edit and add pictures into their content and they must do so at a rapid pace  as it is perceived by news companies that it s essential for journalist to produce content at the same rate that citizens can post content on the internet  This is hard though  as many news companies are facing budget cuts and cannot afford to pay journalists the proper amount for the amount of work they do   Despite the uncertainties of a job in journalism and rising tuition costs there has been a     increase in journalism majors throughout the past few years according to Astra Taylor in her book The People s Platform       Legal repercussions edit  Edward Greenberg  a New York City litigator      notes higher vulnerability of unprofessional journalists in court compared to the professional ones    So called shield laws  which protect reporters from revealing sources  vary from state to state  On occasion  the protection is dependent on whether the person  who  asserted the claim is in fact a journalist  There are many cases at both the state and federal levels where judges determine just who is is not a journalist  Cases involving libel often hinge on whether the actor was or was not a member of the  press        The view stated above does not mean that professional journalists are fully protected by shield laws  In the      Branzburg v  Hayes case the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated the use of the First Amendment as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a grand jury  In       the reporter s privilege of Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper was rejected by the appellate court   Possible future edit  Citizen journalism increased during the last decade of the twentieth century and into the twenty first century  associated with the creation of the internet which introduced new ways in communicating and engaging news  Due to this shift in technology  individuals were able to access more news than previously and at a much faster rate  This larger quantity also made it so there was a larger variety of sources which people were able to consume media and news  citation needed  Natalie Fenton discusses the role of citizen journalism within the digital age and has three characteristics associated with the topic  speed and space  multiplicity and poly centrality  and interactivity and participation      With technological advancements  individuals were able to participate increasingly in journalism  Pictures or videos could be uploaded online in a matter of minutes and this paved the way for social media to grow as a strong producer in the industry  The introduction of technologies such as the smartphone increased the ability to access the internet  Many large corporations have shifted their focus toward online presence  such as Facebook or YouTube  New technologies such as virtual reality may open new avenues that media companies and individuals alike will be able to exploit for
