  commonly known as the Web  is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators  URLs  such as https   example com    which may be interlinked by hypertext  and are accessible over the Internet        The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP   may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser  and are published by a software application called a web server  The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet  which pre existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built  English scientist Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web in       He wrote the first web browser in      while employed at CERN near Geneva  Switzerland        The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January       and then to the general public in August       The Web began to enter everyday use in         when websites for general use started to become available     The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age  and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet                  Web resources may be any type of downloaded media  but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language  HTML       Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to navigate to other web resources  In addition to text  web pages may contain references to images  video  audio  and software components which are either displayed or internally executed in the user s web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content  Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name  make up a website  Websites are stored in computers that are running a web server  which is a program that responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on a user s computer  Website content can be provided by a publisher  or interactively from user generated content  Websites are provided for a myriad of informative  entertainment  commercial  and governmental reasons   Contents

the World Wide Web  The NeXT Computer used by Tim Berners Lee at CERN  The corridor where WWW was born  CERN  the ground floor of building No   Tim Berners Lee s vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the     s      By       the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System  upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built  came into being  In      the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web like system at CERN      While working at CERN  Berners Lee became frustrated with the inefficiencies and difficulties posed by finding information stored on different computers      On    March       he submitted a memorandum  titled  Information Management  A Proposal       to the management at CERN for a system called  Mesh  that referenced ENQUIRE  a database and software project he had built in       which used the term  web  and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded as text   Imagine  then  the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred  so that while reading this document  you could skip to them with a click of the mouse   Such a system  he explained  could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext  a term that he says was coined in the     s  There is no reason  the proposal continues  why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics  speech and video  so that Berners Lee goes on to use the term hypermedia      With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on    November      to build a  Hypertext project  called  WorldWideWeb   one word  as a  web  of  hypertext documents  to be viewed by  browsers  using a client server architecture      At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test  This proposal estimated that a read only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve  the creation of new links and new material by readers   so that  authorship becomes universal  as well as  the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him her has become available   While the read only goal was met  accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature  with the wiki concept  WebDAV  blogs  Web     and RSS Atom        The CERN data centre in      housing some WWW servers The proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology  a spin off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University  The Dynatext system  licensed by CERN  was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO           to Hypermedia within HyTime  but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community  namely a fee for each document and each document alteration  citation needed  A NeXT Computer was used by Berners Lee as the world s first web server and also to write the first web browser in       By Christmas       Berners Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web      the first web browser  WorldWideWeb  which was a web editor as well  and the first web server  The first web site      which described the project itself  was published on    December           The first web page may be lost  but Paul Jones of UNC Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May      that Berners Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a visit to UNC in       Jones stored it on a magneto optical drive and on his NeXT computer      On   August       Berners Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt hypertext      This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers  which had occurred months earlier  As another example of such confusion  several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners Lee in       an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro  Gennaro has disclaimed this story  writing that media were  totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism       The first server outside Europe was installed in December      at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center  SLAC  in Palo Alto  California  to host the SPIRES HEP database                  The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the     s  such as the Hypertext Editing System  HES  at Brown University  Ted Nelson s Project Xanadu  and Douglas Engelbart s oN Line System  NLS   Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush s microfilm based memex  which was described in the      essay  As We May Think       Berners Lee s breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet  In his book Weaving The Web  he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of both technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible  But  when no one took up his invitation  he finally assumed the project himself  In the process  he developed three essential technologies   a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere  the universal document identifier  UDI   later known as uniform resource locator  URL  and uniform resource identifier  URI   the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language  HTML   the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP       The World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time  The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones  making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource  It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers  in comparison to earlier systems   but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot  Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard  the World Wide Web was non proprietary  making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions  On    April       CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone  with no fees due      Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use  this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web  An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Window System    Robert Cailliau  Jean Fran ois Abramatic  and Tim Berners Lee at the tenth anniversary of the World Wide Web Consortium The Web began to enter general use in         when websites for everyday use started to become available      Historians generally agree that a turning point for the Web began with the      introduction of Mosaic          a graphical web browser developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  NCSA UIUC   The development was led by Marc Andreessen  while funding came from the US High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing Act of       one of several computing developments initiated by US Senator Al Gore      Prior to the release of Mosaic  graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages  and the Web was less popular than older protocols such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers  WAIS   Mosaic s graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet  The World Wide Web Consortium  W C  was founded by Tim Berners Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research  CERN  in October       It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science  MIT LCS  with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   which had pioneered the Internet  a year later  a second site was founded at INRIA  a French national computer research lab  with support from the European Commission DG InfSo  and in       a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University  By the end of       the total number of websites was still relatively small  but many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today s most popular services  Connected by the Internet  other websites were created around the world  This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting  Berners Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards  such as the markup languages to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a Semantic Web  The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy to use and flexible format  It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet      Although the two terms are sometimes conflated in popular use  World Wide Web is not synonymous with Internet      The Web is an information space containing hyperlinked documents and other resources  identified by their URIs      It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as TCP IP and HTTP  Berners Lee was knighted in      by Queen Elizabeth II for  services to the global development of the Internet           He never patented his invention   Function edit  Main articles  HTTP and HTML  The World Wide Web functions as an application layer protocol that is run  on top of   figuratively  the Internet  helping to make it more functional  The advent of the Mosaic web browser helped to make the web much more usable  to include the display of images and moving images  GIFs   The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction  However  the two terms do not mean the same thing  The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks  In contrast  the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources  linked by hyperlinks and URIs  Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS  which are application level Internet protocols that use the Internet s transport protocols      Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource  The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page  In the     s  using a browser to view web pages and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks came to be known as  browsing    web surfing   after channel surfing   or  navigating the Web   Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers  One study  for example  found five user patterns  exploratory surfing  window surfing  evolved surfing  bounded navigation and targeted navigation      The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL http   example org home html  The browser resolves the server name of the URL  example org  into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System  DNS   This lookup returns an IP address such as             or      db   e        The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address  It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service  so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing  HTTP normally uses port number    and for HTTPS it normally uses port number      The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text   GET  home html HTTP     Host  example org  The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port     If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success   HTTP         OK Content Type  text html  charset UTF    followed by the content of the requested page  Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  for a basic web page might look like this    html     head       title Example org   The World Wide Web  title      head     body       p The World Wide Web  abbreviated as WWW and commonly known      p      body    html   The web browser parses the HTML and interprets the markup   title    p  for paragraph  and such  that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen  Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images  other embedded media  scripts that affect page behaviour  and Cascading Style Sheets that affect page layout  The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other Internet media types  As it receives their content from the web server  the browser progressively renders the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources   HTML edit  Main article  HTML Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications  With Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  and JavaScript  it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages  HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages  With HTML constructs  images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page  HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings  paragraphs  lists  links  quotes and other items  HTML elements are delineated by tags  written using angle brackets  Tags such as  img    and  input    directly introduce content into the page  Other tags such as  p  surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub elements  Browsers do not display the HTML tags  but use them to interpret the content of the page  HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript  which affects the behavior and content of web pages  Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content  The World Wide Web Consortium  W C   maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards  has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since       update       Linking edit  Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files  source documents  definitions and other web resources  In the underlying HTML  a hyperlink looks like this   a href  http   example org home html  Example org Homepage  a    Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW  demonstrating hyperlinks Such a collection of useful  related resources  interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a web of information  Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners Lee first called the WorldWideWeb  in its original CamelCase  which was subsequently discarded  in November           The hyperlink structure of the web is described by the webgraph  the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages  or URLs  the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks  Over time  many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear  relocate  or are replaced with different content  This makes hyperlinks obsolete  a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot  and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called dead links  The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites  The Internet Archive  active since       is the best known of such efforts   WWW prefix edit  Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the long standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services they provide  The hostname of a web server is often www  in the same way that it may be ftp for an FTP server  and news or nntp for a Usenet news server  These host names appear as Domain Name System  DNS  or subdomain names  as in www example com  The use of www is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it  the first web server was nxoc   cern ch      According to Paolo Palazzi      who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners Lee  the popular use of www as subdomain was accidental  the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www cern ch while info cern ch was intended to be the CERN home page  however the DNS records were never switched  and the practice of prepending www to an institution s website domain name was subsequently copied  Many established websites still use the prefix  or they employ other subdomain names such as www   secure or en for special purposes  Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name  e g   example com  and the www subdomain  e g   www example com  refer to the same site  others require one form or the other  or they may map to different web sites  The use of a subdomain name is useful for load balancing incoming web traffic by creating a CNAME record that points to a cluster of web servers  Since  currently  only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME  the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root      dubious    discuss  When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field  some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix  www  to the beginning of it and possibly   com     org  and   net  at the end  depending on what might be missing  For example  entering  microsoft  may be transformed to http   www microsoft com  and  openoffice  to http   www openoffice org  This feature started appearing in early versions of Firefox  when it still had the working title  Firebird  in early       from an earlier practice in browsers such as Lynx      unreliable source   It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in       but only for mobile devices      In English  www is usually read as double u double u double u      Some users pronounce it dub dub dub  particularly in New Zealand  Stephen Fry  in his  Podgrams  series of podcasts  pronounces it wuh wuh wuh      The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped in The Independent on Sunday          The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it s short for       In Mandarin Chinese  World Wide Web is commonly translated via a phono semantic matching to w n w i w ng        which satisfies www and literally means  myriad dimensional net       better source needed  a translation that reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web  Tim Berners Lee s web space states that World Wide Web is officially spelled as three separate words  each capitalised  with no intervening hyphens      Use of the www prefix has been declining  especially when Web     web applications sought to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable      As the mobile Web grew in popularity  services like Gmail com  Outlook com  Myspace com  Facebook com and Twitter com are most often mentioned without adding  www    or  indeed    com   to the domain   Scheme specifiers edit  The scheme specifiers http    and https    at the start of a web URI refer to Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP Secure  respectively  They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response  The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web  and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data  such as passwords or banking information  Web browsers usually automatically prepend http    to user entered URIs  if omitted   Pages edit  Main article  Web page  A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons A web page  also written as webpage  is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers  A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device  The term web page usually refers to what is visible  but may also refer to the contents of the computer file itself  which is usually a text file containing hypertext written in HTML or a comparable markup language  Typical web pages provide hypertext for browsing to other web pages via hyperlinks  often referred to as links  Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple web resource elements  such as reading style sheets  scripts  and images  while presenting each web page  On a network  a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server  The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet  The web browser uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  to make such requests to the web server  A static web page is delivered exactly as stored  as web content in the web server s file system  In contrast  a dynamic web page is generated by a web application  usually driven by server side software  Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information  for example  bank websites  web email etc   Static page edit  Main article  Static web page A static web page  sometimes called a flat page stationary page  is a web page that is delivered to the user exactly as stored  in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application  Consequently  a static web page displays the same information for all users  from all contexts  subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so   Dynamic pages edit  Main articles  Dynamic web page and Ajax  programming   Dynamic web page  example of server side scripting  PHP and MySQL  A server side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server side scripts  In server side scripting  parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds  including the setting up of more client side processing  A client side dynamic web page processes the web page using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model  or DOM  that represents the loaded web page  The same client side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way  A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content  The updating information could come from the server  or from changes made to that page s DOM  This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to  but a dynamic web page update using Ajax technologies will neither create a page to go back to  nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page  Using Ajax technologies the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM  the DOM  for its client  from an application server  DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages  though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX  a term which is now itself rarely used  Client side scripting  server side scripting  or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser  JavaScript is a scripting language that was initially developed in      by Brendan Eich  then of Netscape  for use within web pages      The standardised version is ECMAScript      To make web pages more interactive  some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as Ajax  asynchronous JavaScript and XML   Client side script is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server  either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks  or based on elapsed time  The server s responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response  so the server needs only to provide limited  incremental information  Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time  and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved  Web pages may also regularly poll the server to check whether new information is available       Website edit   The usap gov website Main article  Website A website     is a collection of related web resources including web pages  multimedia content  typically identified with a common domain name  and published on at least one web server  Notable examples are wikipedia org  google com  and amazon com  A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol  IP  network  such as the Internet  or a private local area network  LAN   by referencing a uniform resource locator  URL  that identifies the site  Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions  a website can be a personal website  a corporate website for a company  a government website  an organization website  etc  Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose  ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education  All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web  while private websites  such as a company s website for its employees  are typically a part of an intranet  Web pages  which are the building blocks of websites  are documents  typically composed in plain text interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  XHTML   They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors  Web pages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP   which may optionally employ encryption  HTTP Secure  HTTPS  to provide security and privacy for the user  The user s application  often a web browser  renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal  Hyperlinking between web pages conveys to the reader the site structure and guides the navigation of the site  which often starts with a home page containing a directory of the site web content  Some websites require user registration or subscription to access content  Examples of subscription websites include many business sites  news websites  academic journal websites  gaming websites  file sharing websites  message boards  web based email  social networking websites  websites providing real time stock market data  as well as sites providing various other services  End users can access websites on a range of devices  including desktop and laptop computers  tablet computers  smartphones and smart TVs   Browser edit  Main article  Web browser A web browser  commonly referred to as a browser  is a software user agent for accessing information on the World Wide Web  To connect to a website s server and display its pages  a user needs to have a web browser program  This is the program that the user runs to download  format and display a web page on the user s computer      In addition to allowing users to find  displaying and moving between web pages  a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks  recording history  managing cookies  see below  and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites  The most popular browsers are Chrome  Firefox  Safari  Internet Explorer  and Edge   Server edit  Main article  Web server  The inside and front of a Dell PowerEdge web server  a computer designed for rack mounting A Web server is server software  or hardware dedicated to running said software  that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests  A web server can  in general  contain one or more websites  A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols  The primary function of a web server is to store  process and deliver web pages to clients      The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP   Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents  which may include images  style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content    Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website  here  Dell servers are installed together to be used for the Wikimedia Foundation  A user agent  commonly a web browser or web crawler  initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so  The resource is typically a real file on the server s secondary storage  but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented  While the primary function is to serve content  a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients  This feature is used for submitting web forms  including uploading of files  Many generic web servers also support server side scripting using Active Server Pages  ASP   PHP  Hypertext Preprocessor   or other scripting languages  This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files  while the actual server software remains unchanged  Usually  this function is used to generate HTML documents dynamically   on the fly   as opposed to returning static documents  The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from databases  The latter is typically much faster and more easily cached but cannot deliver dynamic content  Web servers can also frequently be found embedded in devices such as printers  routers  webcams and serving only a local network  The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question  This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required  which now is included with most operating systems    Cookie edit  Main article  HTTP cookie An HTTP cookie  also called web cookie  Internet cookie  browser cookie  or simply cookie  is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user s computer by the user s web browser while the user is browsing  Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information  such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store  or to record the user s browsing activity  including clicking particular buttons  logging in  or recording which pages were visited in the past   They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names  addresses  passwords  and credit card numbers  Cookies perform essential functions in the modern web  Perhaps most importantly  authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not  and which account they are logged in with  Without such a mechanism  the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information  or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in  The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user s web browser  and on whether the cookie data is encrypted  Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie s data to be read by a hacker  used to gain access to user data  or used to gain access  with the user s credentials  to the website to which the cookie belongs  see cross site scripting and cross site request forgery for examples       Tracking cookies  and especially third party tracking cookies  are commonly used as ways to compile long term records of individuals  browsing histories   a potential privacy concern that prompted European     and U S  lawmakers to take action in               European law requires that all websites targeting European Union member states gain  informed consent  from users before storing non essential cookies on their device  Google Project Zero researcher Jann Horn describes ways cookies can be read by intermediaries  like Wi Fi hotspot providers  He recommends to use the browser in incognito mode in such circumstances       Search engine edit  Main article  Search engine  The results of a search for the term  lunar eclipse  in a web based image search engine A web search engine or Internet search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web search  Internet search   which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a web search query  The search results are generally presented in a line of results  often referred to as search engine results pages  SERPs   The information may be a mix of web pages  images  videos  infographics  articles  research papers and other types of files  Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories  Unlike web directories  which are maintained only by human editors  search engines also maintain real time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler  Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the deep web   Deep web edit  Main article  Deep web The deep web      invisible web      or hidden web     are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search engines  The opposite term to the deep web is the surface web  which is accessible to anyone using the Internet      Computer scientist Michael K  Bergman is credited with coining the term deep web in      as a search indexing term      The content of the deep web is hidden behind HTTP forms          and includes many very common uses such as web mail  online banking  and services that users must pay for  and which is protected by a paywall  such as video on demand  some online magazines and newspapers  among others  The content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a direct URL or IP address  and may require a password or other security access past the public website page   Caching edit  A web cache is a server computer located either on the public Internet  or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request  Most web browsers also implement a browser cache by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device  HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access  Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data  such as in online banking  or to facilitate frequently updated sites  such as news media  Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally  Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site wide files so that they can be cached efficiently  Enterprise firewalls often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users  Some search engines store cached content of frequently accessed websites   Security edit  For criminals  the Web has become a venue to spread malware and engage in a range of cybercrimes  including  but not limited to  identity theft  fraud  espionage and intelligence gathering      Web based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security concerns          and as measured by Google  about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code      Most web based attacks take place on legitimate websites  and most  as measured by Sophos  are hosted in the United States  China and Russia      The most common of all malware threats is SQL injection attacks against websites      Through HTML and URIs  the Web was vulnerable to attacks like cross site scripting  XSS  that came with the introduction of JavaScript     and were exacerbated to some degree by Web     and Ajax web design that favours the use of scripts      Today by one estimate      of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users      Phishing is another common threat to the Web  In February       RSA  the security division of EMC  estimated the global losses from phishing at      billion in           Two of the well known phishing methods are Covert Redirect and Open Redirect  Proposed solutions vary  Large security companies like McAfee already design governance and compliance suites to meet post      regulations      and some  like Finjan have recommended active real time inspection of programming code and all content regardless of its source      Some have argued that for enterprises to see Web security as a business opportunity rather than a cost centre      while others call for  ubiquitous  always on digital rights management  enforced in the infrastructure to replace the hundreds of companies that secure data and networks      Jonathan Zittrain has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet       Privacy edit  Main article  Internet privacy Every time a client requests a web page  the server can identify the request s IP address  Web servers usually log IP addresses in a log file  Also  unless set not to do so  most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable history feature  and usually cache much of the content locally  Unless the server browser communication uses HTTPS encryption  web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed  recorded  and cached by intermediate systems  Another way to hide personally identifiable information is by using a virtual private network  A VPN encrypts online traffic and masks the original IP address lowering the chance of user identification  When a web page asks for  and the user supplies  personally identifiable information such as their real name  address  e mail address  etc  web based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual  If the website uses HTTP cookies  username  and password authentication  or other tracking techniques  it can relate other web visits  before and after  to the identifiable information provided  In this way  it is possible for a web based organization to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites  It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities  their shopping interests  their profession  and other aspects of their demographic profile  These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketers  advertisers  and others  Depending on the website s terms and conditions and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold  shared  or passed to other organizations without the user being informed  For many ordinary people  this means little more than some unexpected e mails in their in box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page  For others  it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome  Law enforcement  counter terrorism  and espionage agencies can also identify  target  and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web  Social networking sites usually try to get users to use their real names  interests  and locations  rather than pseudonyms  as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users  On the other hand  uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual  who may regret this exposure  Employers  schools  parents  and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles  such as text posts or digital photos  that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences  Online bullies may make use of personal information to harass or stalk users  Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting  but these can be complex and not easy to find or use  especially for beginners      Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems  as they can add a person s face to an on line profile  With modern and potential facial recognition technology  it may then be possible to relate that face with other  previously anonymous  images  events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere  Due to image caching  mirroring  and copying  it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web   Standards edit  Main article  Web standards Web standards include many interdependent standards and specifications  some of which govern aspects of the Internet  not just the World Wide Web  Even when not web focused  such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and web services  Considerations include the interoperability  accessibility and usability of web pages and web sites  Web standards  in the broader sense  consist of the following   Recommendations published by the World Wide Web Consortium  W C       Living Standard  made by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group  WHATWG  Request for Comments  RFC  documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF      Standards published by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO      Standards published by Ecma International  formerly ECMA      The Unicode Standard and various Unicode Technical Reports  UTRs  published by the Unicode Consortium     Name and number registries maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  IANA      Web standards are not fixed sets of rules  but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies      Web standards are developed by standards organizations groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company  It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status  in case of W C specifications  the highest maturity level    Accessibility edit  Main article  Web accessibility There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with disabilities  These disabilities may be visual  auditory  physical  speech related  cognitive  neurological  or some combination  Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities  like a broken arm  or ageing users as their abilities change      The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society  The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is essential that the Web be accessible  so it can provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities      Tim Berners Lee once noted   The power of the Web is in its universality  Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect       Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites      International co operation in the W C Web Accessibility Initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology           Internationalisation edit  The W C Internationalisation Activity assures that web technology works in all languages  scripts  and cultures      Beginning in      or       Unicode gained ground and eventually in December      surpassed both ASCII and Western European as the Web s most frequently used character encoding       Originally RFC      allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US ASCII  RFC      allows more characters any character in the Universal Character Set and now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language        See also edit   Electronic publishing Internet metaphors Internet security Lists of websites Prestel
