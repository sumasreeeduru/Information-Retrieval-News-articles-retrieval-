influential people in politics  culture  sports  and other areas over journalistic objectivity and or integrity   Contents    Features   Criticism   See also   References   Features edit  Typical features of access journalism include   absence of demanding accountability towards the questioned respondent avoiding controversial topics so as to maintain access to the respondent pre approved questions  no gotcha questions  softball questions sometimes even respondent s control over how the interview will be edited and which parts will be aired Access journalism  in some cases  is similar to infomercials  or advertising disguised as news  The venture of doing the interview can be symbiotic beneficial for both the journalist and the celebrity  since it can synergically bring more attention to both of them  and further notability  influence  media exposure  current relevance  etc  for both of them  Access journalism has been contrasted with accountability journalism     A similar contrast is between lapdog journalism and watchdog journalism  citation needed   Criticism edit  Critics of access journalism point out that trying to be friends with important figures for access betrays the original and fundamental role of journalism  The practice was mentioned tangentially in the Outfoxed documentary  which pointed out that the most recognized journalists of the flagship programs of the mainstream media  over the time  themselves become celebrities and occasionally mingle with other celebrities  including political ones  on cocktail parties  fancy dinners  banquets  etc  and create the kind of relationship that they  as journalists  should not have  One of the most recent examples of access journalism  in conjunction of gaining views and attention  was the attempt of the media to get access and media time with Donald Trump  during the      presidential cycle  His media attractiveness resulted in free media time  worth  according to estimates  between      and      billion USD  At the height of the run  some media outlets were calling Trump daily without specific issues to ask him about  just to get his voice on air and eyeballs of curious Americans in the process   See also edit  Journalistic objectivity Andrea Mitchell Chris Cillizza Chuck Todd Maggie Haberman References edit       Access Journalism vs Accountability Journalism
