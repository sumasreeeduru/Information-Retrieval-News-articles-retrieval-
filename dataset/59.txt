groupings of outlier viewpoints in contemporary society  and is most associated with bloggers  journalists publishing in non mainstream media outlets  and the social media or  social license   The  Fifth  Estate extends the sequence of the three classical Estates of the Realm and the preceding Fourth Estate  essentially the mainstream press  The use of  fifth estate  dates to the     s counterculture  and in particular the influential The Fifth Estate  an underground newspaper first published in Detroit in       Web based technologies have enhanced the scope and power of the Fifth Estate far beyond the modest and boutique    conditions of its beginnings  Nimmo and Combs assert that political pundits constitute a Fifth Estate      Media researcher Stephen D  Cooper argues that bloggers are the Fifth Estate     William Dutton has argued that the Fifth Estate is not simply the blogging community  nor an extension of the media  but  networked individuals  enabled by the Internet  e g  social media  in ways that can hold the other estates accountable     Making reference to the medieval concept of  three estates of the realm   clergy  nobility  and commoners  and to a more recently developed model of  four estates   which encompasses the media  Nayef Al Rodhan introduces the weblogs  blogs  as a  fifth estate of the realm   Blogs have potential and real influence on contemporary policy making  especially in the context of elections  reporting from conflict zones  and raising dissent over corporate or legislative policies  Based on these observations  Al Rodhan suggests moving beyond traditional thinking that limits the  estates of the realm  to governmental action and proposes a broader perspective in which civilians or anyone with access to a computer and the Internet can contribute to the global political change and security      Blogs and social media as a Fifth Estate edit  Of all the blogs on the Internet  continues Al Rodhan  only a few have a real power to influence the policy making process  specifically political and current affairs blogs with large and involved audiences  These blogs can help organize the public to take a stance on an issue  be used in political campaigns  help cultivate grassroots movements  and assist in fundraising     Furthermore  blogs have several unique features that give them potential influence in policy making  a lack of editorial supervision  low barriers to entry  difficulty for governments to censor or control content  and the ease of responding to events in real time  Blogs can affect policy making by providing insider information  facilitating communication between experts  promoting grassroots efforts  discrediting political figures  and setting policy agendas  Blogs as  the fifth estate  are also influencing global security  They can contribute to terrorist plots by facilitating cross border communication and by connecting people whose ideas are outside of the mainstream  by propagating hateful or violent messages  or by encouraging organized crime citation needed   Despite  evidence of multiple war fronts appearing to support this claim in the early   st century  Al Rodhan concludes  governments must increase surveillance of blogs and develop legal  administrative  and technological tools to dissuade bloggers from posting potentially harmful information  such as calls to incite terrorism  On a more positive note  blogs have also the potential to prevent governments from adopting hasty and misjudged decisions     Building on this work  Wallsten    empirically assessed the impact of political bloggers as a  fifth estate  during the      US presidential campaign  Specifically  he used time series analysis to determine the extent to which political bloggers followed the mainstream media s agenda or set the mainstream media s agenda  He found that there was a complex  bidirectional relationship between mainstream media coverage and blog discussion rather than a unidirectional media or blog agenda setting effect   See also edit  Fourth branch of government Fifth power Gossip References edit           Specialized in bespoke or custom made products or
