Regression analysis    Statistical model Misleading graph vte Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty  it is that which answers the question of  What an entity is  and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics  The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts     Thus the concept becomes related to notions of constraint  communication  control  data  form  education  knowledge  meaning  understanding  mental stimuli  pattern  perception  representation  and entropy  Information is associated with data  as data represent values attributed to parameters  and information is data in context and with meaning attached  Information also relates to knowledge  as knowledge signifies understanding of an abstract or concrete concept     better source needed  In terms of communication  information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation  That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right  and in that sense  information is always conveyed as the content of a message  Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation  for example  information may be encoded into a sequence of signs  or transmitted via a signal   It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication  The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that  The more uncertain an event  the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event  The bit is a typical unit of information  but other units such as the nat may be used  For example  the information encoded in one  fair  coin flip is log           bit  and in two fair coin flips is log           bits   Contents    Etymology   Information theory approach   As sensory input   As representation and complexity   As an influence that leads to transformation   As a property in physics   The

the word and concept  information  The English word  Information  apparently derives from the Latin stem  information   of the nominative  informatio   this noun derives from the verb informare  to inform  in the sense of  to give form to the mind    to discipline    instruct    teach   Inform itself comes  via French informer  from the Latin verb informare  which means to give form  or to form an idea of  Furthermore  Latin itself already contained the word informatio meaning concept or idea  but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word information in English is not clear  The ancient Greek word for form was        morphe  cf  morph  and also        eidos   kind  idea  shape  set   the latter word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by Plato  and later Aristotle  to denote the ideal identity or essence of something  see Theory of Forms    Eidos  can also be associated with thought  proposition  or even concept  The ancient Greek word for information is             which transliterates  pl rophoria  from          pl r s   fully  and       phorein  frequentative of  pherein  to carry through  It literally means  bears fully  or  conveys fully   In modern Greek the word            is still in daily use and has the same meaning as the word information in English  In addition to its primary meaning  the word            as a symbol has deep roots in Aristotle s semiotic triangle  In this regard it can be interpreted to communicate information to the one decoding that specific type of sign  This is something that occurs frequently with the etymology of many words in ancient and modern Greek where there is a very strong denotative relationship between the signifier  e g  the word symbol that conveys a specific encoded interpretation  and the signified  e g  a concept whose meaning the interpreter attempts to decode  In English   information  is an uncountable mass noun   Information theory approach edit  Main article  Information theory In information theory  information is taken as an ordered sequence of symbols from an alphabet  say an input alphabet    and an output alphabet    Information processing consists of an input output function that maps any input sequence from   into an output sequence from    The mapping may be probabilistic or deterministic  It may have memory or be memoryless      As sensory input edit  Often information can be viewed as a type of input to an organism or system  Inputs are of two kinds  some inputs are important to the function of the organism  for example  food  or system  energy  by themselves  In his book Sensory Ecology    biophysicist David B  Dusenbery called these causal inputs  Other inputs  information  are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time  and perhaps another place   Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input  In practice  information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system  For example  light is mainly  but not only  e g  plants can grow in the direction of the lightsource  a causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information  The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak for photosynthesis but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee s nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower  where the bee often finds nectar or pollen  which are causal inputs  serving a nutritional function   As representation and complexity edit  The cognitive scientist and applied mathematician Ronaldo Vigo argues that information is a concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense  These are  any dimensionally defined category of objects S  and any of its subsets R  R  in essence  is a representation of S  or  in other words  conveys representational  and hence  conceptual  information about S  Vigo then defines the amount of information that R conveys about S as the rate of change in the complexity of S whenever the objects in R are removed from S  Under  Vigo information   pattern  invariance  complexity  representation  and information five fundamental constructs of universal science are unified under a novel mathematical framework           Among other things  the framework aims to overcome the limitations of Shannon Weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information   As an influence that leads to transformation edit  Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns        In this sense  there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive  much less appreciate  the pattern  Consider  for example  DNA  The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind  One might argue though that for a human to consciously define a pattern  for example a nucleotide  naturally involves conscious information processing  Systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense  assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind  and patterns circulating  due to feedback  in the system can be called information  In other words  it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation  though not created or presented for that purpose  For example  Gregory Bateson defines  information  as a  difference that makes a difference       If  however  the premise of  influence  implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it  the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge  Complex definitions of both  information  and  knowledge  make such semantic and logical analysis difficult  but the condition of  transformation  is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge  especially in the business discipline of knowledge management  In this practice  tools and processes are used to assist a knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions  including steps such as   Review information to effectively derive value and meaning Reference metadata if available Establish relevant context  often from many possible contexts Derive new knowledge from the information Make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledge Stewart        argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical  lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise  The Danish Dictionary of Information Terms     argues that information only provides an answer to a posed question  Whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person  So a generalized definition of the concept should be   Information    An answer to a specific question   When Marshall McLuhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures  he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets  Also  pheromones are often said to be  information  in this sense   As a property in physics edit  Main article  Physical information Information has a well defined meaning in physics  In      J  D  Bekenstein claimed that a growing trend in physics was to define the physical world as being made up of information itself  and thus information is defined in this way   see Digital physics   Examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement  where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light  Material information itself cannot travel faster than light even if that information is transmitted indirectly  This could lead to all attempts at physically observing a particle with an  entangled  relationship to another being slowed  even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry  The mathematical universe hypothesis suggests a new paradigm  in which virtually everything  from particles and fields  through biological entities and consciousness  to the multiverse itself  could be described by mathematical patterns of information  By the same token  the cosmic void can be conceived of as the absence of material information in space  setting aside the virtual particles that pop in and out of existence due to quantum fluctuations  as well as the gravitational field and the dark energy   Nothingness can be understood then as that within which no matter  energy  space  time  or any other type of information could exist  which would be possible if symmetry and structure break within the manifold of the multiverse  i e  the manifold would have tears or holes   Physical information exists beyond event horizons  since astronomical observations show that  due to the expansion of the universe  distant objects continue to pass the cosmological horizon  as seen from a present time  local observer point of view  Another link is demonstrated by the Maxwell s demon thought experiment  In this experiment  a direct relationship between information and another physical property  entropy  is demonstrated  A consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system  in practical terms this often means generating heat  Another more philosophical outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy  Toyabe et al  experimentally showed in nature that information can be converted into work      Thus  in the study of logic gates  the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an AND gate is higher than for the NOT gate  because information is destroyed in an AND gate and simply converted in a NOT gate   Physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers  In thermodynamics  information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system that can interpret the information   The application of information study edit  The information cycle  addressed as a whole or in its distinct components  is of great concern to information technology  information systems  as well as information science  These fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture  through sensors  and generation  through computation  formulation or composition   processing  including encoding  encryption  compression  packaging   transmission  including all telecommunication methods   presentation  including visualization   display methods   storage  such as magnetic or optical  including holographic methods   etc  Information

due diligence to protect information  and information systems  from unauthorized access  use  disclosure  destruction  modification  disruption or distribution  through algorithms and procedures focused on monitoring and detection  as well as incident response and repair  Information analysis is the process of inspecting  transforming  and modelling information  by converting raw data into actionable knowledge  in support of the decision making process  Information quality  shortened as InfoQ  is the potential of a dataset to achieve a specific  scientific or practical  goal using a given empirical analysis method  Information communication represents the convergence of informatics  telecommunication and audio visual media   content   Technologically mediated information edit  Further information  Information Age It is estimated that the world s technological capacity to store information grew from      optimally compressed  exabytes in        which is the informational equivalent to less than one     MB CD ROM per person      MB per person    to      optimally compressed  exabytes in           This is the informational equivalent of almost    CD ROM per person in           The world s combined technological capacity to receive information through one way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of     newspapers per person per day in           The world s combined effective capacity to exchange information through two way telecommunication networks was the informational equivalent of   newspapers per person per day in           As of       an estimated     of all new information is digital  mostly stored on hard drives       As records edit  Records are specialized forms of information  Essentially  records are information produced consciously or as by products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value  Primarily  their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value  Sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required  The international standard on records management  ISO        defines records as  information created  received  and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person  in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business       The International Committee on Archives  ICA  Committee on electronic records defined a record as   recorded information produced or received in the initiation  conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content  context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity       Records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal  fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization  Willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered     six key requirements for good corporate governance   transparency  accountability  due process  compliance  meeting statutory and common law requirements  and security of personal and corporate information        Semiotics edit  Michael Buckland has classified  information  in terms of its uses   information as process    information as knowledge   and  information as thing       Beynon Davies         explains the multi faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal sign systems  Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter dependent levels  layers or branches of semiotics  pragmatics  semantics  syntax  and empirics  These four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other  Pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication  Pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used  The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour  In other words  pragmatics link language to action  Semantics is concerned with the meaning of a message conveyed in a communicative act  Semantics considers the content of communication  Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs   the association between signs and behaviour  Semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts   particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior  Syntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent a message  Syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems  Syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign systems  Nielsen        discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries  He introduces the concept of lexicographic information costs and refers to the effort a user of a dictionary must make to first find  and then understand data so that they can generate information  Communication normally exists within the context of some social situation  The social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed  pragmatics  and the form of communication  In a communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter related signs taken from a language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication  Mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax  syntactics  and semantics  The sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel  empirics   The chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place  and over what distance   See also edit   Abstraction Accuracy and precision Anti information reduces certainty Classified
