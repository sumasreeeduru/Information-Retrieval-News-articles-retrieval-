with CBeebies  CBBC is operated by the BBC Children s department within the BBC and is part of the BBC North group  BBC Children s was originally based in the East Tower of BBC Television Centre since the department s inception  but moved to MediaCityUK in Salford in September       and the live presentation links used throughout the day are now recorded and broadcast from there  CBBC is answerable to the CBBC Channel controller Damian Kavanagh  in post since       and to the director of BBC Children s Joe Godwin  appointed in      and in charge of the whole direction of CBBC and its strand counterpart   Programming edit  Main article  List of BBC children s television programmes The remit of CBBC is to provide a wide range of high quality  distinctive content for      year olds  including comedy  entertainment  drama  animation  news and factual  The great majority of this content should be produced in the UK  CBBC should provide a stimulating  creative and enjoyable environment that is also safe and trusted  The service should have a particular focus on informal learning  with an emphasis on encouraging participation   CBBC Remit    CBBC s programming output is very similar to the strand shown on BBC One  CBBC often complements this strand with programmes shown earlier than on the terrestrial channels  repeats or whole series shown in a day  alongside other exclusive commissions   Most viewed programmes edit  The following is a list of the ten most watched shows on CBBC  based on Live    data supplied by BARB          The Sarah Jane Adventures Lost in

   Class TV edit  As part of CBBC s original remit  CBBC originally needed to show     hours a year of factual and schools programmes     The service managed this by introducing the Class TV strand to CBBC  which would air educational programming for approximately two hours each day in the late morning  with normal programming resuming in the early afternoon  Much of this programming was old BBC Schools programming shown  in some cases  decades before and which was for the most part still relevant  Very little new schools programmes were commissioned  Class TV ended in April       following a change to CBBC s remit  However  in December       CBBC brought back Class TV with  Live Lessons  presented by the CBBC presenting team on late weekday mornings   Presentation edit  See also  CBBC Presentation and BBC Children s idents CBBC has had a relatively similar presentation to that of its strand counterpart  The logo has consistently remained the same until      as the service  green coloured blobs at the beginning of its life and the green and white logo from September      until now  The logo today is all different colours unlike the last one  CBBC has mainly utilised presenters from the main service  with a few presenters appearing mostly on the new channel  Gemma Hunt and Anne Foy being notable examples and appearing consistently until August       At the beginning of September       along with the relaunch  the same presenters of CBBC would also feature on CBBC on BBC One and Two  When CBBC launched  presentation was located in TC  at BBC Television Centre  where the channel shared studio facilities with CBBC s original magazine show Xchange  This changed in Autumn       when CBBC moved to TC  following the normal CBBC links move to TC    however  this was changed in March      so that all CBBC and CBBC channel links were located in TC   A further change was to take place in December      when all output moved to a Chroma key set within TC    and was presented by only one presenter  This short live decision lasted until the relaunch in       which involved a new  office  set being constructed  initially in TC   and then in a new studio facility in the East Tower of Television Centre  In       CBBC moved to MediaCityUK  and has been presented from there since September       The Office has been through a number of revamps since then  two in       the first one being a minor change because of the Go CBBC app  and another one in May which entirely changed some of the structure  adding a post chute and an Up Next screen  and one so far in       due to CBBC s new look  gaining a smaller desk  an extra Up Next screen  and renaming it  CBBC HQ    Other services edit  CBBC Extra edit  As from       CBBC Extra is now also accessed by the CBBC website      CBBC Extra is a free interactive television service from CBBC provided by the BBC Red Button  It is accessible from CBBC by pressing red and then selecting CBBC Extra from the main menu  It can also be accessed from any other BBC channel by pressing red and going to page number      The service differs across digital platforms  for example Sky viewers can access a video loop  Its availability on Freeview is dependent upon BBC Red Button not showing other interactive services  such as major sports events coverage      The service offers numerous features including Newsround  Horoscopes  Chris Dodge s Blog  viewer content and jokes and other interactive elements   CBBC Online edit  Main article  BBC Online The CBBC website provides a wide range of activities for viewers aged       such as games  videos  puzzles  printable pages  pre moderated message boards and frequently updated news feeds  It contains pages for the majority of its current programming with various content on each  There are also micro sites from Newsround and MOTD Kickabout  providing children with news and sport  as well as the CBBC on BBC iPlayer to replay CBBC programmes for up to thirty days   CBBC HD edit  In July       BBC announced that CBBC HD would be launched by early           The channel launched on    December           CBBC HD broadcasts on the BBC s existing HD multiplex on Freeview and shares its stream with BBC Three HD as they air at different times  Prior to launch  the majority of CBBC HD output was broadcast on BBC HD before its closure in March       CBBC HD was added to the Sky EPG in Ireland in       From July to August       CBBC HD was temporarily removed from Freeview during the      Commonwealth Games to let BBC Three and BBC Three HD broadcast    hours a day  similar to how BBC Parliament was removed during the      Summer Olympics and      Summer Olympics  From March to April       CBBC HD used downtime mode to let BBC Red Button HD broadcast  pm to     am on Sky and Freeview  After the close  CBBC HD began to use    hours again   CBBC Alba edit  In September      as part of a branding strategy  the unbranded   hour children s block on BBC Alba was split into CBeebies Alba and CBBC Alba  with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour  This block features its own presentation  presenters and shows all dubbed into Scottish Gaelic  Previously  a similar block called Children s BBC Scotland was aired in the Scottish school holidays throughout the     s  The block consisted of repeats and local programming as well as regional versions of the summer holiday mid morning slot and the Children s BBC Breakfast Show       See also edit    BBC portal CBBC   BBC s children s television strand
