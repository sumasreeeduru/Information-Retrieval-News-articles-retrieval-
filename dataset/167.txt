in South Africa with an estimated       million people living mainly in the province of KwaZulu Natal  They originated from Nguni communities who took part in the Bantu migrations  As the clans integrated together  the rulership of Shaka brought success to the Zulu nation due to his perfected military policies  The Zulu people take pride in their ceremonies such as the Umhlanga  or Reed Dance  and their various forms of beadwork  The art and skill of beadwork takes part in the identification of Zulu people and acts as a form of communication  The men and women both serve different purposes in society in order to function as a whole  Today the Zulu people predominantly believe in Christianity  but have created a syncretic religion that is combined with the Zulu s prior belief

The Zulu were originally a major clan in what is today Northern KwaZulu Natal  founded ca       by Zulu kaMalandela  In the Nguni languages  iZulu means heaven  or weather  At that time  the area was occupied by many large Nguni communities and clans  also called the isizwe people or nation  or were called isibongo  referring to their clan or family name   Nguni communities had migrated down Africa s east coast over centuries  as part of the Bantu migrations  As the nation began to develop  the rulership of Shaka brought the clans together to build a cohesive identity for the Zulu

commander of the Mthethwa Empire and successor to Dingiswayo   united what was once a confederation of tribes into an imposing empire under Zulu hegemony  Shaka built a militarised system known as Impi featuring conscription  a standing army  new weaponry  regimentation  and encirclement battle tactics  Zulu expansion was a major factor of the Mfecane   Crushing   that depopulated large areas of southern Africa  It is during this period when Shaka deployed an army regiment for raiding tribes on the North  The regiment which was under Mzilikazi disobeyed Shaka and crafted a plan to continue raiding up North forming another dialect of Zulu language referred to as Northern Ndebele  Now in Zimbabwe    Conflict with the British edit  Main article  Anglo Zulu War In mid December       envoys of the British crown delivered an ultimatum to    chiefs representing the then current king of the Zulu empire  Cetshwayo   Under the British terms delivered to the Zulu  Cetshwayo would have been required to disband his army and accept British sovereignty  Cetshwayo refused  and war between the Zulus and African contingents of the British crown began on January           Despite an early victory for the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana on the   nd of January  the British fought back and won the Battle at Rorke s Drift  and decisively defeated the Zulu army by July at the Battle of Ulundi   Absorption into Natal edit   Zulu warriors in the late nineteenth century  with Europeans in the background  After Cetshwayo s capture a month following his defeat  the British divided the Zulu Empire into     kinglets   The sub kingdoms fought amongst each other until      when Cetshwayo was reinstated as king over Zululand  This still did not stop the fighting and the Zulu monarch was forced to flee his realm by Zibhebhu  one of the    kinglets  supported by Boer mercenaries  Cetshwayo died in February       killed by Zibhebhu s regime  leaving his son  the    year old Dinuzulu  to inherit the throne  In fighting between the Zulu continued for years  until in      Zululand was absorbed fully into the British colony of Natal   Apartheid years edit  KwaZulu homeland edit  Main article  KwaZulu  Zulu man performing traditional warrior dance Under apartheid  the homeland of KwaZulu  Kwa meaning place of  was created for Zulu people  In       the Bantu Homeland Citizenship Act provided that all Zulus would become citizens of KwaZulu  losing their South African citizenship  KwaZulu consisted of many disconnected pieces of land  in what is now KwaZulu Natal  Hundreds of thousands of Zulu people living on privately owned  black spots  outside of KwaZulu were dispossessed and forcibly moved to bantustans   worse land previously reserved for whites contiguous to existing areas of KwaZulu  By       approximately     million Zulu people lived in KwaZulu  and approximately   million lived in the rest of South Africa  The Chief Minister of KwaZulu  from its creation in       as Zululand  was Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi  In       KwaZulu was joined with the province of Natal  to form modern KwaZulu Natal   Inkatha YeSizwe edit  Main article  Inkatha Freedom Party Inkatha YeSizwe means  the crown of the nation   In       Buthelezi revived the Inkatha YaKwaZulu  predecessor of the Inkatha Freedom Party  This organization was nominally a protest movement against apartheid  but held more conservative views than the ANC  For example  Inkatha was opposed to the armed struggle  and to sanctions against South Africa  Inkatha was initially on good terms with the ANC  but the two organizations came into increasing conflict beginning in      in the aftermath of the Soweto Uprising   Language edit   Map of South Africa showing the primary Zulu language speech area in green Main article  Zulu language The language of the Zulu people is  isiZulu   a Bantu language  more specifically  part of the Nguni subgroup  Zulu is the most widely spoken language in South Africa  where it is an official language  More than half of the South African population are able to understand it  with over   million first language and over    million second language speakers     Many Zulu people also speak Xitsonga  Sesotho and others from among South Africa s    official languages   Ceremony edit   Zulu people gather at Reed Dance ceremony  See also  Zulu calendar Umhlanga edit  The Zulu people celebrate an annual event that was established in      called the Umhlanga or Reed Dance  This event takes place at the royal capital near Nongoma     This traditional ceremony is performed by young women from all parts of the kingdom to perform in front of the monarch and his guests     The purpose of this event is to promote pride in virginity and to restrain sexual relationships     Beadwork is a prominent attire that is worn at the Umhlanga  The beadwork is not only worn by the dancers  but by the guests as well  The Umhlanga is not purely for a time of dance  The King also uses this time to speak to the young men and women of the nation  The King discusses the arising political issues that are inflicting on their nation       Married Zulu women wearing headdresses at annual Reed Dance ceremony  Beadwork edit  History edit  The creation of beadwork dates back to the times of war for the Zulu people  This particular form of beadwork were known as iziqu  medallions of war     Often worn as a necklace  the beads were displayed in a criss cross formation across the shoulders  This assemblage of beads by the warriors represented a symbol of bravery     Before the use of glass was apparent to the Zulu  beadwork derived from wood  seeds and berries     It was not until the arrival of Europeans that glass became a trade material with the Portuguese  which soon became abundantly available to the Zulu      Purpose edit  Beadwork is a form of communication for the Zulu people  Typically when one is wearing multiple beads  it is a sign of wealth  The more beads one is wearing  the wealthier they are perceived     The beads have the potential to convey information about a person s age  gender and marital status  The design of the beads often conveys a particular message  However  one must know the context of their use in order to read the message correctly     Depending on the area in which the beadwork was made  some designs can depict different messages compared to other areas  A message could be embedded into the colors and structure of the beads or could be strictly for decorative purposes     Beadwork can be worn in everyday use  but is often worn during important occasions such as weddings  or ceremonies  For example  beadwork is featured during the coming of age for a young girl or worn during dances     The beaded elements complement the costumes worn by the Zulu people to bring out a sense of finery or prestige      Apparel edit   Zulu beadwork necklace Beadwork is worn by all men  women  and children at any age  Depending on which stage of life an individual is in  the beadwork indicates different meanings  Beadwork is dominantly worn when young Zulu people are courting or in search for love affairs      The wearing of decorative beadwork can act as an attempt to grab the attention of someone of the opposite sex      Also  the gifting of beadwork is a way of communicating interest with lovers      During the transition from single to married women  beadwork is shown through a beaded cloth apron worn over a pleated leather skirt     As for older or mature women  beadwork is displayed in detailed headdresses and cowhide skirts that extend past the knee  These long skirts are also seen on unmarried women and young marriageable age girls      Men are more conservative when wearing beadwork      Although  when young boys are seen wearing multiple necklaces  it is a sign that he is highly interested by these gifts from various girls  The more gifts he is wearing  the higher prestige he obtains       Zulu beadwork necklace  Colors of beads edit  Various forms of beadwork are found in different color schemes  Typically  there are four different types of color schemes   Isisshunka   white  light blue  dark green  pale yellow  pink  red  black  This color scheme is believed to have no specific meaning      Isithembu   light blue  grass green  bright yellow  red  black  This color scheme derives from clans or clan areas      Umzansi   white  dark blue  grass green  red  This color scheme also derives from clans or clan areas      Isinyolovane   combination of any colors not consistent with other color schemes  This color scheme is often related to connotations of perfection and charm      The colors of beads might hold different meanings based on the area that they originated from  It is often at times that this can lead to misrepresentation or confusion when attempting to understand what the beadwork is communicating  One cannot assume that the color system is standard across South Africa  In some areas  the color green symbolizes jealousy in a certain area  but in another area it symbolizes grass     One must know the origin of the beadwork in order to interpret the message correctly   Clothing edit  See also  Swenkas  Zulu village women in traditional clothing   Interior space of a traditional beehive hut  or iQhugwane Zulus wear a variety of attire  both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions  and modern westernized clothing for everyday use  The women dress differently depending on whether they are single  engaged  or married  The men wore a leather belt with two strips of hide hanging down front and back  In South Africa  the miniskirt has existed since pre colonial times  In the African cultures  such as the Basotho  the Batswana  the Bapedi  the Amaswati and the AmaZulu  women wore traditional miniskirts as cultural attire      These skirts are not seen as shameless but used to cover the women s genitals  The skirts are called isigcebhezana and are essential in Zulu ceremonies  For example  Umemulo is a ceremony for women who turn    years of age      It represents a huge transition in the woman s life because it is a symbol of her being ready to accept a boyfriend and even get married  Additionally  each stage of a Zulu s life is determined by a specific type of clothing  For an unmarried woman  she wears the skirt and nothing on the top  but as she grows up  the woman starts to cover up her body because a time will come in which she will be a married woman and an old woman  Nonetheless  a special type of clothing is reserved to pregnant women  When a woman is pregnant she wears an  isibamba   a thick belt made from dried grass  covered with glass or plastic beadwork  to support her swelling stomach and its additional weight       Societal roles edit  Men edit  The Zulu people govern under a patriarchal society     Men are perceived as the head of the household and seen as authoritative figures  Zulu men identify themselves with great pride and dignity  They also compare themselves to qualities of powerful wild animals such as  bulls  lions and elephants     The men contribute to society by acting as defenders  hunters  and lovers     The Zulu men are also in charge of herding the cattle  educating themselves on the lives of disciplined warriors  creating weapons  and learning the art of stick fighting      Stick fighting edit  The art of stick fighting is a celebration of manhood for Zulu men  These men can begin to learn this fighting art form as young as the age of five years old     There are multiple reasons why men learn how to stick fight  For example  men may want to learn so that they can set right any wrongs or insults made towards them     Other reasons some men choose to learn are for sporting purposes  proving skills or manliness  and self defense     The goal of stick fighting is to injure the opponent and sometimes even kill     There are rules of etiquette that must be abided by when stick fighting  The men can only fight a man within the same age as them  One cannot hit the opponent once the stick is lost from the possession  Lastly  only sticks are allowed when fighting      Women edit  The women in Zulu society often perform domestic chores such as cleaning  raising children  collect water and firewood  laundry  tend to crops  cooking  and making clothes     Women can be considered as the sole income earner of the household  A woman s stages of life lead up to the goal of marriage  As a woman approaches puberty  she is known as a tshitshi  A tshitshi reveals her singleness by wearing less clothing  Single women typically do not wear clothing to cover their head  breasts  legs and shoulders     Engaged women wear hairnets to show their marital status to society and married women cover themselves in clothing and headdresses     Also  women are taught to defer to men and treat them with great respect  The women are always bound by a male figure to abide by      Religion and beliefs edit  Main articles  Zulu traditional religion and Zulu Christianity  Zulu worshippers at a United African Apostolic Church  near Oribi Gorge Most Zulu people state their beliefs to be Christian  Some of the most common churches to which they belong are African Initiated Churches  especially the Zion Christian Church  Nazareth Baptist Church and United African Apostolic Church  although membership of major European Churches  such as the Dutch Reformed  Anglican and Catholic Churches are also common  Nevertheless  many Zulus retain their traditional pre Christian belief system of ancestor worship in parallel with their Christianity  Traditional Zulu religion includes belief in a creator God  uNkulunkulu  who is above interacting in day to day human life  although this belief appears to have originated from efforts by early Christian missionaries to frame the idea of the Christian God in Zulu terms      Traditionally  the more strongly held Zulu belief was in ancestor spirits  amaThongo or amaDlozi   who had the power to intervene in people s lives  for good or ill      This belief continues to be widespread among the modern Zulu population      Traditionally  the Zulu recognize several elements to be present in a human being  the physical body  inyama yomzimba or umzimba   the breath or life force  umoya womphefumulo or umoya   and the  shadow   prestige  or personality  isithunzi   Once the umoya leaves the body  the isithunzi may live on as an ancestral spirit  idlozi  only if certain conditions were met in life           Behaving with ubuntu  or showing respect and generosity towards others  enhances one s moral standing or prestige in the community  one s isithunzi       By contrast  acting in a negative way towards others can reduce the isithunzi  and it is possible for the isithunzi to fade away completely        Zulu sangomas  diviners  In order to appeal to the spirit world  a diviner  sangoma  must invoke the ancestors through divination processes to determine the problem  Then  a herbalist  inyanga  prepares a mixture  muthi  to be consumed in order to influence the ancestors  As such  diviners and herbalists play an important part in the daily lives of the Zulu people  However  a distinction is made between white muthi  umuthi omhlope   which has positive effects  such as healing or the prevention or reversal of misfortune  and black muthi  umuthi omnyama   which can bring illness or death to others  or ill gotten wealth to the user      Users of black muthi are considered witches  and shunned by the society  Christianity had difficulty gaining a foothold among the Zulu people  and when it did it was in a syncretic fashion  Isaiah Shembe  considered the Zulu Messiah  presented a form of Christianity  the Nazareth Baptist Church  which incorporated traditional customs      Furthermore  Zulu people also practice a ceremony called Ukweshwama  The killing of the bull is part of Ukweshwama  an annual ceremony that celebrates a new harvest  It is a day of prayer when Zulus thank their creator and their ancestors  By tradition  a new regiment of young warriors is asked to confront a bull to prove its courage  inheriting the beast s strength as it expires  It is believed this power then transfers to the Zulu king       Bride wealth edit  Zulu people have a system called ilobolo  This term is particularly used by Zulu people when it comes to bride wealth  Every African ethnic group has different requirements when it comes to bride wealth  In pre capitalist Zulu society  ilobolo was inextricably linked to the ownership of cattle      During that time  there was not a fixed amount of cattle required for the wedding to happen  It could be paid before the marriage or during the marriage  The groom will be taking the cattle from his father s herd in order to perpetuate the family heritage  Nonetheless  this ritual has changed during colonization because in       Theophilus Shepstone  then Natal Secretary for Native Affairs  formalized the ilobolo payment to    cattle for commoners  plus the ingquthu cow for the mother      for hereditary chief siblings and    plus for the daughters of a chief      They found it too lenient to let the groom give whichever amount he wants so they decided to instore specific amount of cattle that will be needed this time before or at the start of the marriage  This decision that had been taken by Zulu men who were educated in mission schools but according to the other people  this ritual became  untraditional   Additionally  with the instauration of the Natal Code  some Zulu men decided to settle another way in which they could decrease the ilobo  offer a token payment or bring a present for the father of the prospective bride in order to decrease the ilobolo amount to be paid      The payment of ilobolo can be sometimes difficult for some families but it is a symbol of pride and respect  Consequently  this is the reason why some are willing to maintain it as long as possible  Traditional Zulu dance Notable Zulus edit  Main article  List of Zulu people In
