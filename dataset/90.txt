letters and other symbols  called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems  are retrieved and ordered according to a language s orthography for visual display  Typesetting requires one or more fonts  which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for typefaces   One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily

article  Movable type During much of the letterpress era  movable type was composed by hand for each page  Cast metal sorts were composed into words  then lines  then paragraphs  then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form  with all letter faces exactly the same  height to paper   creating an even surface of type  The form was placed in a press  inked  and an impression made on paper     During typesetting  individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand  and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right  and as viewed by the setter upside down  As seen in the photo of the composing stick  a lower case  q  looks like a  d   a lower case  b  looks like a  p   a lower case  p  looks like a  b  and a lower case  d  looks like a  q   This is reputed to be the origin of the expression  mind your p s and q s   It might just as easily have been  mind your b s and d s      The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort  a face  b body or shank  c point size    shoulder    nick    groove    foot  Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type  Not shown  and more the concern of the casterman  is the  set   or width of each sort  Set width  like body size  is measured in points  In order to extend the working life of type  and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type  copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text  freeing the costly type for other work  This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press  In this process  called stereotyping  the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier m ch  called a flong to create a positive  from which the stereotype form was electrotyped  cast of type metal  Advances such as the typewriter and computer would push the state of the art even farther ahead  Still  hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use  and since the introduction of digital typesetting  it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit  However  it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market   Hot metal typesetting edit  Main article  Hot metal typesetting The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the   th century to produce mechanical typesetting  While some  such as the Paige compositor  met with limited success  by the end of the   th century  several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text  Most of the successful systems involved the in house casting of the type to be used  hence are termed  hot metal  typesetting  The Linotype machine  invented in       used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices  and cast an entire line of type at a time  hence its name   In the Monotype System  a keyboard was used to punch a paper tape  which was then fed to control a casting machine  The Ludlow Typograph involved hand set matrices  but otherwise used hot metal  By the early   th century  the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses   Phototypesetting edit  Main article  Phototypesetting  Linotype CRTronic     phototypesetting terminal Phototypesetting or  cold type  systems first appeared in the early     s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines  These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips  one per font  that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light sensitive paper  Originally they were driven by pre punched paper tapes  Later they were connected to computer front ends  One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor  The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display  To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time  If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text  With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film  Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film  resulting in a column of black type on white paper  or a galley   The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page   A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make plates for offset printing   Digital era edit  Play media Dutch newsreel from      about the transition to computer typesetting The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube  Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS             IBM              I I I  VideoComp          Autologic APS             and Linotron                These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the     s and     s  Such machines could be  driven online  by a computer front end system or took their data from magnetic tape  Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives  Computers excel at automatically typesetting and correcting documents     Character by character  computer aided phototypesetting was  in turn  rapidly rendered obsolete in the     s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high resolution digital image  now known as imagesetting  The first commercially successful laser imagesetter  able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp  ECRM  Compugraphic  later purchased by Agfa  and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own  Early minicomputer based typesetting software introduced in the     s and early     s  such as Datalogics Pager  Penta  Atex  Miles     Xyvision  troff from Bell Labs  and IBM s Script product with CRT terminals  were better able to drive these electromechanical devices  and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information  The descendants of these text markup languages include SGML  XML and HTML  The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of          or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the Israeli made Scitex Dolev  The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters  often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device  drove development of generalized printer control languages  such as Adobe Systems  PostScript and Hewlett Packard s PCL    Text sample  an extract of the essay The Renaissance of English Art by Oscar Wilde  typeset in Iowan Old Style roman  italics and small caps  adjusted to approximately    words per line  with the typeface sized at    points on     x leading  with     points extra tracking  Computerized typesetting was so rare that BYTE magazine  comparing itself to  the proverbial shoemaker s children who went barefoot   did not use any computers in production until its August      issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout  The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks  but hoped to do so  as matters progress      Before the     s  practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies  These companies performed keyboarding  editing and production of paper or film output  and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry  In the United States  these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania  New England or the Midwest  where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby  but still within a few hours  travel time of the major publishing centers  In       with the new concept of WYSIWYG  for What You See Is What You Get  in text editing and word processing on personal computers  desktop publishing became available  starting with the Apple Macintosh  Aldus PageMaker  and later QuarkXPress  and PostScript and on the PC platform with Xerox Ventura Publisher under DOS as well as Pagemaker under Windows  Improvements in software and hardware  and rapidly lowering costs  popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems  At the same time  word processing systems  such as Wang and WordPerfect and Microsoft Word  revolutionized office documents  They did not  however  have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout  graphics  mathematics  or advanced hyphenation and justification rules  H and J   By the year       this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in house computers  Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists  The availability of cheap or free fonts made the conversion to do it yourself easier  but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs  The advent of PostScript  supplemented by the PDF file format  provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts  readable on major computers and operating systems   SCRIPT variants edit  Main article  SCRIPT  markup   Mural mosaic  Typesetter  at John A  Prior Health Sciences Library in Ohio IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word  SCRIPT   Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features  such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index  multicolumn page layout  footnotes  boxes  automatic hyphenation and spelling verification      NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP    CMS SCRIPT      Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo later      One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA CS at UW took over project development in       The program was first used at UW in       In the     s  SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer  By the late     s  the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades      The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May      issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter  which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT   It easily handles footnotes Page numbers can be in Arabic or Roman numerals  and can appear at the top or bottom of the page  in the centre  on the left or on the right  or on the left for even numbered pages and on the right for odd numbered pages Underscoring or overstriking can be made a function of SCRIPT  thus uncomplicating editor functions SCRIPT files are regular OS datasets or CMS files Output can be obtained on the printer  or at the terminal  The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over     commands to assist in formatting documents  though   to    of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs   Thus  SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors      SCRIPT VS was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the     s  DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS DOS  called after its author  D  D  Williams      but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM  Script is still available from IBM as part of the Document Composition Facility for the z OS operating system       SGML and XML systems edit  The standard generalized markup language  SGML  was based upon IBM Generalized Markup Language  GML   GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script  DSSSL is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents  XML is a successor of SGML  XSL FO is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files  The arrival of SGML XML as the document model made other typesetting engines popular  Such engines include Datalogics Pager  Penta  Miles    s OASYS  Xyvision s XML Professional Publisher  XPP   FrameMaker  Arbortext  XSL FO compatible engines include Apache FOP  Antenna House Formatter  RenderX s XEP  These products allow users to program their SGML XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages  YesLogic s Prince is another one  which is based on CSS Paged Media   Troff and successors edit  Main article  Troff During the mid     s  Joe Ossanna  working at Bell Laboratories  wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C A T phototypesetter owned by the Labs  it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment  such as laser printers  While its use has fallen off  it is still included with a number of Unix and Unix like systems  and has been used to typeset a number of high profile technical and computer books  Some versions  as well as a GNU work alike called groff  are now open source   TeX and LaTeX edit   Mathematical text typeset using TeX and the AMS Euler font  Main article  TeX The TeX system  developed by Donald E  Knuth at the end of the     s  is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards  especially for typesetting mathematics  LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX are variants of TeX and of LaTeX scriptable in Lua   TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own  and deals more with appearance than structure  The LaTeX macro package written by Leslie Lamport at the beginning of the     s offered a simpler interface  and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document  LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books  Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort  there are programs that do  These programs include Scientific Workplace and LyX  which are graphical interactive editors  TeXmacs  while being an independent typesetting system  can also be used as an aid for the preparation of TeX documents through its export capability   Other text formatters edit  GNU TeXmacs  whose name is a combination of TeX and Emacs  although it is independent from both of these programs  is a typesetting system which is at the same time a WYSIWYG word processor  Several other text formatting software exist  but are not widely used  Notably Lout  Patoline  Sile  Pollen  Ant  See also edit  Composing stick Dingbat Font History of Western typography Ligature  typography
