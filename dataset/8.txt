Television Service  and was the world s first regular television service with a high level of image resolution     It was renamed BBC TV in       using this name until the launch of the second BBC channel BBC  in       whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC   with the current spelling adopted of BBC One in       The channel s annual budget for           was       billion     The

channel Main article  BBC Television The BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House  London  on    August       The BBC Television Service officially began regular broadcasts on   November      from a converted wing of the Alexandra Palace in London     On   September       two days before Britain declared war on Germany  the station was taken off air with little warning  with one of the last programmes to be shown before the suspension of the service being a Mickey Mouse cartoon  the      short Mickey s Gala Premier      the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on London  BBC Television returned on   June      at        Jasmine Bligh  one of the original announcers  made the first announcement  saying   Good afternoon everybody  How are you  Do you remember me  Jasmine Bligh    The same Mickey Mouse cartoon that was shown in      was repeated twenty minutes later      Creation of BBC  edit  The BBC held a statutory monopoly on television broadcasting in the United Kingdom until the first Independent Television station began to broadcast on    September       when ITV started broadcasting  The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities following a large reduction in its audience  The      Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting noticed this  and that ITV lacked any serious programming  It therefore decided that Britain s third television station should be awarded to the BBC     The station  renamed BBC TV in       became BBC  when BBC  was launched on    April      transmitting an incompatible     line image on UHF  The only way to receive all channels was to use a complex  dual standard       and     line  VHF and UHF  receiver  with both a VHF and a UHF aerial  Old     line only sets became obsolete in       when transmission in the standard ended  although standards converters have become available for enthusiasts who collect and restore such TVs  BBC  was based at the purpose built BBC Television Centre at White City  London between      and       Television News continued to use Alexandra Palace as its base by early      it had even converted one of its studios to colour before moving to new purpose built facilities at Television Centre on    September       In the weeks leading up to    November       BBC  unofficially transmitted the occasional programme in its new colour system  to test it  At midnight on    November  simultaneously with ITV and two years after BBC   BBC  officially began     line PAL colour programming on UHF with a broadcast of a concert by Petula Clark     Colour transmissions could be received  in monochrome  on monochrome     line sets until the end of analogue broadcasting  and indeed can still be received if such a set is connected to a digital television adapter tuned to the SDTV version of the channel   In terms of audience share  the most successful period for BBC  was under Bryan Cowgill between      and       when the channel achieved an average audience share of         This period is still regarded by many as a golden age of the BBC s output  with the BBC achieving a very high standard across its entire range of series  serials  plays  light entertainment and documentaries  original research   On    December       the BBC announced their intention to introduce a new breakfast television service to compete with TV am  The BBC stated it would start broadcasting before TV am  but made clear their hands were tied until November      when the new licence fee income became available  to help finance extending broadcast hours  with the hope of starting in        On    January       the first edition of Breakfast Time was shown on BBC   becoming the first UK wide breakfast television service     and continued to lead in the ratings until                Michael Grade era             edit  In       Bill Cotton become managing director of Television at the BBC  and set about overhauling BBC   which had been slated for poor home grown shows  its heavy reliance on US imports  with Dallas and The Thorn Birds being BBC  s highest rated programmes and ratings being over     behind ITV  Cotton recruited Michael Grade to become Controller of BBC  from   September              the first time the Corporation had recruited someone outside of the BBC      replacing Alan Hart  who has been criticised for his lack of knowledge in general entertainment  as he was head of BBC Sport prior to       The first major overhaul was to axe the unpopular Sixty Minutes current affairs programme  this was a replacement for the news and magazine show Nationwide  Its replacement was the BBC Six O Clock News          a straight new programme in a bid to shore up its failing early evening slot  It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the       slot  but this was dismissed  The Miss Great Britain contest was dropped  being described as verging on the too offensive after the January      contest  with Worlds Strongest Man and International Superstar also being cancelled      BBC  was relaunched on    February      with a new look  new programming including Wogan  EastEnders and a revised schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers throughout the course of the evening  Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour  while Panorama and Omnibus were both moved after the Nine O Clock News      Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC  scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes  Grade stated  When I took over BBC   I discovered there were wonderful things  it was just a case of where to put them   Wogan had been scheduled for a    pm slot  but Grade moved it to a   pm slot as he believed the show had potential      From February to August       a high number of American mini series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes  including  Allo  Allo   In Sickness and in Health  and Open All Hours  Further improvement came about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing     million  with eight new series  including Howards  Way  All Creatures Great and Small  Hold the Back Page  and Bluebill  along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal  The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three year period  after BBC  was criticised for failing in matching ITV s output in drama      EastEnders was moved to a       slot  where it managed to soar to    million  helping the BBC  audience share increase to nearly     for the first time since       On    February       Doctor Who was placed on an    month hiatus  The BBC originally planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel  but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September       At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision  Grade was the target of death threats      but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration  making it impossible to find anyone  at the time  who knew what to do with the series          On   September       the long standing children s programming block was overhauled and rebranded as Children s BBC  which gave it dedicated idents for the first time and had a live in vision presenter  similar to rival ITV s Children s ITV block which had been running since January       Previously the BBC had broadcast children s programming using BBC  s team of regular duty announcers  The launch presenter for this block  and thus the first Children s BBC presenter of the current format  was Phillip Schofield  On    May       long running lunchtime magazine show Pebble Mill at One was broadcast for the last time after    years on the air  On    October       BBC  launched its daytime television schedules      In a statement  BBC Daytime head Roger Laughton said   It was the natural extension of the corporation s commitment to public service broadcasting  since half the population had access to television during the day mainly the retired  unemployed and housewives      s edit   Logo of BBC  from    February      to   October      Stereo audio transmissions  using the NICAM digital stereo sound format began on BBC  in late       to coincide with the sale of the first consumer NICAM enabled equipment  a year after BBC   and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output  although it took until    August      for the service to begin officially on both channels  During this time  both commercial analogue broadcasters  ITV and Channel   had officially begun stereo transmissions using the BBC developed NICAM system  Widescreen programming was introduced on digital platforms in       For the first fifty years of its existence  with the exception of films and purchased programmes from the United States and elsewhere  almost all the channel s output was produced by the BBC s in house production departments  This changed following the passing of the Broadcasting Act       which required that     of the BBC s television output be out sourced to independent production companies      By      many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents  but the in house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule  In March       as part of the     million programme package for spring and summer line up on BBC   it was announced an extra     million was to be spent on rejuvenating the channels drama and comedy output during peak times  which meant the channel would be in a healthy state once the new Channel   licences were awarded      In December      Wogan was to be cancelled  due to falling ratings against a number of ITV shows  in which Wogan only managed six million viewers compared to double for This Is Your Life  The Krypton Factor and The         Question  Additionally an extra     million a year was spent on narrowing the gap on ITV s ratings lead  since a few months prior to this the channel had been criticised for its Autumn schedule  having tired formats  uninspiring scheduling of new programmes and poor scripts      Wogan was replaced with Eldorado  in early July       but this was itself cancelled a year later  Alan Yentob launched the      Autumn schedule calling it  My first try with a lot of help from my friends   with the channel still under criticism  following the start of new programming Alan introduced a year earlier and the number of summer repeats       million was spent on    hours of original drama produced  enchantment to the arts with an extended    week run for Omnibus  and documentaries with The Downing Street Years  new wildlife series and an eight month look at Sheffield s Children s hospital  while Goodnight Sweetheart  Grace   Favour and The Danny Baker Show were new comedy series      Lois   Clark  The New Adventures of Superman was brought in to give the Saturday night line up a bit of variety  Following the public disapproval of filling its schedule with     of repeats during the summer months in       BBC  agreed to broadcast an extra     hours worth of original programming over the same period during the summer in       which included giving EastEnders an additional episode per week  Efficiency savings of     million were found which were redeployed on the new productions  The savings were seen as a vindication so for the producer choice  the controversial market oriented drive introduced in April               By March       the channel admitted defeat in its ratings war with ITV  with its Spring line up with a stronger emphasis on serious factual programmes  educations and drama  This change in strategy came about after continuing complaints that the channel was appealing to the lowest common denominator to win viewers  which has left it chastened by the hoax guests on The Vanessa Show  over reliance on docusoaps and the dropping of the vilified Noel s House Party  Alan Yentob said  The spring package is to remind people of what the BBC is here for  Range and ambition you won t find anywhere else at peak time   The changes help the channel distinguish itself from  as one BBC executive said   its downmarket rival and would not compete for viewers on ITV s terms            s edit  Lorraine Heggessey became Controller of BBC One  a post she took up on   November               She had previously been sounded out about the job in      after Michael Jackson s departure  but had turned down the opportunity as she felt she was then not yet experienced enough      During Heggessey s five years in charge  BBC One s audience share fell by        to      although this was in the context of declining audience figures across all British television channels due to increased competition from multichannel digital television      However  in      BBC One overtook its main rival ITV in terms of annual audience share for the first time since the rival channel had launched in           although much of this was down to the success of the channel s daytime television line up  which had its own Controller  Jane Lush      When Heggessey arrived at the channel in November       she inherited two controversial schedule changes which had been implemented the previous month  at the behest of Director General of the BBC Greg Dyke  the Nine O Clock News had been moved to the later time of       and Panorama moved from a Monday night prime time slot to a later slot on Sunday nights      The moving of Panorama attracted criticism that BBC One was sidelining serious programming in favour of more populist output      Heggessey publicly defended the decision  despite it not being hers  claiming that Panorama s ratings would have  dwindled  in its previous slot      Heggessey and the BBC s Controller of Drama Commissioning  Jane Tranter  took advantage of the weekday       slot opened up by the moving of the news to commission new popular drama output  such as the successful Waking the Dead             and Spooks                  Celebrity dancing show Strictly Come Dancing       present  was also a popular success on Saturday nights      although another Saturday night entertainment series  Fame Academy  faced accusations of being too derivative of the output of commercial rivals  and during Heggessey s era the channel frequently came under attack for being too populist and not providing enough serious programming      Immediately after her arrival  Heggessey ordered a review of the  Balloon  idents the channel had been using for its between programe idents since       In her opinion  the balloon was  slow and distant  and so  on    March       after much speculation  she took the decision to abandon the  Balloon  idents  and the traditional  Globe  idents the channel had used in a variety of forms since        They were replaced by a new style of on air identity for the channel  the  Rhythm   Movement  idents  The new idents attracted criticism for going against the traditions of the channel     and pandering to  political correctness   as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities      The abandonment of a station clock  and perceived lack of a  serious ident   also put the BBC in an embarrassing situation just one day into the new look with the death of the Queen Mother  One of Heggessey s most notable decisions and last major success at the channel was the recommissioning of the science fiction drama series Doctor Who  which had been a popular hit in previous decades but ceased production in       Heggessey and Jane Tranter recommissioned the series in September       after Heggessey had spent two years persuading the BBC s commercial arm  BBC Worldwide  to abandon their attempts to make a feature film version of the programme and allow it instead to return to BBC One      The new version of Doctor Who       present  debuted on    March      and became a critical and popular hit      with Paul Hoggart of The Times newspaper describing the series as  a joyful  exuberant reinvention and a fine legacy from Ms Heggessey       Heggessey did later concede in a      interview with The Independent newspaper that arts programming had suffered a cutback under her control of BBC One      However  she did respond to this omission following criticism from the Board of Governors of the BBC by commissioning programmes such as the arts documentary series Imagine          present  and A Picture of Britain             On    February      it was announced that Lorraine Heggessey was to leave the BBC to take up the post of Chief Executive at production company Talkback Thames      She left on    April  Five months after her departure  BBC One was named  Channel of the Year  at the Edinburgh Television Festival  primarily on the strength of Heggessey commissions such as Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who      Joining the channel as Controller in       Peter Fincham oversaw the commissioning of several successful BBC One programmes including Robin Hood              Jane Eyre        and How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria   which was followed by similar shows Any Dream Will Do and I d Do Anything because of its success      His first full year in charge of the channel saw a year on year growth in the audience share  with a rise from       in August      to       in August           Fincham also directly initiated the creation of both  The One Show       present   an early evening  current affairs and lifestyle magazine programme  which now runs all but two weeks of the year  and Davina         a prime time chat show  the latter hosted by Davina McCall  who presented Big Brother      However  Davina was a critical and ratings disaster      which Fincham subsequently admitted was personally his fault  although he defended the strategy of experimenting with the BBC One schedule  This he continued in January       when he moved the current affairs series Panorama from its Sunday night slot back to the prime time Monday evening slot from which it had been removed in       most likely in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel to show more current affairs programming in prime time        Logo of BBC One from    March      to   October      Fincham s judgement was again called into question  this time by The Telegraph  for his decision to spend      million replacing the channel s  Rhythm and Movement  idents  which had been introduced by his predecessor Lorraine Heggessey several years earlier  with the  Circle  idents  a set of eight ten second films  some of which were shot abroad in locations such as Mexico and Croatia      Fincham later found himself having to publicly defend the     million salary that the BBC paid Jonathan Ross in       although Ross s BBC One work primarily consisting of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross formed only part of his overall BBC commitment      The channel was named Channel of the Year at the      Broadcast Awards       The One to Watch campaign edit  Following its rebrand in March       BBC One launched The One to Watch campaign  during which animated blocks created the word  The  and moved into the BBC logo  Each new campaign incorporating the theme retained the same animated sequence  In May       Fincham took the decision to drop Neighbours  an Australian soap opera  from BBC One after    years on the channel  when its producers significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC to pay for it in a bidding war      Fincham commented that it was  a big loss   but that BBC One would not pay  the best part of      million   Neighbours left the channel in spring      to move to Channel        The Weakest Link was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap  with the afternoon CBBC slot moving    minutes earlier  There was further controversy in July      when Fincham was accused of misleading BBC One viewers  The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary A Year with the Queen which was shown to journalists during a press conference  It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear  but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order  meaning that a false impression was given      Fincham admitted the error  but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result      His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons  Chairman of the BBC Trust and he resigned on   October           In       a report published by the BBC Trust found said scheduling changes had led to a decrease in viewers      This was especially noticeable for Blue Peter and Newsround  two of CBBC s flagship programmes  Blue Peter which recorded its lowest viewing numbers since it started in       and Newsround with fewer than         viewers compared to

 As part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October      and approved by the BBC Trust in May       all children s programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover      It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only    of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only  it was made clear  Children s programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere       Children s programming on BBC One ended on    December           The move was criticised by Teletubbies co creator Anne Wood  who described the changes as  ghettoising children s programmes  and believe it was merely a cost cutting measure  Wood said  On the one hand it is inevitable  But it is dismissive of children  There is a certain amount of overlooking of the fact that children s programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of     I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do  A lot of the reason older people like to watch children s programming is because it is life enhancing   Head of BBC Children s  Joe Godwin said   Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children s programmes  Far from being a  cynical  move  we re just following where our audience has already gone       As part of the review in      other changes were brought in  including   BBC One is reducing the minimum hours of arts and music from    to     achieved through cutting episodes

 The Voice UK achieved good ratings for the BBC but ratings dropped towards the end of the first series and the second series  In       The Voice UK was rescheduled to avoid a clash  and as a result  ratings have improved  In November       it was announced that The Voice UK would be moving to ITV from        Sister channels edit  BBC One    edit  On   October       the BBC announced plans to launch a one hour timeshift of the channel  named BBC One         The channel would have replaced BBC Three in       However  on    June       the BBC Trust rejected the plans for a BBC One    channel

Dancing and The Apprentice  EastEnders was also made available in HD from Christmas Day       All programmes still made in standard definition were upscaled on the channel  with the intention that by      the vast majority of the channel s output would be in high definition  On    May      citation needed   the satellite and terrestrial resolution was increased to full HD  BBC One HD at launch did not offer regional variations  and therefore the channel could not broadcast during regional programming slots  most noticeably the local news programmes  The BBC Trust admitted that this was due to technical and financial constraints      but the BBC announced on   June      that the national variations of BBC One Northern Ireland  BBC One Scotland and BBC One Wales  would become available from               On    October       Northern Ireland received the first variation  A Scottish variation launched on    January       followed by a Welsh variation on    January           Unlike BBC One

otherwise identical to that of BBC One HD  On    July       the BBC indicated that it also wants to launch regional variants of BBC One HD across England  however this would require the approval of the BBC Trust  with a proposal due to be presented within six months      On    November       the Northern Irish regional variant of BBC One HD was swapped with the SD channel on Sky s EPG for HD

Main article  History of BBC television idents  The BBC One  Hippos  ident           BBC One s identity has been symbolised by a globe shown on its idents for much of its existence      The first BBC ident was shown on   December       known as the Bat s Wings  In      this was replaced by a map of the UK shown between programmes  and in      the globe appeared  changing in style and appearance over the next    years  Most notably  on    February       the  Computer Originated World  was introduced  This was a computer animated globe with the land coloured gold and the sea a transparent blue  giving the impression of a glass globe  This was replaced by the  Virtual Globe  on    February       On   October       the globe became a red  orange and yellow hot air balloon  coloured to resemble a globe  It was filmed flying around various places in the UK    The BBC One  Exercise Class  ident             On    March       the globe was replaced by a series of visual identities   idents   consisting of people dancing in various styles  These were replaced on   October      by the  circle  idents  According to the BBC  the circle symbol both represents togetherness  unity  and acts as a link to the classic globe icon used for    years      They ran until   December       when that year s Christmas idents launched  On   January       a new ident set launched  based on the theme of  oneness            Following complaints from viewers on social media that the      set of BBC One idents were not good examples of social distancing amid the COVID    pandemic in the UK  BBC One temporarily suspended the      idents on   May      in favour of a special set of idents that adhere towards the social distancing guidelines        Regional variations edit  BBC One has individual continuity and opt outs for Scotland       Wales      and Northern Ireland       Each variant maintains the BBC One logo with the addition of the constituent country name beneath it  In England       each region has an individual regional news and current affairs programme opt out as well as a limited amount of continuity  During these opt outs  the region name is displayed as with the national variations  beneath the main channel logo  according to whom   UK Today  a news programme  was shown nationally to digital viewers in place of regional programmes when they were unavailable to broadcast on analogue television  The programme was discontinued in      and replaced by a transmission of BBC London News until all BBC regions were made available digitally  BBC One Scotland has the greatest level of variation from the generic network  owing to BBC Scotland scheduling Scottish programming on the main BBC Scotland channel  rather than on BBC Two  BBC One Scotland variations include the soap opera River City and the football programme Sportscene  the inclusion of which causes network programming to be displaced or replaced  BBC One Wales was considered a separate channel by the BBC as early as its launch in the mid     s  appearing as BBC Wales        Availability outside the UK edit  BBC One  Northern Ireland  is widely available in the Republic of Ireland on cable and satellite television  BBC One is also available on cable and IPTV in the Netherlands  Belgium  Switzerland  Monaco and Liechtenstein  On    March      it was offered by British
