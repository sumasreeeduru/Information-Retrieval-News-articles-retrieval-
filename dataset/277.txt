in June       The new body  which would replace several existing authorities  was conceived as a  super regulator  to oversee media channels that were rapidly converging through digital transmission     Ofcom launched on    December       formally inheriting the duties that had previously been the responsibility of five different regulators      the Broadcasting Standards Commission the Independent Television Commission the Office of Telecommunications  Oftel  the Radio Authority the Radiocommunications Agency In July       Conservative party opposition leader David Cameron said in a speech against the proliferation of quangos that With a Conservative government  Ofcom as we know it will cease to exist  Its remit will be restricted to its narrow technical and enforcement roles  It will no longer play a role in making policy  And the policy making functions it has today will be transferred back fully to the Department for Culture  Media and Sport        Under Cameron s subsequent premiership of the      UK coalition government  the Public Bodies Act      did remove or modify several of Ofcom s duties  although it did not substantially reduce Ofcom s remit     On   October       Ofcom took over responsibility for regulating the postal services industry from the Postal Services Commission  Postcomm   In April       Ofcom announced that telephone companies would have to provide customers with a set charge for the cost of calling numbers starting          and     The streamlining of these charges must be printed in each customer s contract and monthly bills  The change came into force on   July      and affected over     million phone numbers  making it the biggest overhaul of telephoning in over a decade     On   January       the regulation of video on demand was transferred to Ofcom from ATVOD  the Authority for Television on Demand      The Digital Economy Act      extended Ofcom s remit and powers  Ofcom were given powers concerning the minimum broadband speed provided by Internet service providers  the ability to financially penalise communications providers for failing to comply with licence commitments and the power to require public service broadcasters to include a minimum quantity of children s programming made in the United Kingdom  The act also transferred to Ofcom the regulation of the BBC  a duty previously undertaken by the BBC Trust          and updated the Ofcom Electronic Communications Code to make it easier for telecommunications companies to erect and extend mobile masts      Following a consultation over the Online Harms White Paper published by the UK government in April       the government announced in February      that it intended Ofcom to have a greater role in Internet regulation to protect users from  harmful and illegal content       News International phone hacking scandal  Main article  News International phone hacking scandal In July       in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal  Ofcom came under pressure to launch an inquiry into whether the parent company of News International  News Corporation  was still the  fit and proper  owner of a controlling stake in the satellite broadcasting company British Sky Broadcasting  BSkyB   On    July former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged Ofcom to launch an investigation          On    July the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg stated that the Government would launch a review of laws on what constituted a  fit and proper  owner for broadcasting companies in the United Kingdom  and that anyone found not to meet that standard can be forced to give up their current holdings in a company      On    July       it was reported that Ofcom had begun an investigation into whether the phone hacking scandal may have changed BSkyB s status as the  fit and proper  holder of a UK broadcasting licence      On the same day Ed Richards  the then chief executive of Ofcom  replied to Simon Hughes MP  Don Foster MP and Tim Farron MP following a letter which they had written to him on   July concerning News Corporation s shareholding in BSkyB      In the letter Richards confirmed that Ofcom considers that News Corporation s current shareholding of        in BSkyB does give it a material influence over the company  that Ofcom is not precluded from acting by ongoing police investigations  and that Ofcom s process is not dependent upon a criminal conviction being secured      In April       Ofcom s probe moved from a monitoring phase to an  evidence gathering  phase       Timeline of communications regulators       present  edit     Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications      Activities edit  Television and radio edit  Ofcom licenses all UK commercial television and radio services in the UK  Broadcasters must comply by the terms of their licence  or risk having it revoked  Ofcom also publishes the Broadcasting Code  a series of rules which all broadcast content on television and radio must follow      The Broadcasting Code requires that content inappropriate for children should not be broadcast between the hours of      a m  and      p m  Premium rate film services may broadcast content equivalent to a BBFC    certificate at any time of day provided a PIN protected system is in place to restrict access to those authorised to view it      The broadcasting of pornography with a BBFC R   certificate is not permitted      In      Ofcom revoked the licences of four free to air television channels for promoting adult chat services during daytime hours and transmitting content that was too sexually explicit  The companies involved were fined               Ofcom s jurisdiction does not cover television and radio channels which are broadcast in the UK but licensed abroad  In      Ofcom lodged a complaint with the Dutch media regulator regarding the content of adult chat television channels which are broadcast in the UK but licensed in the Netherlands      Based on a survey of     British respondents  Ofcom published in      a list of about    words classified in four grades of offensiveness  from  milder  to  strongest        Telephone and broadband edit  Ofcom regulates the UK telecoms sector  defining and enforcing the conditions by which all mobile and fixed line phone and broadband companies must abide  These  general conditions  are wide ranging rules relating to matters such as telephone numbering  emergency services  sales  marketing and interconnection standards  Ofcom s investigation unit monitors compliance with the conditions and resolves disputes between providers  Ofcom is also the competition authority for telecoms  enforcing remedies in markets where it believes dominant operators may have a potentially harmful influence on competition or consumers  One of its most high profile interventions was to require BT to split its wholesale and retail arms into separate companies  bringing about the creation of Openreach which supplies wholesale services to both BT Retail and competing providers      On   July       Ofcom made a number of changes to the way phone calls to UK service numbers would be charged  Under the new legislation  which was promoted by an information campaign entitled UK Calling      call charges must be clearly stated on all materials that advertise a service number  The changes came after research found that callers are often confused about service call charges  and thus can avoid calling these numbers  The July      changes also saw  freephone numbers       and      become free to call from both mobiles and landlines      In March       Ofcom launched an interactive  Mobile coverage and fixed broadband checker       allowing people to check mobile coverage and broadband speeds via their post code   Spectrum licensing and protection edit  Ofcom is responsible for the management  regulation  assignment and licensing of the electromagnetic spectrum in the UK  and licenses portions of it for use in television and radio broadcasts  mobile phone transmissions  private communications networks  wireless devices and so on   The process of licensing varies depending on the type of use required   Some licences simply have to be applied and paid for  other commercial licences are subject to a bidding process   Most of the procedures in place have been inherited from the systems used by the previous regulators  However  Ofcom may change some of these processes in future  Ofcom protects the radio spectrum in a number of ways   Working within international organisations  ITU  CEPT and BEREC   Licensing UK controlled commercial radio spectrum  the Ministry of Defence controls its own spectrum   Within the international framework for frequency use  Ofcom liaises through the UK Government to produce the UKFAT  UK Frequency Allocation Table   The current table was produced in       Investigate and  when necessary  carry out enforcement activities to clear interference or illegal use from the spectrum   Until June      Ofcom investigated all interference cases within the UK   Interference reporting has now been transferred to the BBC   This contract specifically excludes any requirement to investigate interference relating to AM radio reception      Commercial and spectrum licence holders report to Ofcom and in all cases illegal   pirate   radio operations are still reported to Ofcom  Postal services edit  In October      the government announced plans for Ofcom to inherit the functions of Postcomm as part of a wider set of public service sell off measures      Following the Postal Services Act      regulatory responsibility for postal services transferred to Ofcom on   October       with its primary duty to maintain the UK s six day a week universal postal service   Consultations edit  Ofcom makes extensive use of consultations with industry and the public to help it make decisions based upon the evidence presented  Consultation processes begin with publishing documents on its website      asking for views and responses  If the document is perceived to be long and complicated  a plain English summary is usually published as well  A period  usually of    weeks  is allowed for interested persons  companies or organisations to send in their responses to the consultation  After this consultation period  Ofcom publishes all the responses on its website  excluding any personal or confidential information  Ofcom then prepares a summary of the responses received  and uses this information as a basis for its decisions       Leadership edit  Current edit  Lord  Terry  Burns was appointed as chairman of Ofcom for a four year term from   January           The current Chief Executive is Melanie Dawes who was appointed on    February            Historical edit  The first chairman of Ofcom             was David Currie  Dean of Cass Business School at City University and a life peer under the title Lord Currie of Marylebone  The first chief executive             was Stephen Carter  Baron Carter of Barnes  formerly a senior executive of JWT UK and NTL and subsequently a Minister for Communications  Technology and Broadcasting      Colette Bowe was appointed Ofcom chairman with effect from    March                   She was the founding chairman of the Telecoms Ombudsman Council  and chaired Ofcom s Consumer Panel from its inception in      to December       Dame Patricia Hodgson DBE was appointed as chairman of Ofcom for a three year term from April        She was a member of the Ofcom board from July      and became deputy chairman in January           On    July      it was announced that her term would be extended for a further year until           Sharon White was Ofcom s chief executive from      to       having replaced Ed Richards in the role      After Sharon White was appointed the Chief Executive of John Lewis in June           the office of Chief Executive remained open until Jonathan Oxley was appointed as Interim Chief Executive      In February      it was announced that Melanie Dawes would become the new Chief Executive      On    March      it was announced that Steve Gettings would become Corporation Secretary in succession to Graham Howell       Key personnel edit  Ofcom s key personnel are       Chief Executive  Melanie Dawes  appointed February      Board members

committees edit  Ofcom has a number of committees and advisory bodies which inform the Ofcom Board and Executive  These include       Communications Consumer Panel  CCP  Advisory Committee for Older and Disabled People  ACOD  Risk and Audit Committee Nominations Committee Remuneration Committee Election Committee Non Executive Remuneration Committee Nations Committee Advisory Committee for England Advisory Committee for Northern Ireland Advisory Committee for Scotland Advisory Committee for Wales Community Radio Fund Panel Ofcom Spectrum Advisory Board  OSAB  Broadcast Licensing Committee Controversies edit  Expenditure edit  Ofcom has received criticism for incurring unnecessary costs as a result of  extravagant Thames side offices  and a  top heavy salary bill       for inflexibility in its regulation of commercial radio      and for  poor service       In response to ongoing expenditure concerns  Ofcom made the following statement regarding the           budget   Ofcom has delivered    consecutive years of like for like real terms budget reductions  and we will continue to reduce spending wherever we can        Al Jazeera edit  The Qatar based newsmedia outlet was reported     to Ofcom in January       following an expos  about Israeli diplomatic     corp irregularities and influence peddling amongst political and student groups in the UK  After investigations exceeding eight months  Ofcom reported that Al Jazeera was in line with journalism standards and cleared the filmmakers of the allegations       Press TV edit  In May       Ofcom ruled that Press TV  an Iranian English language satellite channel  was responsible for a serious breach of UK broadcasting rules and could face a fine for airing an interview with Maziar Bahari  the Newsweek journalist arrested covering the Iranian presidential election in       that was obtained by force while he was held in a Tehran jail      Upon the release of Ofcom s findings  Press TV claimed that Maziar Bahari was  an MI  contact person      taking guidance from  The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion  protocol No          Press TV called Ofcom s ruling  part of an anti Iranian campaign    and that  A quick look at senior decision makers at OFCOM demonstrates that the regulator is mostly made up of former Channel   and BBC executives  some of whom are well linked to and influenced by powerful pro Israeli politicians            Sitefinder database and freedom of information edit  The Sitefinder database is a national database of mobile phone base stations in the UK      In September      an Information Tribunal ruled that the public should have access to the database under the Freedom of Information Act           However  as Ofcom has no legal power to force mobile phone operators to add information to the database  UK mobile phone operators consequently ceased updating it      Ofcom appealed against the Freedom of Information Act ruling  together with one UK mobile operator   T Mobile      This has led to accusations of the organisation s complicity with the mobile telecommunications industry in keeping information about mast locations secret      Ofcom s stated reasons for the appeal have ranged from  preventing terrorist attacks  on the sites of phone masts to  protecting the intellectual property  of the mobile telecommunications industry      In April       the High Court found in favour of the Information Commissioner s Office and over ruled Ofcom s objections  Ofcom appealed to the Supreme Court  who in turn referred a point of law to the European Court of Justice  and then in October      ordered that the matter should be remitted to the Information Rights Tribunal to reconsider the public interest balancing exercise      On    December       the Information Rights Tribunal upheld its decision of   September            Deryn Consulting controversy edit  In      Ofcom s advisory committee for Wales awarded Deryn Consulting a contract to monitor the National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Government  It was subsequently reported that the contract had not been put out to tender and that Huw Roberts and Nerys Evans held positions for both Deryn and Ofcom          The contract was terminated     and Ofcom concluded that it had broken its own procurement rules       Abu Dhabi TV edit  The Abu Dhabi TV Media was condemned by Ofcom for broadcasting a televised interview of the confessions made by Qatari citizen  Dr  Mahmoud Al Jaida while detained arbitrarily in the Abu Dhabi prisons in       The National Human Rights Committee of the State of Qatar welcomed the decision of the UK office of communication  Under the decision  it was stated that on    June       the Abu Dhabi TV channel  which is affiliated with Abu Dhabi Media Company P J S C  ADMC   licensed under Ofcom had broadcast an interview recording titled  Mahmoud Al Jaidah and the clandestine organization in UAE   According to the decision  the aired interview was recorded against the consent of Dr  Al Jaidah  who was physically tortured during his time in the Abu Dhabi prison  The activity had constituted a serious breach of the principles of fairness and privacy detailed in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code            See also edit  Advertising Standards Authority Annan Committee  that in      recommended the establishment of
