department announced that it would purchase     of the output of the    MW Sheffield  Vermont  wind generated electricity when it became available        Renewable Energy edit  Burlington began operating on      renewable energy in      after being a pioneer in the renewable energy sector for decades  The Burlington Electric Department  which began operating in       originally used coal as a primary source of energy  However  after experiencing the effects of fluctuating coal prices throughout the second World War  they slowly began using wood as an energy source because of the price and energy efficiency of wood       Since then  the city has experienced a sustainability boom  and today runs on      renewable energy  A succession of mayors in the city  along with corresponding public interest are credited with this change  Gordon Paquette made the decision to completely transition from coal to wood at the McNeil Generating Station in       and Bernie Sanders picked up this momentum of the environmental movement in the small city  This continued with Peter Clavelle  who mandated recycling in the city  and passed a number of bonds which funded energy improvements in infrastructure  In       the city issued the Legacy Plan  which aimed to  go beyond the branding and rhetoric and create actual examples that will resonate and make a difference in people s lives        Today  that plan has come to fruition in many ways  The city operates entirely on energy from the Winooski One Hydro Plant  a series of wind turbines  solar panels  as well as the sustainably sourced wood burning at McNeil Generating Station       This made Burlington the first city to run completely on sustainable energy sources  a landmark for green infrastructure  Along with keeping energy rates low for customers  sustainability in the city extends beyond energy infrastructure  A non profit in the city started an incubator farm that produces        pounds of fresh  local food for those facing food insecurity  The city has also worked on drastic building restoration projects  installed bikeways for more efficient transportation  and prioritized energy saving in the downtown   In September       the current mayor Miro Weignberger announced plans to get the city to  net zero  status by       This would mean that the city would produce and consume equal amounts of energy  In October       Burlington Electric proposed an ordinance that would require all buildings in the city to switch to electric energy sources       This would put the city closer to that net zero goal  and continues its legacy as a trailblazer for sustainable infrastructure   Notable people edit  Main article  List of people from Burlington  Vermont   Sister and friendship cities edit  See also
