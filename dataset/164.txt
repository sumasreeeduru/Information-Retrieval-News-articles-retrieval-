Journalismvte The propaganda model is a conceptual model in political economy advanced by Edward S  Herman and Noam Chomsky to explain how propaganda and systemic biases function in corporate mass media  The model seeks to explain how populations are manipulated and how consent for economic  social  and political policies  both foreign and domestic  is  manufactured  in the public mind due to this propaganda  The theory posits that the way in which corporate media is structured  e g  through advertising  concentration of media ownership or government sourcing  creates an inherent conflict of interest and therefore acts as propaganda for anti democratic elements  First presented in their      book Manufacturing Consent  The Political Economy of the Mass Media  the propaganda model views corporate media as businesses interested in the sale of a product readers and audiences to other businesses  advertisers  rather than the pursuit of quality journalism in service of the public  Describing the media s  societal purpose   Chomsky writes       the study of institutions and how they function must be scrupulously ignored  apart from fringe elements or a relatively obscure scholarly literature      The theory postulates five general classes of  filters  that determine the type of news that is presented in news media  These five classes are  ownership of the medium  the medium s funding sources  sourcing  flak  and anti communism or  fear ideology   The first three are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important  In versions published after the      attacks on the United States in       Chomsky and Herman updated the fifth prong to instead refer to the  War on Terror  and  counter terrorism   which they state operates in much the same manner  Although the model was based mainly on the media of the United States  Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles that the model postulates as the cause of media biases     Their assessment has been confirmed by a number of scholars and the propaganda role of the media has since been empirically assessed in Western Europe and Latin America      Contents    Filters      Ownership     Advertising     Sourcing     Flak     Anti Communism and fear     Case examples      Coverage of

videos     Filters edit  Ownership edit  The size and profit seeking imperative of dominant media corporations create a bias  The authors point to how in the early nineteenth century  a radical British press had emerged that addressed the concerns of workers  but excessive stamp duties  designed to restrict newspaper ownership to the  respectable  wealthy  began to change the face of the press  Nevertheless  there remained a degree of diversity  In post World War II Britain  radical or worker friendly newspapers such as the Daily Herald  News Chronicle  Sunday Citizen  all since failed or absorbed into other publications   and the Daily Mirror  at least until the late     s  regularly published articles questioning the capitalist system  The authors posit that these earlier radical papers were not constrained by corporate ownership and therefore  were free to criticize the capitalist system    A table of six big media conglomerates in       including some of their subsidiaries     unreliable source   Herman and Chomsky argue that since mainstream media outlets are currently either large corporations or part of conglomerates  e g  Westinghouse or General Electric   the information presented to the public will be biased with respect to these interests  Such conglomerates frequently extend beyond traditional media fields and thus have extensive financial interests that may be endangered when certain information is publicized  According to this reasoning  news items that most endanger the corporate financial interests of those who own the media will face the greatest bias and censorship  It then follows that if to maximize profit means sacrificing news objectivity  then the news sources that ultimately survive must be fundamentally biased  with regard to news in which they have a conflict of interest   Advertising edit  The second filter of the propaganda model is funding generated through advertising  Most newspapers have to attract advertising in order to cover the costs of production  without it  they would have to increase the price of their newspaper  There is fierce competition throughout the media to attract advertisers  a newspaper which gets less advertising than its competitors is at a serious disadvantage  Lack of success in raising advertising revenue was another factor in the demise of the  people s newspapers  of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  The product is composed of the affluent readers who buy the newspaper who also comprise the educated decision making sector of the population while the actual clientele served by the newspaper includes the businesses that pay to advertise their goods  According to this filter  the news is  filler  to get privileged readers to see the advertisements which makes up the content and will thus take whatever form is most conducive to attracting educated decision makers  Stories that conflict with their  buying mood   it is argued  will tend to be marginalized or excluded  along with information that presents a picture of the world that collides with advertisers  interests  The theory argues that the people buying the newspaper are the product which is sold to the businesses that buy advertising space  the news has only a marginal role as the product   Sourcing edit  The third of Herman and Chomsky s five filters relates to the sourcing of mass media news   The mass media are drawn into a symbiotic relationship with powerful sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest   Even large media corporations such as the BBC cannot afford to place reporters everywhere  They concentrate their resources where news stories are likely to happen  the White House  the Pentagon     Downing Street and other central news  terminals   Although British newspapers may occasionally complain about the  spin doctoring  of New Labour  for example  they are dependent upon the pronouncements of  the Prime Minister s personal spokesperson  for government news  Business corporations and trade organizations are also trusted sources of stories considered newsworthy  Editors and journalists who offend these powerful news sources  perhaps by questioning the veracity or bias of the furnished material  can be threatened with the denial of access to their media life blood   fresh news     Thus  the media has become reluctant to run articles that will harm corporate interests that provide them with the resources that they depend upon  This relationship also gives rise to a  moral division of labor   in which  officials have and give the facts  and  reporters merely get them   Journalists are then supposed to adopt an uncritical attitude that makes it possible for them to accept corporate values without experiencing cognitive dissonance   Flak edit  The fourth filter is  flak   not to be confused with flack which means promoters or publicity agents   described by Herman and Chomsky as  negative responses to a media statement or  TV or radio  program  It may take the form of letters  telegrams  phone calls  petitions  lawsuits  speeches and Bills before Congress and other modes of complaint  threat and punitive action   Business organizations regularly come together to form flak machines  An example is the US based Global Climate Coalition  GCC   comprising fossil fuel and automobile companies such as Exxon  Texaco and Ford  The GCC was started up by Burson Marsteller  one of the world s largest public relations companies  to attack the credibility of climate scientists and  scare stories  about global warming     For Chomsky and Herman  flak  refers to negative responses to a media statement or program  The term  flak  has been used to describe what Chomsky and Herman see as efforts to discredit organizations or individuals who disagree with or cast doubt on the prevailing assumptions which Chomsky and Herman view as favorable to established power  e g    The Establishment    Unlike the first three  filtering  mechanisms which are derived from analysis of market mechanisms flak is characterized by concerted efforts to manage public information   Anti Communism and fear edit  So I think when we talked about the  fifth filter  we should have brought in all this stuff    the way artificial fears are created with a dual purpose    partly to get rid of people you don t like but partly to frighten the rest  Because if people are frightened  they will accept authority   Noam Chomsky    The fifth and final news filter that Herman and Chomsky identified was  anti communism   Manufacturing Consent was written during the Cold War  Chomsky updated the model as  fear   often as  the enemy  or an  evil dictator  such as Colonel Gaddafi  Paul Biya  Saddam Hussein  Slobodan Milosevic  or Vladimir Putin  This is exemplified in British tabloid headlines of  Smash Saddam   and  Clobba Slobba       The same is said to extend to mainstream reporting of environmentalists as  eco terrorists   The Sunday Times ran a series of articles in      accusing activists from the non violent direct action group Reclaim The Streets of stocking up on CS gas and stun guns     Anti ideologies exploit public fear and hatred of groups that pose a potential threat  either real  exaggerated or imagined  Communism once posed the primary threat according to the model  Communism and socialism were portrayed by their detractors as endangering freedoms of speech  movement  the press and so forth  They argue that such a portrayal was often used as a means to silence voices critical of elite interests  Chomsky argues that since the end of the Cold War         anticommunism was replaced by the  War on Terror   as the major social control mechanism   Anti communism has receded as an ideological factor in the Western media  but it is not dead    The  war on terror  has provided a useful substitute for the Soviet Menace      Following the events of September           some scholars agree that Islamophobia is replacing anti communism as a new source of public fear       Case examples edit  Following the theoretical exposition of the propaganda model  Manufacturing Consent contains a large section where the authors seek to test their hypotheses  If the propaganda model is right and the filters do influence media content  a particular form of bias would be expected one that systematically favors corporate interests  They also looked at what they perceived as naturally occurring  historical control groups  where two events  similar in their properties but differing in the expected media attitude towards them  are contrasted using objective measures such as coverage of key events  measured in column inches  or editorials favoring a particular issue  measured in number    Coverage of  enemy  countries edit    The polls  show that all of the opposition parties in Nicaragua combined had the support of only   percent of the population  but they have     percent of Stephen Kinzer   Noam Chomsky       Examples of bias given by the authors include the failure of the media to question the legality of the Vietnam War while greatly emphasizing the Soviet Afghan War as an act of aggression      Other biases include a propensity to emphasize violent acts such as genocide more in enemy or unfriendly countries such as Kosovo while ignoring greater genocide in allied countries such as the Indonesian occupation of East Timor      This bias is also said to exist in foreign elections  giving favorable media coverage to fraudulent elections in allied countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala  while unfavorable coverage is given to legitimate elections in enemy countries such as Nicaragua        A study found that in the lead up to the Iraq War  most sources were overwhelmingly in favor of the invasion  Chomsky also asserts that the media accurately covered events such as the Battle of Fallujah but because of an ideological bias  it acted as pro government propaganda  In describing coverage of raid on Fallujah General Hospital he stated that The New York Times   accurately recorded the battle of Fallujah but it was celebrated    it was a celebration of ongoing war crimes       The article in question was  Early Target of Offensive Is a Hospital    Scandals of leaks edit  The authors point to biases that are based on only reporting scandals which benefit a section of power  while ignoring scandals that hurt the powerless  The biggest example of this was how the US media greatly covered the Watergate Scandal but ignored the COINTELPRO exposures  While the Watergate break in was a political threat to powerful people  Democrats   COINTELPRO harmed average citizens and went as far as political assassination  Other examples include coverage of the Iran Contra affair by only focusing on people in power such as Oliver North but omitting coverage of the civilians killed in Nicaragua as the result of aid to the contras  In a      interview  Chomsky compared media coverage of the Afghan War Diaries released by WikiLeaks and lack of media coverage to a study of severe health problems in Fallujah      While there was ample coverage of WikiLeaks there was no American coverage of the Fallujah study      in which the health situation in Fallujah was described by the British media as  worse than Hiroshima        Applications edit  See also  Media coverage of the Iraq War and Media coverage of climate change Since the publication of Manufacturing Consent  Herman and Chomsky have adopted the theory and have given it a prominent role in their writings  lectures and theoretical frameworks  Chomsky has made extensive use of its explanative power to lend support to his interpretations of mainstream media attitudes towards a wide array of events  including the following   Gulf War         the media s failure to report on Saddam s peace offers      Iraq invasion         the media s failure to report on the legality of the war     despite overwhelming public opinion in favor of only invading Iraq with UN authorization          According to the liberal watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting  there was a disproportionate focus on pro war sources while total anti war sources only made up     of the media  with only    of US sources being anti war       Global warming  the media gives near equal balance to people who deny climate change     despite only  about one percent  of climate scientists taking this view      Chomsky commented that there are  three sides  on climate change  deniers  those who follow the scientific consensus  and people who think that the consensus underestimates the threat from global warming   but in framing the debate the media usually ignore people who say that the scientific consensus is unduly optimistic      Reception edit  On the rare occasions the propaganda model is discussed in the mainstream media there is usually a large reaction  In       when Chomsky was interviewed by Bill Moyers there were       letters in response  one of the biggest written reactions in the show s history  When he was interviewed by TV Ontario  the show generated        call ins  which was a new record for the station  In       when Chomsky was interviewed by Andrew Marr the producer commented that the response was  astonishing   He commented that   t he audience reaction was astonishing    I have never worked on a programme which elicited so many letters and calls       In May       Chomsky and Herman spoke at the University of Windsor in Canada summarizing developments and responding to criticisms related to the model      Both authors stated they felt the propaganda model is still applicable  Herman said even more so than when it was introduced   although they did suggest a few areas where they believe it falls short and needs to be extended in light of recent developments      Chomsky has insisted that while the propaganda role of the media  is intensified by ownership and advertising  the problem mostly lies with  ideological doctrinal commitments that are part of intellectual life  or intellectual culture of the people in power  He compares the media to scholarly literature which he says has the same problems even without the constraints of the propaganda model      At the Windsor talk  Chomsky pointed out that Edward S  Herman was primarily responsible for creating the theory although Chomsky supported it  According to Chomsky  he insisted Herman s name appear first on the cover of Manufacturing Consent because of his primary role researching and developing the theory       American pressure groups edit  With the emergence of the Internet as a cheap and potentially wide ranging means of communication  a number of independent websites have surfaced which adopt the propaganda model to subject media to close scrutiny  Examples of these are Free Press and FAIR   Harvard media torture study edit   From the early     s until         the newspapers that covered waterboarding almost uniformly called the practice torture or implied it was torture  The New York Times characterized it thus in           of     of articles on the subject and the Los Angeles Times did so in       of articles     of      By contrast  from            the studied newspapers almost never referred to waterboarding as torture   Desai et al        In April       a study conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School showed that media outlets such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times stopped using the term  torture  for waterboarding when the US government committed it  from      to           It also noted that the press was  much more likely to call waterboarding torture if a country other than the United States is the perpetrator       The study was similar to media studies done in Manufacturing Consent for topics such as comparing how the term  genocide  is used in the media when referring to allied and enemy countries  Glenn Greenwald in response said that  We don t need a state run media because our media outlets volunteer for the task     and commented that the media often act as propaganda for the government without coercion       Studies of media outside the United States edit  Chomsky has commented in the  ChomskyChat Forum  on the applicability of the Propaganda Model to the media environment of other countries    That s only rarely been done in any systematic way  There is work on the British media  by a good U niversity  of Glasgow media group  And interesting work on British Central America coverage by Mark Curtis in his book Ambiguities of Power  There is work on France  done in Belgium mostly  also a recent book by Serge Halimi  editor of Le Monde diplomatique   There is one very careful study by a Dutch graduate student  applying the methods Ed Herman used in studying US media reaction to elections  El Salvador  Nicaragua  to    major European newspapers      Interesting results  Discussed a bit  along with some others  in a footnote in chapter   of my book  Deterring Democracy   if you happen to have that around     For more than a decade  a British based website Media Lens has examined their domestic broadcasters and liberal press  Its criticisms are featured in the books Guardians of Power            and Newspeak in the   st Century             Studies have also expanded the propaganda model to examine news media in the People s Republic of China     and for film production in Hollywood       News of the World edit  Main article  News of the World phone hacking affair In July       the journalist Paul Mason  then working for the BBC  pointed out that the News International phone hacking scandal threw light on close links between the press and politicians  However  he argued that the closure of the mass circulation newspaper News of the World  which took place after the scandal broke  conformed only partly to the propaganda model  He drew attention to the role of social media  saying that  large corporations pulled their advertising  because of the  scale of the social media response   a response which was mainly to do with the newspaper s behaviour towards Milly Dowler  although Mason did not go into this level of detail       Mason praised The Guardian for having told the truth about the phone hacking  but expressed doubt about the financial viability of the newspaper   One part of the Chomsky doctrine has been proven by exception  He stated that newspapers that told the truth could not make money  The Guardian   is indeed burning money and may run out of it in three years  time      Criticism edit  The Anti Chomsky Reader edit  Eli Lehrer of the  American Enterprise Institute criticized the theory in The Anti Chomsky Reader  According to Lehrer  the fact that papers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have disagreements is evidence that the media is not a monolithic entity  Lehrer also believes that the media cannot have a corporate bias because it reports on and exposes corporate corruption  Lehrer asserts that the model amounts to a Marxist conception of right wing false consciousness      Herman and Chomsky have asserted that the media  is not a solid monolith  but that it represents a debate between powerful interests while ignoring perspectives that challenge the  fundamental premises  of all these interests      For instance  during the Vietnam War there was disagreement among the media over tactics  but the broader issue of the legality and legitimacy of the war was ignored  see Coverage of  enemy  countries   Additionally  Chomsky has said that while the media are against corruption  they are not against society legally empowering corporate interests which is a reflection of the powerful interests that the model would predict      The authors have also said that the model does not seek to address  the effects of the media on the public  which might be ineffective at shaping public opinion      Edward Herman has said  critics failed to comprehend that the propaganda model is about how the media work  not how effective they are        Inroads  A Journal of Opinion edit  Gareth Morley argues in an article in Inroads  A Journal of Opinion that widespread coverage of Israeli mistreatment of protesters as compared with little coverage of similar  or much worse  events in sub Saharan Africa is poorly explained      This was in response to Chomsky s assertion that in testing the Model  examples should be carefully paired to control reasons for discrepancies not related to political bias      Chomsky himself cites the examples of government mis treatment of protesters and points out that general coverage of the two areas compared should be similar  raising the point that they are not  news from Israel  in any form  is far more common than news from sub Saharan Africa  Morley considers this approach dubiously empirical       The New York Times review edit  Writing for The New York Times  the historian Walter LaFeber criticized the book Manufacturing Consent for overstating its case  in particular with regards to reporting on Nicaragua and not adequately explaining how a powerful propaganda system would let military aid to the Contra rebels be blocked      Herman responded in a letter by stating that the system was not  all powerful  and that LaFeber did not address their main point regarding Nicaragua  LaFeber replied that   Mr  Herman wants to have it both ways  to claim that leading American journals  mobilize bias  but object when I cite crucial examples that weaken the book s thesis  If the news media are so unqualifiedly bad  the book should at least explain why so many publications  including my own  can cite their stories to attack President Reagan s Central American policy      Chomsky responds to LaFeber s reply in Necessary Illusions   What is more  a propaganda model is not weakened by the discovery that with careful and critical reading  material could be unearthed in the media that could be used by those that objected to  President Reagan s Central American policy  on grounds of principle  opposing not its failures but its successes  the near destruction of Nicaragua and the blunting of the popular forces that threatened to bring democracy and social reform to El Salvador  among other achievements      See also edit  Concentration of media ownership Corporate censorship Crowd manipulation Edward Bernays Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting
