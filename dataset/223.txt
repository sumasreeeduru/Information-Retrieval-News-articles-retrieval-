Hussein tried secretly to arrange a peace agreement in which Israel would concede the West Bank to Jordan  The two signed an agreement defining a framework for a Middle Eastern peace conference  The proposal was not consummated due to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir s objection  The following year Jordan abandoned its claim to the West Bank in favor of a peaceful resolution between Israel and the PLO        Discussions began in       Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres informed King Hussein that after the Oslo Accords with the PLO  Jordan might be  left out of the big game   Hussein consulted with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez al Assad  Mubarak encouraged him  but Assad told him only to  talk  and not sign any accord  U S  President Bill Clinton pressured Hussein to start peace negotiations and to sign a peace treaty with Israel and promised him that Jordan s debts would be forgiven  The efforts succeeded and Jordan signed a nonbelligerency agreement with Israel  Rabin  Hussein and Clinton signed the Washington Declaration in Washington  DC  on    July          The Declaration says that Israel and Jordan ended the official state of enmity and would start negotiations in order to achieve an  end to bloodshed and sorrow  and a just and lasting peace      Signing On    October       Jordan and Israel signed the peace treaty    in a ceremony held in the Arava valley of Israel  north of Eilat and near the Jordanian border  Prime Minister Rabin and Prime Minister Abdelsalam al Majali signed

TVs in order not to miss the historical moment of signing a second peace treaty with an Arab state  citation needed   Content The peace treaty consists of a preamble     articles    annexes  and

Main principles Borders  The international boundary between Israel and Jordan follows the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers  the Dead Sea  the Emek Ha Arava Wadi Araba  and the Gulf of Aqaba     The section

 Jerusalem  Article   links the Peace Treaty to the Israeli Palestinian peace process  Israel recognized the special role of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem and committed itself to give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in these shrines in negotiations on the permanent status  Water  Israel agreed to give Jordan            cubic metres          cu ft  of water each year and for Jordan to own     of the water from the Yarmouk River  Both countries could develop other water resources and reservoirs and agreed to help each other survive droughts  Israel also agreed to help Jordan use desalination technology in order to find additional water      Palestinian refugees  Israel and Jordan agreed to cooperate to help the refugees  including a four way committee  Israel  Jordan  Egypt and the Palestinians  to try to work towards solutions  Follow up Following the agreements  Israel and Jordan opened their borders  Several border crossings were erected  allowing tourists  businessmen and workers to travel between the two countries      Israeli tourists started to visit Jordan  many to see the sela ha adom   Red Rock   of Petra   a stone carved city of the Nabataeans which had fascinated Israelis during the     s and     s  often luring adventurers to visit it secretly  On   November      the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist  who aimed to undermine Rabin s peace efforts with the Palestinians      Due to the close relationship forged with Rabin during the negotiations of the treaty  Hussein was invited to give a speech during Rabin s funeral in Jerusalem      This was the first time Hussein had been in Jerusalem since the      war      Hussein drew parallels between Rabin s assassination and his grandfather s assassination in        We are not ashamed  nor are we afraid  nor are we anything but determined to continue the legacy for which my friend fell  as did my grandfather in this city when I was with him and but a boy       Jordan s signing of a peace treaty with Israel  and other issues  were met with disdain by Syria s president Hafez Al Assad      The CIA handed the King a detailed report in December      warning him of a Syrian plot to assassinate him and his brother Hassan      A month later  the CIA sent Hussein another report warning Jordan of Iraqi plots to attack Western targets in Jordan to undermine Jordan s security due to its support for the Iraqi opposition      In Israel  Shimon Peres of the leftist Labor Party and Benjamin Netanyahu of the right wing Likud party  were competing for the post of prime minister      Hussein s popularity in Israel had peaked after the peace treaty was signed  and he was expected to express support for a candidate      Hussein initially remained neutral  but later expressed support for Netanyahu      Efraim Halevy  then head of the Israeli intelligence agency  Mossad   claims that Hussein had preferred Netanyahu over Peres as he had deeply mistrusted the latter      The Israeli general election held on    May      witnessed Netanyahu s ascension to the prime ministry        My distress is genuine and deep over the accumulating tragic actions which you have initiated at the head of the Government of Israel  making peace   the worthiest objective of my life   appear more and more like a distant elusive mirage  I could remain aloof if the very lives of all Arabs and Israelis and their future were not fast sliding towards an abyss of bloodshed and disaster  brought about by fear and despair  I frankly cannot accept your repeated excuse of having to act the way you do under great duress and pressure  I cannot believe that the people of Israel seek bloodshed and disaster and oppose peace  Nor can I believe that the most constitutionally powerful Prime Minister in Israeli history would act on other than his total convictions  The saddest reality that has been dawning on me is that I do not find you by my side in working to fulfill God s will for the final reconciliation of all the descendants of the children of Abraham  Your course of actions seems bent on destroying all I believe in or have striven to achieve       From King Hussein s letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on   March        Hussein s support for Netanyahu soon backfired      Israel s actions during the      Qana massacre in Southern Lebanon  the Likud government s decision to build settlements in East Jerusalem  and the events at the Temple Mount where clashes between Palestinian and Israeli police ensued after Israeli tunnel diggings around the Mount  generated an uproar of criticism for Netanyahu in the Arab World      On   March      Hussein sent Netanyahu a three page letter expressing his disappointment      The King lambasted Netanyahu  with the letter s opening sentence stating   My distress is genuine and deep over the accumulating tragic actions which you have initiated at the head of the Government of Israel  making peace   the worthiest objective of my life   appear more and more like a distant elusive mirage       Four days later  on    March  a Jordanian soldier patrolling the borders between Jordan and Israel in the north near the Island of Peace  killed seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded six others      The King  who was on an official visit to Spain  returned home immediately      He travelled to the Israeli town of Beit Shemesh to offer his condolences to the grieving families of the Israeli children killed      He went on his knees in front of the families  telling them that the incident was  a crime that is a shame for all of us  I feel as if I have lost a child of my own  If there is any purpose in life it will be to make sure that all the children no longer suffer the way our generation did       His gesture was received very warmly in Israel  and Hussein sent the families    million in total as compensation for the loss of life      The soldier was determined to be mentally unstable by a Jordanian military tribunal and was sentenced to    years in prison  which he served entirely      Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank surfaced      Hussein s wife  Queen Noor  later claimed her husband was having trouble sleeping   Everything he had worked for all his life  every relationship he had painstakingly built on trust and respect  every dream of peace and prosperity he had had for Jordan s children  was turning into a nightmare  I really did not know how much more Hussein could take       On    September      eight Mossad agents entered Jordan using fake Canadian passports and attempted to assassinate Jordanian citizen Khaled Mashal  head of the militant Islamist Palestinian group Hamas      Hussein was preparing for a    year Hamas Israel truce three days prior to the attempt  after Hamas had launched two attacks in Jerusalem      Two Mossad agents followed Mashal to his office and injected poison into his ears  but they were caught by Mashal s bodyguard      The two agents were then held by the Jordanian police  while the six other agents hid in the Israeli embassy      Furious  Hussein met with an Israeli delegate who attempted to explain the situation  the King said in a speech about the incident that he felt that somebody  had spat in his face       Jordanian authorities requested Netanyahu to provide an antidote to save Mashal s life  but Netanyahu refused to do so      Jordan then threatened to storm the Israeli embassy and capture the rest of the Mossad team  but Israel argued that it would be against the Geneva Conventions      Jordan replied that the Geneva Conventions  do not apply to terrorists   and a special operations team headed by Hussein s son Abdullah was put in charge of the operation      Hussein called American President Clinton and requested his intervention  threatening to annul the treaty if Israel did not provide the antidote      Clinton later managed to get Israel s approval to reveal the name of the antidote  and complained about Netanyahu   This man is impossible       Khaled Mashal recovered  but Jordan s relations with Israel deteriorated and Israeli requests to contact Hussein were rebuffed      The Mossad operatives were released by Jordan after Israel agreed to release    Jordanian and    Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin      Mounting opposition in Jordan to the peace treaty with Israel led Hussein to put greater restrictions on freedom of speech      Several dissidents were imprisoned including Laith Shubeilat  a prominent Islamist  A few months into his imprisonment  the King personally gave Shubeilat  his fiercest critic  a ride home from the Swaqa prison      However  the crackdown led the opposition groups in Jordan to boycott the      parliamentary elections      In      Jordan refused a secret request from Netanyahu to attack Iraq using Jordanian airspace after claiming Saddam held weapons of mass destruction      In December       Israel and Jordan signed an agreement to build a desalination plant on the Red Sea  near the Jordanian port of Aqaba  as part of the Red Sea Dead Sea Canal      In October       Jordan notified Israel of its intention not to renew lands leased under Annex I of the agreement  The annex granted Jordan the right not to renew the lease of Naharayim  Baqoura  and Tzofar Al Ghamr after    years  given that a notice is given a year prior       Gallery     Shimon Peres  left  with Yitzhak Rabin  center  and King Hussein of Jordan
