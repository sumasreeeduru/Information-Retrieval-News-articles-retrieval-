       Transatlantic telegraph cable  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Undersea cable    Map of the      trans Atlantic cable route Transatlantic telegraph cables were undersea cables running under the Atlantic Ocean used for telegraph communications  Telegraphy is now an obsolete form of communication and the cables have long since been decommissioned  but telephone and data are still carried on other transatlantic telecommunications cables  The first cable was laid in the     s across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field  Foilhommerum Bay  Valentia Island in western Ireland to Heart s Content in eastern Newfoundland  The first communications occurred August           reducing the communication time between North America and Europe from ten days the time it took to deliver a message by ship to a matter of minutes  Cyrus West Field and the Atlantic Telegraph Company were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable     The project began in      and was completed in       The cable functioned for only three weeks  but it was the first such project to yield practical results  The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to President of the United States James Buchanan on August     Signal quality declined rapidly  slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed  The cable was destroyed the following month when Wildman Whitehouse applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation  It has been argued that the faulty manufacture  storage and handling of the      cable would have led to premature failure in any case     The cable s rapid failure undermined public and investor confidence and delayed efforts to restore a connection  The second cable was laid in      with much improved material  The cable was laid with the ship SS Great Eastern  built by John Scott Russell and Isambard Kingdom Brunel and skippered by Sir James Anderson  More than halfway across  the cable broke and after many rescue attempts  they had to give up     In      a third cable was laid with Great Eastern and connection completed and the cable put into service on July           The      cable was also retrieved and spliced so two cables were in service     These cables proved more durable  In the     s duplex and quadruplex transmission and receiving systems were set up that could relay multiple messages over the cable     Before the first transatlantic cable  communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship  Sometimes  however  severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks  The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably  allowing a message and a response

Submarine communications cable  Recording of Queen Victoria s message to James Buchanan In the     s and     s several individuals proposed or advocated construction of a telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean  including Edward Thornton and Alonzo Jackman     As early as      Samuel F  B  Morse proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the Atlantic Ocean  By      a cable was run between England and France  That same year Bishop John T  Mullock  head of the Roman Catholic Church in Newfoundland  proposed a telegraph line through the forest from St  John s to Cape Ray  and cables across the Gulf of St  Lawrence from Cape Ray to Nova Scotia across the Cabot Strait  At about the same time a similar plan occurred to Frederic Newton Gisborne  a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia  In the spring of       Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and  having formed a company  began the construction of the landline  In      his company collapsed  he was arrested for debt and he lost everything   A plan takes shape edit  In      Gisborne was introduced to Cyrus West Field  Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project  From his visitor  Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean  Field was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea  He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant Matthew Maury  an authority on oceanography   The charts Maury constructed from soundings in the logs of multiple ships indicated that there was a feasible route across the Atlantic   The area seemed so ideal for cable laying that Maury named it Telegraph Plateau   Maury s charts also predicted that a route going directly to the US was too rugged to be tenable  as well as being longer      Field adopted Gisborne s scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking  and promoted the New York  Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe  The first step was to finish the line between St  John s and Nova Scotia  which was undertaken by Gisborne and Field s brother  Matthew      In      an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence  It was laid out from a barque in tow of a steamer  When half the cable was laid  a gale rose  and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking  In      a steamboat was fitted out for the purpose  and the link from Cape Ray  Newfoundland to Aspy Bay  Nova Scotia was successfully laid      The final cost of the project exceeded    million  but the transatlantic segment was going to cost much more      In       Field crossed the Atlantic  the first of    crossings in the course of the project      to consult with John Watkins Brett who was the greatest authority on submarine cables at that time   Brett s Submarine Telegraph Company laid the first ocean cable in      across the English Channel and his English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company had laid a cable to Ireland in      which was the deepest cable laid up to that date       Further reasons for the trip were that all the commercial manufacturers of submarine cable were in Britain     and Field had failed to raise significant funds for the project in New York      Field pushed the project ahead with tremendous energy and speed   Even before forming a company to carry out the project  Field ordered       miles of cable from the Gutta Percha Company       The Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed in October      with Brett as president and Field as vice president   Charles Tilston Bright  who already worked for Brett  was made chief engineer   Wildman Whitehouse  a medical doctor  was appointed chief electrician   Field provided a quarter of the capital himself       After the  remaining shares were sold  largely to existing investors in Brett s company      an unpaid board of directors was formed which included William Thomson  the future Lord Kelvin and a respected scientist   Thomson also acted as a scientific advisor       Morse  who was a shareholder in the Nova Scotia project and acted as the electrical advisor  was also on the board       First transatlantic cable edit   A U S  postage stamp issued to commemorate the Atlantic cable centenary The cable consisted of seven copper wires  each weighing    kg km      pounds per nautical mile   covered with three coats of gutta percha  as suggested by Jonathan Nash Hearder       weighing    kg km      pounds per nautical mile   and wound with tarred hemp  over which a sheath of    strands  each of seven iron wires  was laid in a close helix  It weighed nearly     kg km      tons per nautical mile   was relatively flexible and was able to withstand a pull of several tens of kilonewtons  several tons   The cable from the Gutta Percha Company was armoured separately by wire rope manufacturers  as was the usual practice at the time   In the rush to proceed  only four months were allowed for completion of the cable       As no wire rope maker had the capacity to make so much cable on that timescale  the task was shared by two English firms   Glass  Elliot   Co   of Greenwich  and R S  Newall and Company  of Birkenhead      Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions       This meant that the two sections of cable could not be directly spliced wire to wire as the iron wire on both cables would unwind when it was put under tension during laying       The problem was easily solved by splicing through an improvised wooden bracket to hold the wires in place      but the mistake subsequently became magnified in the public mind      The British government gave Field a subsidy of        a year           today  and loaned ships for cable laying and support  Field also solicited aid from the U S  government  A bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in Congress  The subsidy bill passed the Senate by a single vote  due to opposition from protectionist senators  In the House of Representatives  the bill encountered similar resistance  but passed  and was signed by President Franklin Pierce  The first attempt  in       was a failure  The cable laying vessels were the converted warships HMS Agamemnon and USS Niagara borrowed from their respective governments   Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold       miles of cable alone       The cable was started at the white strand near Ballycarbery Castle in County Kerry  on the southwest coast of Ireland  on August              The cable broke on the first day  but was grappled and repaired  it broke again over the Telegraph Plateau  nearly       m    statute miles  deep  and the operation was abandoned for the year       miles of cable had been lost  but the       miles remaining was still sufficient to complete the task   Also in this period  Morse clashed with Field  was removed from the board  and took no further part in the enterprise      The problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out   A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the Bay of Biscay with Agamemnon in May            On June     Agamemnon and Niagara set sail to try again   Ten days out they found themselves in a severe storm and the enterprise was nearly brought to a premature end   The ships were top heavy with cable that could not all fit in the hold and struggled not to capsize   Ten sailors were hurt and Thomson s electrical cabin was flooded      The vessels arrived at the middle of the Atlantic on June    and spliced cable from the two ships together   Agamemnon paid out eastwards towards Valentia Island  Niagara payed out westward towards Newfoundland       Again the cable repeatedly broke       The first time after less than     km  three nautical miles   again after some     km     nautical miles  and for a third time when about     km      nautical miles  of cable had run out of each vessel  The expedition returned to Queenstown  County Cork  Ireland   Some directors were in favour of abandoning the project and selling off the cable  but Field persuaded them to keep going       The ships set out again on July    and the middle splice was finished on July           The cable ran easily this time  Niagara arrived in Trinity Bay  Newfoundland on August   and the next morning the shore end was landed  Agamemnon made an equally successful run  On August    she arrived at Valentia Island  and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house       First contact edit   The Telegraph Field      Valentia Island  Ireland  the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America  In October       a memorial to mark the laying of the transatlantic cable to Newfoundland was unveiled on top of Foilhomerrum Cliff  Made of Valentia slate and designed by local sculptor Alan Hall      the memorial marks the history of the telegraph industry to the island from      forward   Celebration parade on Broadway  September         Test messages were sent from Newfoundland beginning August           the first successfully read at Valentia was on August     and the first successfully read at Newfoundland on August     further test and configuration messages followed until August     when the first official message was sent via the cable   Directors of Atlantic Telegraph Company  Great Britain  to Directors in America  Europe and America are united by telegraph  Glory to God in the highest  on earth peace  good will towards men               Next was the text of a telegram of congratulation from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan at his summer residence in the Bedford Springs Hotel in Pennsylvania which expressed a hope that it would prove  an additional link between the nations whose friendship is founded on their common interest and reciprocal esteem   The President responded that   it is a triumph more glorious  because far more useful to mankind  than was ever won by conqueror on the field of battle  May the Atlantic telegraph  under the blessing of Heaven  prove to be a bond of perpetual peace and friendship between the kindred nations  and an instrument destined by Divine Providence to diffuse religion  civilization  liberty  and law throughout the world        The messages were hard to decipher   Queen Victoria s message of    words took sixteen hours to send          These messages engendered an outburst of enthusiasm  The next morning a grand salute of     guns resounded in New York City  the streets were decorated with flags  the bells of the churches were rung  and at night the city was illuminated      On September   there was a parade  followed by an evening torchlight procession and fireworks display  which caused a fire in the Town Hall      Bright was knighted for his part  the first such honour to the telegraph industry       Failure of the first cable edit   William Thomson The operation of the      cable was plagued by conflict between two of the senior members of the project  Thomson and Whitehouse   The points of disagreement were highly relevant to the ultimate causes of the cable failure   Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career   He had no formal training in physics  all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience   The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson s law of squares when he presented it to a British Association meeting in        Thomson s law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation       To put this to the test  Bright gave Whitehouse overnight access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company s long underground lines       He joined several lines together to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declared that there would be no problem       Morse was also present at this test and supported Whitehouse       Thomson believed that Whitehouse s measurements were flawed and that underground and underwater cables were not fully comparable       Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed  which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares   In mid       on his own initiative  he examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two   But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option      Another point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying   Thomson favoured starting mid Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions   This would halve the time taken to complete   Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress could be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable       Whitehouse overruled Thomson s suggestion on the      voyage  but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid ocean start on the subsequent      voyage       Whitehouse  as chief electrician  was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel  but he declined to go at the last moment   He repeatedly found excuses to do this  for the      attempt  the trials in the Bay of Biscay      and the two attempts in            In       Thomson was sent in his place      and in      Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict  but in the event Thomson went alone       Thomson s mirror galvanometer edit   Thomson s mirror galvanometer After his experience on the      voyage  Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required   He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his mirror galvanometer   This was an extremely sensitive instrument  much better than any existing equipment   He requested        from the board to build several of them  but was only given      for a prototype  and permission to trial it on the next voyage       The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive  or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse  dash  and a Morse  dot   this was the standard system on submarine cables   both pulse types were the same length  unlike overland telegraph    Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment even over the vast length of the Atlantic cable   He successfully tested the instrument on       miles of cable in underwater storage at Plymouth      The mirror galvanometer proved to be yet another point of contention   Whitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme       He wanted to drive the line with a massive high voltage induction coil  producing several thousand volts  so that enough current was available to drive standard electromechanical printing telegraphs used on inland telegraphs       Thomson s instrument had to be read by hand   It was not capable of printing  but much later he invented the syphon recorder for the second transatlantic attempt in            The decision to start mid Atlantic combined with Whitehouse dropping out of another voyage left Thomson  on board Agememnon sailing towards Ireland  with a free hand to use his equipment without Whitehouse s interference   Although Thomson had the status of a mere advisor to engineer C  W  de Sauty  it was not long before all electrical decisions were deferred to him   Whitehouse in Valentia remained out of contact until the ship reached Ireland and landed the cable      Around this time  the board started to have doubts over Whitehouse s generally negative attitude   Not only did he repeatedly clash with Thomson  but he was also critical of Field  and his repeated refusal to carry out his primary duty as chief electrician on board ship made a very bad impression   With the removal of Morse  Whitehouse had lost his only ally on the board      but at this time no action was taken       Cable is damaged and Whitehouse dismissed edit   Wildman Whitehouse When the Agememnon reached Valentia on August    Thomson handed over to Whitehouse and the project was announced as a success to the press   Thomson had been receiving signals without problem throughout the voyage using the mirror galvanometer  but Whitehouse immediately connected his own equipment   The effects of the poor handling and design of the cable  coupled with Whitehouse s repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages  up to       volts  resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised   Whitehouse attempted to hide the poor performance and was vague in his communications   The expected inaugural message from Queen Victoria had been widely publicised and when this was not forthcoming the press started to speculate that there were problems   Whitehouse announced that five or six weeks would be required for  adjustments    The Queen s message had been received in Newfoundland  but Whitehouse had been unable to read the confirmation copy sent back the other way   Finally  on August     he announced receipt   What he did not announce was that the message had been received on the mirror galvanometer when he finally gave up trying with his own equipment   Whitehouse had the message re entered into his printing telegraph locally so that he could send on the printed tape and pretend that it had been received that way      In September       after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation  the cable failed altogether       The reaction to this news was tremendous  Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax  and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation   Whitehouse was recalled for the board s investigation and Thomson took over in Valentia tasked with reconstructing events  which at that stage  Whitehouse had successfully obfuscated   Whitehouse was held responsible for the failure  and dismissed       The damage to the cable may not have been entirely due to Whitehouse and it may have failed eventually anyway  although Whitehouse certainly brought that about much sooner   There may have been a preexisting fault  or weakness  in the cable  especially in the first hundred miles from Ireland   This section was the old      cable  spliced into the new lay  and was known to be poorly manufactured   Samples showed that in places the conductor was badly off centre  and could easily break through the insulation altogether through the mechanical strains on it during laying   Tests were conducted on samples of cable submerged in seawater   When perfectly insulated there was no problem applying thousands of volts   However  a sample with a pinprick hole  lit up like a lantern  when tested and a large hole was burned in the insulation      Although the cable was never put into service for public use  and never worked well  there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing   The collision between the Cunard Line ships Europa and Arabia was reported on    August  The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England  saving           A total of     messages were passed before failure

his efforts to revive the company were futile  It was not until      that  with the assistance of Thomas Brassey and John Pender  he succeeded in raising the necessary capital  The Glass  Elliot  and Gutta Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company  Telcon  later part of BICC   which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable  C F  Varley replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician     In the meantime  long cables had been submerged in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea  With this experience  an improved cable was designed  The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing     pounds per nautical mile     kg km   coated with Chatterton s compound  then covered with four layers of gutta percha  alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole  and bringing the weight of the insulator to     lb nmi     kg km   This core was covered with hemp saturated in a preservative solution  and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by Webster   Horsfall Ltd of Hay Mills Birmingham  each covered with fine strands of manila yarn steeped in the preservative  The weight of the new cable was       long hundredweight       lb  per nautical mile      kg km   or nearly twice the weight of the old  The Haymills site successfully manufactured        miles         km  of wire        tons   made by     workers over eleven months   Great Eastern and the second cable edit   Great Eastern at Heart s Content The new cable was laid by the ship Great Eastern captained by Sir James Anderson      Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of       nautical miles        km  of cable  and her decks furnished with the paying out gear  At noon on July           Great Eastern left the Nore for Foilhommerum Bay  Valentia Island  where the shore end was laid by Caroline  This attempt failed on August       when  after       miles       km  had been paid out  the cable snapped near the stern of the ship  and the end was lost       Great Eastern steamed back to England  where Field issued another prospectus  and formed the Anglo American Telegraph Company      to lay a new cable and complete the broken one  On July           Great Eastern started paying out once more  Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday  July     the expedition reached the port of Heart s Content in a thick fog  The next morning at   a m  a message from England cited these words from the leader in The Times   It is a great work  a glory to our age and nation  and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race    Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria   The shore end was landed during the day by Medway  Congratulations poured in  and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States  citation needed    Grappling hook used for lifting the cable In August       several ships  including Great Eastern  put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of       Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable  splice it to new cable  and complete the run to Newfoundland        They were determined to find it  and their search was based solely upon positions recorded  principally by Captain Moriarty  R N   who placed the end of the lost cable at longitude         W      There were some who thought it hopeless to try  declaring that to locate a cable     mi      km  down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack  However  Robert Halpin navigated HMS Terrible and grappling ship Albany to the correct location      Albany moved slowly here and there   fishing  for the lost cable with a five pronged grappling hook at the end of a stout rope  Suddenly  on August     Albany  caught  the cable and brought it to the surface  It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success  and that is how it turned out  During the night  the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again  This happened several more times  with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas  One time  a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him  Great Eastern and another grappling ship  Medway  arrived to join the search on the   th  It was not until over a fortnight later  in early September       that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on  it took    hours to get it safely on board Great Eastern  The cable was carried to the electrician s room  where it was determined that the cable was connected  All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea  The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold  and paid out to Heart s Content  Newfoundland  where she arrived on Saturday  September    There were now two working telegraph lines       Repairing the cable edit  Broken cables required an elaborate repair procedure  The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable  The repair ship navigated to the location  The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity  Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends           Communication speeds edit  Initially messages were sent by an operator sending Morse code  The reception was very bad on the      cable  and it took two minutes to transmit just one character  a single letter or a single number   a rate of about     words per minute  This was despite the use of the highly sensitive mirror galvanometer  The inaugural message from Queen Victoria took    minutes to transmit to Newfoundland  but it took a staggering    hours for the confirmation copy to be transmitted back to Whitehouse in Valentia      For the      cable  the methods of cable manufacture  as well as sending messages  had been vastly improved  The      cable could transmit eight words a minute          times faster than the      cable   Oliver Heaviside and Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin in later decades understood that the bandwidth of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive reactance  which causes a severe dispersion and hence a signal distortion  see telegrapher s equations  This has to be solved by iron tape or by load coils  It was not until the   th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even     words per minute  London became the world center in telecommunications  Eventually  no fewer than eleven cables radiated from Porthcurno Cable Station near Land s End and formed with their Commonwealth links a  live  girdle around the world  the All Red Line   Later cables edit  Additional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart s Content in                   and       By the end of the   th century  British   French   German   and American owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications  citation needed  The original cables were not fitted with repeaters  which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation   Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line   On telegraph lines this is done with relays  but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable  The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was TAT   in        This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters   Impact edit  A      study in the American Economic Review found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices      The study estimates that  the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to   percent of export value
