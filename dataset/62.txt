as  T nus    T nas   or  T nis   All three variations were mentioned by the Greek Syrian geographer al Rumi Yaqout in his Mu jam al B ldan  Dictionary of Countries   Different explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis  Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith   Tanit or Tanut   as many ancient cities were named after patron deities        Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes  which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present day Al Kasbah  Tunis s old Berber village        Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means  to lie down  or  to pass the night      The term Tunis can possibly mean  camp at night    camp   or  stop   or may have referred to as  the last stop before Carthage  by people who were journeying to Carthage by land  There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza  now El Kala   Thunusuda  now Sidi Meskin   Thinissut  now Bir Bouregba   and Thunisa  now Ras Jebel   As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads  they undoubtedly served as rest stations or stops      History edit  See also  Timeline of Tunis Carthage edit  Main articles  Carthage  Ancient Carthage  and History of Carthage Archaeological Site of CarthageUNESCO World Heritage SiteCriteriaCultural  ii  iii  viReference  Inscription       rd session Area       ha The historical study of Carthage is problematic  Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War  very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive  While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin  as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa     the main sources are Greek and Roman historians  including Livy  Polybius  Appian  Cornelius Nepos  Silius Italicus  Plutarch  Dio Cassius  and Herodotus  These writers belonged to peoples in competition  and often in conflict  with Carthage     Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily      and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage      Not surprisingly  their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile  while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view  these works have been lost          Ruins of the Baths

Artifacts from the siege of               Punic tombs     Early history edit  Tunis was originally a Berber settlement      The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the  th century BC      Situated on a hill  Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed  Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control  and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage  Thus  during Agathocles  expedition  which landed at Cape Bon in     BC  Tunis changed hands on various occasions  citation needed  During the Mercenary War  it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area      and that its population was mainly composed of peasants  fishermen  and craftsmen  Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage  the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large  According to Strabo  it was destroyed by the Romans in     BC during the Third Punic War  Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed  Tunis  however  was rebuilt first     under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry  The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni      In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa  Tunis had the title of mutatio   way station  resting place        Tunis  increasingly Romanized  was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop  However  Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time       Early Islamic period edit   Courtyard of Zaytuna Mosque  founded in the late  th century by the Umayyad dynasty When the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the  th century  they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes  and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation      The medina of Tunis  the oldest section of the city  dates from this period  during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al Nu man al Ghasani  The city had the natural advantage of coastal access  via the Mediterranean  to the major ports of southern Europe  Early on  Tunis played a military role  the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily  From the beginning of the  th century Tunis was the chef lieu of the area  it became the Arabs  naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea  and took on considerable military importance      Under the Aghlabids  the people of Tunis revolted numerous times      but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom  It was briefly the national capital  from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in      until         when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate  Local opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September      when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis  resulting in general pillaging          With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance  but the Sunni population tolerated Shi ite rule less and less  and carried out massacres against the Shi ite community      In      the Zirid ruler Al Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city s obedience to the Fatimids and re established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya  This decision infuriated the Shi ite caliph Al Mustansir Billah  To punish the Zirids  he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya  a large part of the country was set to the torch  the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in       and only a few coastal towns  including Tunis and Mahdia  escaped destruction  Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city  the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas  who was based in B ja a  in       The governor appointed by B ja a  having reestablished order in the country  did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital  This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations  and brought the region back to peace and prosperity        Historic map of Tunis by Piri Reis  The Walters Art Museum  New capital of Tunisia edit  In       the Almohad  Abd al Mu min took Tunis  overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis      The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia  Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia  Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital  In       Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and  a year later  took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty  The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez  Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom  surrounding the medina  the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis  In      the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France  who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity  King Louis easily captured Carthage  but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery  Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out   At the same time  driven by the reconquest of Spain  the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life      During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world  with a population of about          During this period  one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta  In his travel account  when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis  the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party  They all greeted them and were very curious  many were asking questions  however  no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta  greatly upsetting him  He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes  This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset  he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city  At the time  the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta s stay  the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place  The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival  in extravagant and most luxurious outfits  Abu Yahya arrived on horseback  where all of his relatives joined him  After the performance  the people returned to their homes       Spanish occupation and Ottoman control edit  See also  Ottoman Tunisia The Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in      when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan  who fled to the court of Charles V  Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain  Charles  suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba  Tunis  and Algiers  agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty  A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in       and the city was recaptured  The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid  The Spanish governor of La Goulette  Luys Peres Varga   fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city s defences between      and          Entry of Charles V into Tunis in      The Ottoman Ulu  Ali Reis  at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles  retook Tunis in       However  following the Battle of Lepanto in       the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October       Following these conflicts  the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August       Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople  the country attained a degree of autonomy  After       the Ottoman governors  Beys  were relatively independent  and both piracy and trade continued to flourish  Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys  the capital sprang into new life  Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities  among which were Moorish refugees from Spain  and economic activities diversified  To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates  then in their golden age  Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages        Mustapha Khaznadar  Prime Minister of Tunis from      to           and one of the most influential persons in modern Tunisian history      In April      the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping  Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply  with the result that Blake s fifteen ships attacked the Bey s arsenal at Porto Farina  Ghar el Melh   destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries  the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore  At the beginning of the   th century  Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty  Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings  During this period  the city prospered as a centre of commerce  Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house  Algerians captured Tunis in      and put the country under supervision  Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet  and the city experienced a rebellion in           Under the reign of Hussein Bey II  naval defeats by the British        and French        saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy      Various sources estimate the   th century population to have ranged from        to         inhabitants      During the later   th century  Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans  particularly the French  and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city  This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls  from       to accommodate growth in the suburbs  The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake  and the new districts were modernised with running water         lighting gas         roads  waste collection         and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre      The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat  as the newcomers increased trade with Europe  introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life   Development under the French protectorate edit

creation of the French protectorate in      was a turning point in Tunis s history  leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades  The city quickly spread out of its fortifications  it divided into a traditional Arab populated old city  and a new city populated by immigrants  with a different structure from that of the traditional medina  Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply  natural gas and electricity networks  public transport services and other public infrastructure  Under French rule  a substantial number of Europeans settled  like the Tunisian Italians   half of the population was European in origin      The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods  Tunis was quiet during the First World War  After the war  the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions  In addition  a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper  In the economic sphere  commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow  while traditional industry continued to decline  During World War II  Tunis was held by Axis forces from November      to May       It was their last base in Africa  as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east       On   May       at about       in the afternoon  Tunis fell to troops of British  st Army and the U S   st Army  which had defeated the German  th Panzer Army guarding the city  At midday on    May       the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar chal Galli ni  and Avenue Jules Ferry  to signal the end of fighting in North Africa      Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia  the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria  and then Sicily  and finally the mainland of Italy       Growth since independence edit   Extension of the city in the     s with the district of El Menzah After independence in       Tunis consolidated its role as the capital  first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs  In a very short time  the colonial city transformed rapidly  As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population  conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population  Because of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital  the city continued to grow  even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs  Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape  At the same time  an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy  The Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from      to       The Arab League  which represents    Arab nations  transferred its headquarters to Tunis in      because of Egypt s peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since       The Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis  from

others were injured      Five Japanese  two Colombians  and visitors from Italy  Poland  and Spain were among the dead  Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police  The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack           Geography edit  Tunis is located in north eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis  and is connected to the Mediterranean sea s Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette Halq al Wadi  The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part  The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe  The city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis  These hills contain places such as Notre Dame de Tunis  Ras Tabia  La Rabta  La Kasbah  Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above    metres      feet       The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S joumi  The isthmus between them is what geologists call the  Tunis dome   which includes hills of limestone and sediments  It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it  The roads also connect with Carthage  emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times  The Greater Tunis area has an area of         hectares         of which is urbanized  the rest being shared between bodies of water         hectares of lakes or lagoons  and agricultural or natural land          hectares   However  urban growth  which is estimated to be increasing by     hectares per year  is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl       A summer night in Tunis       Tunis bay at sunrise
