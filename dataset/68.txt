in French    and in Spanish     France    s programming is divided more or less equally between news coverage and news magazines or special reports  Along with     journalists of its own  France    can call on the resources of the two main French broadcasters  Groupe TF  and France T l visions  as well as partners such as AFP and RFI  The CEO of France    is Alain de Pouzilhac  From    May      and the Director of France    since      is Marc Saikali  France    unveiled a new schedule that prioritizes the morning and evening slots  anchored live by the network s editorial staff  More programming space than ever before goes to business  sport  culture  and studio discussion  In       France    started sharing its French language night time programming with the France based France Info  According to Marie Christine Saragosse  president and CEO of France M dias Monde   part of the value added of this public channel  would be the fact that   France    journalists  will be wide awake while others would be sleeping       History edit  Channel inception edit  The channel was created with the backing of president Jacques Chirac  with the aim of providing a French perspective of the news  which was dominated by English language media outlets      First project             edit  In       then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac expressed his desire for an international television news channel in French and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from France  Radio France Internationale  TV   and to a certain extent R seau France Outre Mer  and noted the collective offering was  fragmented  disorganised and ineffective   With the arrival of Fran ois Mitterrand as president in      and the naming of Michel Rocard as Prime Minister in       the government launched a new project  Canal France International  CFI   a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in French for foreign audiences  particularly in Africa  to be developed in parallel as a television channel  The First Gulf War of       relayed across the world by CNN International in particular  revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion  A parliamentary minister  Philippe S guin  wished to create a French language equivalent  In       after nineteen governmental reports in ten years  Prime Minister Alain Jupp  asked Radio France Internationale president Jean Paul Cluzel  who was also General Inspector of Finances  to create a French international news channel  Cluzel proposed in      to group TV   RFI  and CFI within a corporation entitled T l fi  The UMP led government decided to follow that recommendation but  with the return of the Socialist Party to government and the nomination of Hubert V drine  the new Minister of Foreign Affairs  favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV   which started to produce its own programming  notably its news bulletins  which in turn created its own news team  Additionally with the creation of EuroNews in       with French language commentary   the media presence of France overseas became more complex  more fragmented  and costlier  without being able to rely on a true round the clock international news channel   Relaunched project             edit  In       President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel   Is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the French language media on the international scene  Admittedly  we have with Agence France Presse a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce  notably in its international mission  Indeed  everyone here recognises the recent progress made by RFI  by TV   by CFI  thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies  But everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in French  capable of competing with the BBC or CNN   President Jacques Chirac  Address given at an  lys e Palace reception on    February       in honour of the High Council of the Francophonie     The recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers  a cultural area  which doesn t possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves  Let us question  in the time of terrestrial television networks  of satellite  of the internet  on our organisation in this domain  and notably in the dissipation of public funds which are reserved to them  On   March  speaking in the French Senate in front of foreign delegates to France  and as part of his presidential campaign  Chirac said   We must have the ambition of a big  round the clock news channel in French  equal to the BBC or CNN for the English speaking world  It is essential for the influence of our country  For our expatriates  it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland     After his reelection  the first reflections were engaged at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  headed by Dominique de Villepin  Various technical options were examined at the time  in an unreleased report   Purchase of EuroNews by the French State Creation of an external channel  proposed by then France T l visions President Marc Tessier  approved by the previous government  An international version of LCI  proposed by Groupe TF   which asked for a state subvention for the service  Strengthening of TV  s news service  as suggested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  The subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq reassured the authorities about the project  especially in February       when the American broadcasters CNN  FOX News  and MSNBC opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the United Nations Security Council after Dominique de Villepin gave his address on the Iraq conflict      On    March       Matignon opened offers to   Elicit the development of an international news channel  Broadcasting primarily in the French language  this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of France in the worldwide battle of images  and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news  marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs  by its culture and by its own ideas  and to value its historical links and its privileged geography  The international news channel must contribute to a long lasting strategy of influence of France in the world      By the application deadline on    April       three candidates replied   France T l visions   RFI  to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector  Groupe TF    proposed an international version of its LCI channel  Groupe Canal    proposed a news  factory  to reinforce its i T l  channel  already seen in    countries but running at a financial loss  One month later  a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion  voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly  to form a public owned corporation  groupement d int r t public  grouping all of the public broadcasters  France T l visions  RFO  RFI  TV  and AFP  with the goal of launching the channel at the end of       Ignoring the work of the parliamentary commission  the government asked a member of the assembly  Bernard Brochand  to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel  something which the parliamentary commission did not demand  Brochard attempted to group both Groupe TF  and Groupe Canal   with no success  He then proposed a       partnership between France T l visions and Groupe TF   whilst at the same time rejecting RFI   both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally  TF  with its LCI channel and France T l visions  editorial teams at France   and France     Preparing for launch             edit  Defying parliament edit  After a press conference in January       President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year  However  various disputes began to surface  The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework  Unionised journalists working for France T l visions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector  calling it  the marriage of the snake and the rabbit   Radio France International was angry that it would not be associated with the project  A headline published in Le Monde described the partnership having a  public channel  private owner       while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of    million euro  compared with     million euro for BBC World   Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as TV   Facing discontentment  the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin delayed all discussion of the project in       Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on    July that the channel would not be funded before       which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill  However  the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the  lys e  a press conference by Raffarin on   December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in        I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France T l visions and TF   As desired by the President  the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies  and will promote the expression of a French vision  more necessary than ever in the world today  The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel  to a total of    million euro       The amendment was carried the same day in the National Assembly   Public private angst edit  The start of      concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the European Union and the relevant competition commissions  Trade union members working for France T l visions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March       The newly elected president of the public corporation  Patrick de Carolis  who assumed his position in the summer  and who had been accused of being too close to the President   expressed doubts about an alliance with TF    To be effective  you need a single driver in a car       He insisted that the channel be made available within France  which the members of parliament required  and which TF   wanting to protect its own news channel LCI  could object to  Patrick Le Lay  president of TF   gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties  and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France T l visions  These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities  obtained this time round without difficulty   Birth             edit  The launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the Ministry of Culture and Communication  headed by Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres on    November         The project of the International French News Channel  abbreviated in French to CFII       will allow us to propose our own country s vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world       Alain de Pouzilhac  former CEO of Havas  was named president  along with two deputies  one each from group partners TF  and France T l visions  Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII  against the wishes of TF   would be broadcast within mainland France      However  TF  wished to launch its news channel LCI onto the digital terrestrial platform  In order to placate TF   CFII was due to be broadcast via satellite and cable  On    April       Le Monde announced that the managers of the forthcoming channel found its initial name difficult to pronounce  CFII  in French pronounced as C F I I or C F   I       A new name was announced on    June        France     pronounced France vingt quatre   This decision was taken by the Supervisory Board  chaired by France T l vision president Patrick de Carolis  who made the choice from a list of five potential names  France    launched on   December       initially available online as a web stream  followed by satellite

one in English and the other in French    Since April      the channel increased its reach  airing programmes in Arabic for viewers in the Maghreb  North Africa and the Middle East  citation needed  Two months after launch  a survey conducted by TNS Sofres indicated that     of respondents in France questioned thought France    was  useful and essential       but questions have arisen concerning the France    name being too Franco centric for an international news channel       State takes over edit  In      Groupe TF  ceded its share in the channel to a government owned holding company  Soci t  de l audiovisuel ext rieur de la France  AEF   whilst conversely committing to producing programmes for the channel until       Despite the launch of France     the fragmentation of public broadcasting overseas continues  The total budget for external broadcasting from France totalled     million euro each year  Following the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as president in May       a  steering committee  of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June       President Sarkozy called on Bernard Kouchner and Christine Albanel  respectively Foreign Minister and Culture Minister to reform the current system  The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium  Switzerland and Canada Qu bec  as the public broadcasters involved in TV   of which the French government holds a     share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold     each  consider TV  to be a promoter of the wider French language world      Just one month after France    s launch  TV  renamed itself TV Monde  As published in the Journal Officiel de la R publique Fran aise of    January       a Decree for    January      appeared  authorising the company France T l visions to cede its share in the capital of the France    company      The same Decree transferred its share to the Soci t  de l audiovisuel ext rieur de la France  AEF   which made AEF sole shareholder of France     for the sum of   million euro       Under one maison       present  edit  President Nicolas Sarkozy announced on   January      that he was in favour of reducing France    s programming to French only      In January      AEF announced a merger between France    and Radio France International  a procedure finalised on    February       It is expected that staff from Radio France International
